26858_1,It was only recently where a group of misfits that,was able to gather power that force their view points on to others.,and
35898_4,It did not take them very long to let us know that Afghanistan is much like the United States.,Afghanistan would have continued to be like the USA had the government here not absolutely demolished their nation.,and

36183_3,"On the video, Bassim explains how the military involvement does not change.",The United States president changes.,and
25513_1,I thought his goal in teaching empathy was to just show that his house and cars and family looked a lot like families here in Pennsylvania.,We're not much different.,and

34553_3, I did not want to offend them in any way.,"Finding out some of their reasons why, I realized how symbolic it is.",because
36005_5,Every situation even dealing with death of loved ones.,Religion has inspired or motivated the man to continue. ,and
29070_1,Who personally in my opinion it seemed like it was kinda rehearsed,Which was like a generic response i mean it isn't being spoken from experience,and

32992_2,He brought up how people do not talk about how Christians killing other people that, we do not see it that way  we live in a Christian land  we do not recognize,because
33826_1,I can see how other people (extremists) can definitely read into the bible.,I can see how they create a Christian sharia law.,and
11660_2,I have been trying to get better at learning and retaining information better since being in college.,the fact will always remain that I need good grades to attract potential employers.,and
36535_3,"He tried to help her, but she completely ignored him.","She ran the opposite direction, right into the white males trap.",and
29495_6, to hurt my heart but  open my eyes  they experience that, many of the same things  us but on a more extreme level.,because
10107_3,I would do things back in the Caribbean she did not like.,It was the same with her doing things.,and
34264_1,They are just practicing what they believe in.,They have every right to do so.,and
37738_1,Sam began by pointing it out in our Soc 119 class.,He was showing us what ethnic relations are really like.,so
40593_1,People claim they are that way due to sociological factors.,They refuse to say it's due to genetics or predisposed reasons.,because
21081_1,"As you can see, that is a part of that man's culture today.",To get all the criminals out of there no matter who it is.,and
40373_3,For killing his family.,For bombing his house.,and
23565_1,This class discussion showed me that this issue is much bigger than just me.,It's bigger than my personal experiences.,and
38675_3,Many of the text's messages need to be filtered.,They need to be filtered by today's standards.,so
21988_1,We focus on our country's issues.,We turn a blind eye to international issues not directly related to the United States.,and
20462_1,I am happy.,He now understands the meaning of kindness.,Nan
36544_3, it's important to note that this bible was written  long ago., the technology we would have.,so
23276_3,I do not know how I would survive in that country.,It is hard to imagine my life compared to what it is right now.,and
21697_2,we are shown pictures of people and their families in Afghanistan.,I don't believe we truly want to see these pictures.,because
39771_3,It is unhuman to send bombs on innocent humans.,They are human just like we are.,because
37816_1,It is safe to say that most people would feel the same way I would .,Would associate a stigma with all Americans being evil.,and
40403_1,I think as a country we continue to take two steps forward and then two steps back.,no matter what there is some sort of racism or at least negative stereotyping of other cultures religions countries.,and
37503_1,It was frightening to me.,I was taught things that I blatantly did not believe.,because
28522_1,I remember learning about this term in psych my senior year of high school.,I remember learning about this term last year.,and

9114_1,Children are still going to learn about their country's history.,This is for good reason.,and
40321_2,Forgiveness is really a true theme that strides across all faces of humanity.,It's a really powerful method to cope with difficulty.,and
38329_2,Remotely close to what Bassim has faced., I can't even imagine how difficult this is.,and
30312_5,Few change what is written.,Few take it far.,and
24628_1,People choose what they want to take seriously in religion and politics.,They choose what they let slide in religion.,and
39242_1,the story he soon told was heart warming.,it was heart warming.,Nan
33371_1,"I don't think this should be the mindset of people though, I think it is good to ",have our beliefs challenged  we can grow from these circumstances  be more knowledgeable.,because
35115_1,These are the things that I found interesting in Sam's lecture during this video.,He hopes that we can learn to empathize with others in the same way.,and
20579_1,Younger generations are more freethinking.,They are willing to accept change.,and
39269_1,How prosperous Bosim's life was.,Was something that struck me.,Nan
20112_4,They don't see a place where people have families.," and live, just like us.",and
12257_1,I was taught that history didn't remember anyone who looked like me.,"Thus, I assumed they didn't exist.",so
32531_1,"can I may not have any connection to Basim, but I",do have a connection to the Iraq War,Nan
32287_2,I think that it takes a certain amount of humility.,confidence to wear something everyday that outwardly expresses .,and
29416_7, that a ton of people are affected much more heavily than we are on a daily basis by these terrorists., we need to see that they need our help more than anyone.,and
14333_1,Everyone has their own unique qualities.,Stereotypes or any other judgments should not get in the way of learning who an individual is.,and
21801_1,He has young daughters.,He is a normal person who practices law.,Nan
34501_2,They will try to disassociate themselves from it.,They gravitate towards something familiar.,and
27130_1,You can't blame an entire country for the wrong doings of a couple people.,I think that's something we can learn from Basim.,and
29678_1,That is why we can amend the constitution.,There are many amendments.,and
30556_4,They could work things out., and eventually feel the need to not divorce.,because
35826_3,People are allowed to do mostly whatever they would like with their lives. ,"On a moral level, I can’t decide if this correct. ",and
27153_1,I've never read the Bible or Quran.,I'm certain it teaches good positive ways of living.,and
35180_6, many people were killed and taken from their families.,"lynchings,  many different crimes.",so
31766_5,All of the parties involved must respectful.,They must be able to acknowledge that other takes on the sacred text are valid too. ,so
37825_1,Using one book to guide your life off of is hard. ,Using one book to base almost every decision off of is hard.,and
25672_1,I think people are so compelled and fascinated by their own religion.,People are not able to disagree with others without pointing it out and causing more issues.,Nan
8009_1,These are the sort of discussions we should have on race.,Not why it's a problem or how big of a problem it is.,Nan
37989_2,It is  important to always be positive.,Optimistic in life.,so
7562_1,at one point in my life I thought we talked about race too much.,I thought racism was still being kept alive because everyone was talking about it.,and
38376_4,After everything that happened.,You would have no idea how wonderful it looked.,Nan
31299_6,How could everyone agree on a book?,that is all interpretation; I dont think you can.,and
27505_3,Which they have the weapons,That the ability to push it under a religious agenda.,because
40053_2,Lives are not something that can be brought or replaced.,They are something unique.,and
23040_1,humanity should let go of control of the matter., let God handle it.,and
22179_1,In my past discussion group we talked about whether backlash is a positive or negative thing.,I believe that in our class it is usually always positive.,and
32162_4,It is the system,It is the government.,and
37724_2,He witnessed such horrific events.,He does not take that out on other people.,and
11734_5,We need to speak more about it to come to terms.,We can accept our past to learn from it.,and
41420_4,He understood them.,He understood their lives.,and
28439_3,Sam showed pictures of the houses.,Sam showed pictures of city life in Afghanistan.,and
42083_3,it is more painful to hold onto anger.," give in , forgive.",because
38987_3,he has friends who are American.,American were very helpful to him.,and
15815_1,There are cultural aspects to sports.,The cultural aspects are with who wants to play them.,and
33369_2,Someone has different beliefs or views from ours.,Does not make what they are doing believing wrong.,because
8051_1,"Milo Yiannoplouss. speaker of alt right matters, was permanently banned from twitter.",Youtube star Pewdiepies who promoted hate was suspended.,and
21399_1,It is definitely more difficult to become informed than to just listen.,It would be beneficial.,so
39403_1,He was angry at first.,who wouldn't be angry.,and
39800_6,I felt terrible for what had occurred afterwards.,between the American Government and Basim as a form of repayment.,Nan
34711_1,The body is a temple.,I had never thought that showing off your body was a way of expressing this idea.,and
35379_3,His faith helped him not to be angry.,The subject does not make him wincey.,and
41052_2,Unfounded claims may justify violence.,Violence may by justified to achieve their goals.,because
10119_1,I agree with Sam.,People make such bold statements.,Nan
27361_3,They include the abolishment of certain foods.,They have ridiculous punishments for crimes.,and
26520_1,This is an example of interpreting the Bible differently.,People place more value on one segment over another.,and
40873_4,The lecture helped me handle my roommate issues.,The lecture helped me with my family.,and
35525_1,"In a class like this, it is important to keep the lectures relevant .",discussions should be relevant to engage the student.,and
34659_4,there are good people in the world., and some people had no control in what happens in the wars.,because
14046_3,People are all very much alike.,"Yet, we all possess these traits that act like a metaphorical key to our ancestral map.",so
34994_2,Some Buddhists think that the right karma involves killings for justice.,It only contradicts the Buddha's teachings.,Nan
29406_3,which through all of his pain sadness,the government did this to his family individual american citizens,and
34639_2,You can agree to disagree.,You can tolerate one another.,and
39143_5,I try to think about the pain.,I try to think about the suffering he went through.,and
16337_1,This caused the opposite of what they wanted to happen.,Our town remains very monotonous in culture.,and
32040_4,The US dismantles a lot of things.,They do this for their benefit for whatever the case may be. ,and
15291_1,Ancestry will always be an interesting thing to me.,It so cool how people have those distinctive traits that set them aside from everyone else.,because
42672_1,We should be more understanding of what is going on around us.,We should take action to help.,and
41854_3,It is happing all over the country.,It is happening to various families as well.,and
39171_1,The message  Basim wanted to get across to the class is that anger is not be a reliable solution to a problem that exists.,anger can not be a reliable solution to a problem that exists.,and
37277_5,Experiences like these teaches them first hand that their initial thoughts may be wrong,you may be surprised on what you have to hear.,and
24817_1,They speak about how brutal it seems., They go on to engage in similar behaviors.,because
8202_6,Women give birth., so god must be a woman.,and
31694_3,I agree with you that laws created from religious texts are now probably outdated.,They have been in legal codes for very long.,so
26996_2,The laws provide women equality.,Right to education for women.,and
40971_2,"Only at the level where hes able to avoid being an emotional wreck,","To the point where hes able to have a calm, rational conversation in a room most likely containing a pretty decent amount of under-informed, privileged college kids.",Nan
24851_1,I easily forget.,"There are people in Afghanistan who are just like us, Americans.",so
38217_4,It is very powerful.,The truth is sorry.,because
12469_2,Whites were master.,How such a twisted mindset has prevailed never made sense to me?,and
36778_1,I've never experienced the devastation of my house being bombed.,I've not had my family members murdered by a foreign government.,and
11961_1,No group has the right to say that they are better than another group.,"Genetically, we are not.",because
39406_2,Before the United States War on Terror.,They left the country before the conflict happened.,Nan
28583_2,The media controls what we don't see.,The media influences our opinions of others.,and
40426_3,Basim went through phases of anger.,Basim went through phases of depression.,and
31931_6,"petty  inconvenient, we should look back to Basim  how he",forgave the actions done to him,and
35974_1,Something tragic happened to him.,He doesn't hate America as a whole.,and
30856_1,I found this lecture very interesting.,I grew up only knowing the Bible.,because
42712_4,People can attempt to rebuild their lives., although they will never be the same.,and
22909_1,It is difficult to remember that our soldiers have children and families back at home.,It seems easier to believe that it is simply just a job to be fighting for our country.,and
21797_2,We try to console them.,We try to help them upon returning home to see they can cope.,and
35483_3,Basim was kind.,It gave me a whole new perspective of everything. ,and
11986_2,It must happen.,We all become of one mixed race.,Nan
21822_2,"We see it as us, the good guys, going to war to fight the bad guys over there.",We never stop and think about the good people over there.,Nan
19214_1,What does the average soldier know about the culture of countries they invade?,What do they know about their practices?,and
19117_2,He met them under stressful conditions.,He was an intruder in their country.,and
25651_1,It is the way we grew up.,"It is what we learned from news, our parents, our school.",and
21278_1,They have highlighted the differences between the Christian faith and Islamic faith.,We talked about this in this class.,and
9088_3,Educating people is the best way to combat ignorance.,and prejudice.,and
21536_1,I have only heard of Sharia Law being associated with Islamic faith.,It is the understandings that guide one on the path to heaven.,Nan
40801_1,It is a tragedy that this happens regularly.,Bringing more troops in will not solve the problem.,and
35294_1,I really agree with this statement.,"I've seen different rituals, traditions, religions, etc.",because
19024_1,All these citizens want is for the fighting to stop in their backyard.,They want to live in peace and have a pace for their family to grow up.,so
19153_2,Ideas like killing innocent people.,And fighting against other people in wars as a way to solve problems.,because
33819_1,His family had a very nice house.,did his brother.,and
24388_1,Clearly there are occasions where it is necessary and important to open up that dialogue.,It feels as though over the past few years it has become almost excessive.,Nan
40309_3,He showed shopping malls.,Very similar to what I am used to.,and
8553_1,There were only a few Mexicans.,There was only one Chinese girl in my high school graduating class of 320 people.,and
35478_1,It was a disrespectful action that Basim rejected.,Now trying to sue the government for wrong doing.,and
21104_2,We can remain free.,We can protect our rights.,and
42383_2,They don't have to wear a burkini all the time.,They can swim normally.,and
11793_1,"Starting with the last paragraph, I agree that racism is an issue everywhere.","Although we talk about racism so much, I do not believe that is why it is portrayed so strongly in the U.S.",and
36236_3,we never hear anything about radical christians.,christians killing other people,and
31164_1,People make themselves out to be super religious that,devout but sin in  many ways.,so
40823_3,Who discusses waht to do.,What he does for his occupation.,Nan
35457_6,Basim was speaking about what he had experienced.,"I sat there wondering, how?",and
20048_1,Young students are constantly being taught about racial issues of the past.,They automatically have the idea installed in their head that the nation was built off these issues.,and
16214_2,The conclusions are based off so little information.,It shows how we are completely ignorant.,Nan
12515_1,This majority is slowly decreasing.,We see more races come every year.,and
38468_1,I believe that no man should be able to have that much authority over another man.,Any system that allows for that needs to be overthrown.,and
33540_2,Basim smiled.,Basim laughed.,and
32086_1,I think people are scared of Sharia law.,They don't like how the word Sharia sounds to them.,because
20103_1,As citizens of the United States we do not really think of these injured people.,We are not entirely to blame.,and

42379_3,They have a lot of opportunites.,They have personal choices of when to wear it.,and
30488_1,By looking at the criteria that the real passages of the bible list  singling out one part., of it to focus on  use  a basis to attack  exclude a certain group of people.,and
23862_1,Perhaps a better alternative would be integrating more learning about the world in the school system to fulfill curiosity.,Understanding of different cultures would be embedded at a younger age.,so
41699_1,This specific part of the lecture was especially interesting to me.,Basim talked about what life in Mosul is like today.,because
40527_3,I had a hard time imagining.,There would have been pain.,and

31221_1,"In Afghanistan, the wife has a specific amount of care they can count on receiving.","In Afghanistan, the children have a specific amount of care they can count on receiving.",and

40477_3,He saw how great the American people were.,He knew he couldn't hate all Americans.,and
37876_6,It is amazing to me that he can continue to respect his American friends.,speak to his American friends.,and
35397_1,I believe forgiveness is most important to the person who was wronged.,He can move mast an obstacle they faced in the past.,so
33159_5,He still lives on. ,and still has compassion.,and
9551_1,It is predominantly played by white guys.,I believe this is due to cultural differences.,and
33359_6,"there are other teachings (sex  marriage, marriage is only a man  a woman) ",is outdated  encourages hate in our society.,and

32825_3,The video clip explains it simply cant be done effectively.,A small book like the Bible just cannot cover everything needed to govern every aspect of every day life.,and
25955_1,You have such a quick and radical change in power.,You must learn to be quickly surrounded by new things.,so
36578_1,"I also like how Basim rather than bash America, does the complete opposite.",He starts complementing us.,and

23806_3,People can pick out anything they don't like about you.,They can just decide they don't like you as a person.,because

15502_1,African Americans were never given any reparations for ancestors who were slaves,"Native Americans still fight for respect, as well as boundaries over land.",and
10773_3,We did not protest like Evergreen State.,We talked about racial issues.,because

11815_1,I think all cultures are interesting.,I love learning about where people are from.,and
42264_4,It was meant to make people look at something from a different perspective.,I feel as if it's working.,and
23866_1,Rafi showed us that the culture in the middle east is very similar to our culture.,Many of the beliefs of Americans are wrong about these people.,and
7677_3,We never talk about it.,That makes us uncomfortable.,Nan
38775_1,I understand.,Afghanistan was very modern.,and
30849_1,"Arianna, the things that youve mentioned actually sound rather similar to my reply on this thread.",I'm thankful that we share two different viewpoints that are very much identical.,so
41405_1,Everyone believes in their own religion or personal preferences.,Everyone should have the right to. ,and
9730_1,I just observe who the people around me are.,It is always eye opening to realize that each person I see has a different backstory.,and
15721_2,At Penn State I am friends with a girl who is Latina.,The girl has bright blue eyes and white skin.,Nan
35953_1,Sam asks the class to change their perspective to that of a normal Muslim person.,Normal Muslim's on the other side of the world look at the US.,and
8542_2,He uses it as a channel for low ball insults.,He uses it for rants.,and
38340_1,Sometimes are issues are so different.,Sometimes we might be surprised to find we have many things in common.,and
32234_1,I found it interesting.,The Quran is a book of fables.,and
10707_2,It always blows my mind that two people on the absolute opposite sides of one land mass eventually married.,The chances were of my existence happening at all were very small.,and
32435_1, Basim explained how he lost his house,"family members, he himself was injured due to this",and
36970_1,His house was destroyed.,His city was destroyed too.,and
14791_2,There was no Chinese.,There was no Japanese.,Nan
38761_2,There are right and wrong answers to this discussion.,Truth of the matter ultimately rest with the women who wear them.,Nan
19840_1,The media is igniting peoples hostility on Afghanistan.,The media on mainstream willfully and bombastically report the dark side of this country.,and
26283_3,My only concept of war is the fact that my grandfather fought in World War II.,We seem to always be at war.,so
29831_3,I hope for peace.,"Mr. Rafi said to believe that peace will, one day, win.",and
40384_3,I think this man is very strong,He was able to overcome this.,because
25923_1,I've never really thought about how much we turn a blind eye. ,Sam brought up a good point about how many hate groups are Christian groups. ,Nan
36059_2,He just has a problem with the government.,He is rightfully so.,and
25576_2,That they have experienced unspeakable tragedies.,Its heartbreaking to know that there are many more people out there just like them who have grown accustomed to this uncertain way of living.,so
35821_2,I have been more aware of the grudges I will possibly hold in the future. ,I want to try to work on being more forgiving in all aspects of my life. ,and
35146_1,What we did in the class.,not bashing America.,Nan
37081_1,He mentions that he talks about Islam a lot.,He is trying to make people more comfortable about the Muslim.,because
36451_1,It is easy to hear stories of tragedy. ,It is easy not to be affected by them. ,and
36303_1,I thought this was a beautiful lesson.,One that members of Christian backgrounds would do to recognize as similar to the beliefs on forgiveness within Christian faith denominations.,and
11734_7,We can accept our past to learn from it.,not repeat it in our future.,so
31051_1,We should not look at it as negative.,It is how Christians would view the Old Testament.,because
41431_5,It's necessary to flip the script.,It's necessary to put yourself at the other end of the discussion.,so
32324_4,I want to study different religions not to make a decision regarding one religion versus another.,I want to study different religions to live by what I believe is right.,so
36619_1,I understand why he is angry.,I could never imagine going through what he has overcome.,and
34072_1,This week I chose the video Bassim's Advice to the Class.,It really resonated with me.,and
37989_8,YOu will be miserable.,Have no hope.,because
38759_1,The hijab is part of the muslim religion.,The women that wear the hijab do not see it as sexist.,so
24526_1,My morals were built from my religion. ,My morals come from how I was raised. ,and
37453_2,He spoke very fondly of his wife,was nice to hear him speaking  fondly of them.,and
30720_2,As long as no one is forcing their beliefs teachings on anyone.,There should be no judgement.,and
30648_1,It actually makes me really happy that they are similar religions.,"I think when more people learn that, it could really bind them together.",because
33925_1,The ignorance of this was shocking to me.,It's not really shocking.,and
37834_1,"In conclusion, I can understand how people can radicalize the bible by picking and choosing what the want to follow.", I can understand how people can interpret the bible  in their own way.,and
21038_4,they were all very kind.,They were welcoming.,and
40579_1,"Therefore, change can only be made one person at a time.","If all learn to forgive the way Basim did, then there is a chance the world can be a better place again.",and
42279_1,I feel as if our society makes people feel less of themselves.,The hijab actually takes that feeling away.,and
32376_1,For some reason it is believed that people of different religions don't get along.,They have such different beliefs.,because
37880_2,It made me think more about the decisions our country makes.,Especially when sending people to war.,and
40591_2,We Facetime someone who has had family killed.,We Facetime someone who has lived through Taliban rule.,and
41384_6,I was confused whether the students were representing Americans from past years.,They crossed between the two views without an explanation. ,because
22932_1,They both exist to teach people why they are here.,They teach what they should do with their lives.,and
41934_5,He focused on what really happened. ,He focused on who it is okay to blame. ,and
34620_1,"Isis has invaded his hometown, he is going through something horrific.",I applaud being  open to talking about it all.,so
38227_5,His young daughter passed away during the war.,I sincerely started to show empathy for him from that point  on.,and
38843_1,citizens in other countries might view all US presidents the same.,Imagine US presidents claim they will change their foreign policy from the previous president.,because
24728_1,They do not want to be at war.,They do want peace.,and
29422_1,I grew up.,I began to forge my own thoughts.,and
40169_2,Getting up to continue to live your life,hats how your loved one would have wanted  you.,and
34235_2,I can really understand.,I can choose for myself.,and
27433_3,It took me by surprise that he was able to get to know the civilans.,He was able to get information on the military so easily.,and
39200_1,I used to have something against Islam., I have heard of these heart wrenching stories.,because
38538_3,he speaks to us with such kindness,He was telling us how to forgive ,and
36467_3,It challenges me to think about things I normally wouldn't feel comfortable thinking about.,That's a great thing.,because
39238_1,Basim said he wasn't angry at Americans.,Anger would've consumed him internally.,because
41092_2,I admire how he turned to his religion to help him cope with what happened. ,His religion helped him realize he must continue his life. ,and
24923_4,The people are different.,Others see it a threat.,because
35727_1,He wouldnt let the anger and sadness consume him.,He wouldn't let it take over his life.,and
35407_4,He has a positive attitude/,He has little anger.,and
39138_2,Bassim had to leave his own country.,That he has loved for so long.,so
41521_2,I don't think I could ever forgive the people.,Who were the ones to blame.,Nan
8209_1,"Sam was really into learning about the topic, Sufism.",Sam wasn't ashamed to accidentally turn into one.,and
21512_1,I took many history classes.,It really interested me.,because
15161_1,Every country has people that are thriving.,They are excelling in life.,and
37582_2,the lawshould limit their rights.,Law should limit their media usage.,and
36483_1,I watched the video.,I commented on the video.,and
39935_6,Rafi was so optimistic regarding the future of Afghanistan.,Rafi was so determined regarding the future of Afghanistan.,and
10535_3,Voice our opinions in a more respectful manner.,We would be able to reach solutions much faster and easier.,and
30084_2,The Bible is interpreted differently.,The interpretation of the Bible differs in almost every single reader.,and
33463_2,He could have many reasons to be upset.,He could have many reasons to be angry with them.,and
11924_2,I started to realize they are able to find thier faith in this young age was not themselves.,They were raised like that.,and
22821_1,we give a pencil or a T-shirt.,I felt bad that they are putting in much effort.,so
32350_1,I think my interaction with this person reflects many Christians naive prejudices against Muslims.,I think my interaction with this person reflects many Christians innate prejudices against Muslims.,and
29240_1,That entire class was moving to me., Rafi talk about how everyday he leaves his house.,and
39808_2,A student had asked him.,He wasn't angry about the whole situation.,and
38952_1,He has inspired me to keep my eyes open to more things that are going on around me.,do not let previous negative events cloud my judgement on something.,and
32133_4,I grew up in the United States.,I only ever heard negative rhetoric about people committing terrorism acts.,because
41003_1,We have little respect for other countries. ,We have little respect for other countries' civilians.,and
42399_3,We are blind to see that the stem of our hatred towards other countries ., this is our own citizens.,and
15455_4,"It is a great way for people, including myself, to learn more about how to talk about race.",it is a great way for people to understand all perspectives.,because
14833_2,He really removed the cluttered aspect of differences.,He centralized everything for me.,and
35442_2,it is not right to blame every individual associated with a country for the governments wrongdoing.,it would be unfair to blame every Afghani for violence conducted by a handful of extremist Afghani people,Nan
31378_5,They do not understand how Muslims feel.,They place Muslim extremists in a different category. ,so
33097_2,Classify all Muslims as violent killers.,They associate this religion with violent actions.,and
36509_1,With President Trump proposing more aggressive military action and behavior in the Middle East I fear that the United States may be soon causing more harm to these people.,This will subject them to more poverty instead of protecting them and allowing them to rebuild their homes.,Nan
37005_2,he has learned to forgive., I think thats the most admirable thing Ive ever heard.,and
21704_2,Our founders created our laws based loosely on the Bible and Christian ideals.,I also knew that religion plays a huge role in Muslim people's lives.,and
31590_3, this idea that the middle east is not where they should be where, they want to be  other countries have not let them evolve.,because
42195_5,It's racist. ,It's police hating actions by Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke when a black man shot the officer 15 times.,because
29133_1,he did this using actual facts from today society,"in the past, he switch the information so it applied to opposite race",and
15778_2,I really did feel comfortable and grateful.,I was able to see how everyone was different.,Nan
24643_1,It seems that almost every day there is news about some type of conflict or bombing that happened in the Middle East.,I feel like you start to become desensitized to the situation.,and
37597_2,Hate has this notion of loathing.,When do not let our hate control us we will not ever get to that point.,and
26747_2,Sharia is getting your hand cut off if you steal something.,Sharia is implemented in Islamic culture,and
33804_1,The news that a famous celebrity was having a baby.,the news spread in the span of 5 minutes.,Nan
34991_1,It is bringing down a race based on the way the people look,It is all from ideas that have been developed years and years ago,because
16134_1,"At the same time, I believe that it is talked about too much in the media.",It brings so much attention to the news outlets reporting on issues about race.,because
9674_2,"Instead, these men should be looked down upon.",They should be made accountable for what they did.,and
23725_4,It is easier to comprehend., and understand.,so
27936_6, it hurts him.,how broken damaged the city of Mosul has become.,and
41369_1,I feel that the only one a woman could be oppressed by wearing a hijab.,If she wants to not where one is being forced against her will to do so.,Nan
35209_3,I think that person is un-Christian.,many people look at a member of ISIS and think that person is an Islamic radical.,and
13976_1,There in lies the problem.,Preferences to not equal racist tendencies.,because
24386_3,I would like to know their outlook.,People in other countries live in this terror.,Nan
41427_2,After the devastating events of 9 11.,We made the hasty decision to fight back with hate.,Nan
23407_1,"Over time, I have begun to realize that it is much deeper than that.",This is really true in this class.,so
39086_4,Hold grudges over little things.,People like Basim who have it way worse.,and
31644_1,That quality right there reminds me of the Afghan people., who invite complete strangers into their homes to share a meal.,Nan
8372_1,In those areas you will find a large following of hockey fans.,In warmer climates you will find a larger following of basketball.,and
26675_1,I found this very interesting,the main topic was sharia law in America and Muslim countries,because
40939_4,A lot of Americans stereotype a culture they don't understand.,There may not be many culture differences from our own. ,and
38658_2,The civilians do not deserve hatred directed at them.,Radical group  took over.,because
42080_3,my family was killed.,I could see myself living in a world of anger the rest of my life.,and
15033_1,The caste system also discriminated against people of darker skin.,"It made them easily identifiable to the lighter-skinned, upper-caste citizens.",because
42715_2,It is not surprising to me. ,I honestly wondered the same thing.,because
36389_1,Having these experiences is eye opening to what happens around the world.,That is how terrible things can be.,so
12515_3,This majority is slowly decreasing.,We see more races come every year.,Nan
28577_3,It tends to just try and paint Christianity in a more positive light.,It ignores parts that are controversial.,because
28071_3,I could see his side of the story.,I could see how it affected him.,and
39457_3,You're only experience with another country is devastating.,You will only base your judgment off of that event.,and
41455_1,I think that is a perfect conversation to have.,It is a hot topic right now.,because
14592_1,people are genetically similar.,we all look different.,so
8502_1,I agree with what you said.,It was wrong to use social media for the purpose of attacking Hayden.,Nan
42707_3,This is another part of something.,This is another part of what happened.,Nan
35978_2,No matter how far apart we are we all go through inner conflicts.,Some are much worse than others.,and
30944_1,Christians have multiple passages to use a basis to construct or society.,Christians will select multiple passages to use a basis to construct or society,and
19777_1,"Nicole, I really enjoyed reading your post.",I completely agree with your opinion on this topic.,and
39959_3,"We, a Christian society, don't talk about how Christians kill each other.",It is easier to say the people over there kill people.,because
19618_1,The United States needs to work efficiently with local governments.,They must work effectively to succeed in their operations.,and
31321_4,It has nothing to do with me.,It doesn't affect my life.,and
23100_1,I saw what was really going on over there.,I saw how this war is impacting its people so much.,and
24382_1,This is something I don't think about.,I'm not exposed to it everyday.,because
14937_1,Racism flourishes into hate.,It is what we see now in the world.,and
9052_2,I cannot figure out.,Event happens.,so
10963_1,I grew up in a very diverse neighborhood. ,My thoughts are almost opposite of yours. ,and
42746_3,People in the USA generally view terrorist groups like the Taliban as Muslim.,They view ISIS as being Muslim.,and
19368_1,I could clearly see.,They thought she was Indian.,Nan
14349_4,I would make six figures.,", even though that would be nice.",because
31676_1,These are just a few of christian extremist groups we have  that, we never say Christianity is a violent religion.,Nan
28020_1,You can find evil things in every human being that,you can  find great things in everyone.,and
38434_4,He said how he was filled with hatred.,He said you can't stay that way forever.,Nan
29866_1,There is this sub-conscious notion that many religious people have about that,they believe in that their beliefs are the right beliefs.,and
29289_1,Who never get a chance to see the people,Which people are just like this,Nan
29581_2,I like the way phone can be used in class,it is a huge class,and
7803_1,I am shocked that this is not taught in schools earlier.,I believe that it should be taught in schools earlier.,and
36560_1,But I think the way Bassim looks at it.,He knows God is in control.,Nan
32903_2,I have had Muslims go to my school who were born  here.,I recognize they are nice people.,and
42428_3,His religion encourages him to forgive.,That is exactly what he did.,and
29921_1,Certain situations exist which are of a certain type.,Situations exist containing questions which are unanswered.,Nan
22908_1,They do not realize how important it is to be equals.,They don't realize how that is the way that the majority are progressing.,and
19108_3,He talked about how he didn't know much about the Afghan people.,He only knew that they were raised in war.,Nan
32219_1,This is due to the way people are raised in the United States.,This is due to the way people are educated in the United States.,and
26719_1,Basim said that he does not hate America.,He knew many good Americans.,because
32633_1,It's easy to hide away from the news.,It's easy to pretend like nothing is happening.,and
15522_4,It was interesting to see the entire class react.,The class reacted to their ethnicity.,Nan
29253_2,I am a science major,I am not very well versed in politics not wanting to admit this,and
37812_1,He lost his home. ,He lost the people who meant the world to him. ,and
42178_1,Perhaps it's the constraints.,They teach a religion's followers discipline.,and
33243_1,I often just make bold assumptions about what is going on around the world.,I need to learn to be more attentive to what is happening.,and
25012_1,The news has statistics.,They have numbers about the war that make the situation seem more impersonal.,so
30491_1,Soc 119 has taught me to really take a step back.,It has made me realize these people aren't really crazy or anything.,and
42628_2,"Living a nice life with kids, a wife.",One died in a bombing.,and
11738_2,Of course I asked him why he was curious.,He told me that he studied culture and the characteristics of humans and their ancestors.,and
11534_2,We can start weaning out extreme racial groups.,We can begin to make non-whites feel at home in our shared country.,and
40083_1,Basim took us through his emotions when dealing with the tragedy.,Basim went on to explain why he doesnt hate American people.,and
40315_1,That shows the kind of person he is.,He represents many other people just like him.,and
32932_4, I have an obligation to know who is running my nation what my nation's affairs, look like both nationally  internationally.,and
41418_3,He can forgive a country killing the love of his life.,He can forgive a country killing his precious daughter.,and
42346_1,His religion teaches him not to hate and forgive.,That is what he strictly follows.,and
20222_1,"With this in mind, it is important to recognize all individuals have different cultural upbringings.",We should be aware of their customs to try to follow them as best as we can.,and
42638_1,We cannot forget the people (citizens).,It's their country. ,because
22485_1,My parents decided to raise me and my sisters in the U.S. instead of Ireland.,Schools in Ireland are run by the Church.,because
33386_1,Every war has a reason.,", most of them relate to interest, like power, money, resources.",and
33652_1,It is extremely difficult to follow everything the Bible has set out for us.,It is extremely difficult to follow everything other religious writings have set out for us.,because
35143_1,I can't imagine how much they suffer.,I don't know how to live a life after all these things happened.,and
26560_2,Professor Sam said it is very ridiculous how people make decisions.,Their decisions are based on the law.,and
26749_3,You were not particularly religious.,American being centered on a specific religion doesn't sit right with you.,and
19483_1,I agree with you.,People don't truly know the impact of war.,Nan
35314_2,That allowed him to overcome the stereotype our government can create.,Sometimes that we like to go where we are not welcomed.,and
21816_1,Advertisement affects other religions' opinions.,It affects the way they interpret the laws and their way of living.,and
37060_1,Basim could have certainly turned into an angry person who only wanted revenge.,The fact that he didnt when he had every right to shows so much strength of his character.,and
11807_1,I think that sets a uncomfortable negative situation.,I don't think the person asking has bad intentions.,because
29993_1,I found this very interesting,"one of the main point of Sam's focus is about the use of bible to justify all actions, morals, and beliefs by christianity",because
34720_5,the Soc 119 class.," his response doesnt change, it isbimportant that each class hears what he feels.",and
31437_1,Sam gave two reasons race is very important in America.,"Currently happening is the longest lasting, most extensive genocide in history against Native Americans.",and
39178_2,He states that he has lived in America.,Every individual he has met has been kind.,and
22087_2,Rafi was changed in the aspect that risking his life was worth helping others.,Bassim was changed by how forgiving he was.,and
36552_2,He lost his home to a bombing.,He lost his wife to a bombing.,and
40942_1,"This is key in this class, teaching 750 students ideas of race and ethics. ",The students must understand how to see past differences in others. ,because
23606_1,War really does dehumanize people.,"We think of them as the enemy, often grouping innocent civilians in with that title.",Nan
39662_1,You're supposed to judge people individually.,Off of their character.,Nan
35948_1,He opens up by saying that we can talk about race.,He says that we can talk about diversity.,and
24479_6,I think it's excessively strict.,That's why not many people follow it strictly. ,and
10880_1,We enslaved their people.,We clearly crippled their ability to progress.,and
36846_1,It has taken me a while to adjust to the diversity we are lucky to have here.,I strongly believe this course is helping me adjust.,and
26094_2,The fact their lives are desensitized is cruel.,The fact their lives are desensitized is unjust.,Nan
37918_5,It shows that Americans aren't evil. ,It shows that Americans aren't mean.,and
33588_3,Move on from terrible tragedy., Than a person who doesnt really have faith in any religion.,and
16367_2,They asked how I was doing.,They told me to have a good day.,and
32747_3,These experiences allowed him to keep an open mind about people from the other side of the war.,Deep inside we are all humans.,and
22194_2,I went to catholic school my whole life.,I have many different lessons from the Bible drilled into my head.,so
14186_2,That's where a large portion of black Americans live.,Still nowhere will ever have hockey as popular as it is in Canada. ,and
20124_1,I gained a plethora of knowledge on the topic.,I completely changed my base outlook on war.,and
27837_1,The majority of them claim race is not a problem.,The majority of them are choosing not to speak about it.,because
38291_3,he did think about family  that have been influenced by his strength.,they have been influenced by his understanding.,and
41711_3,Everyone in America is very focused on being the greatest country in the world.,Everyone in America is focused on being the greatest country in the world to the point that they are clearly ignoring something.,Nan
29909_2,which of how eye opening it is that,whcih many people are hospitable generous,and
14508_1,After watching the end result. ,Seeing who actually belongs together in terms of origin. ,Nan
11585_4,It's something that a person holds a lot of pride towards. ," and also, there will most likely always be some sort of tension in races because of the Native American genocide and the slave trade in America.",and
40181_2,Students heard Dr. Richards talk about the world.,Dr. Richards opened up student's eyes.,and
12015_1,I didn't grow up in a super-religious family.,I never really thought about the creation of the world either.,so
27936_2, he is coming back to alot of memories., it hurts him.,and
35940_3,We try to end the division between us.,We wouldn't want to kill each other.,and
21493_1,I could say I'm not attracted to him.,I don't want to date him.,so
10531_2,Everyone voices their opinion on the events.,It always boils down to people picking a side and refusing to consider the situation from another perspective.,because
37852_1,This struck a chord with me.,I think it speaks to how we need to be more open minded.,and
41588_1,He said thats what his religion taught him.,He said that's how he will live.,and
27987_2,it continues to be used a way to justify hatred.,we see with hate groups that militant groups like.,and
41725_2,He could have decided to hate America forever.,He finds solace in our country's people.,and
41438_3,"People just fight, get jealous, whatever else happens.",It just divides people.,and
33420_1,His religion tells him to forgive.,He always uses his religion as a life guide.,and
26692_2,I've never gotten past the book of Genesis.,The Old Testament bored me. ,because
16423_6,They've all been through the same things., and all they have witnessed.,and

42509_4,analyzing alternate views., back home the chance to do that was never even given to me.,because
24263_1,It is common of us to feel mostly safe in our neighborhood area.,It is hard to understand how someone in another country could feel the total opposite.,and
37486_5,I have heard them before. ,I have felt them. ,because
42210_2,She felt more free.,More comfortable.,and
19667_2,They have a really nice shopping mall in the area.,"It seems silly, considering Afghan people are humans.",so
26038_1,I thought of pictures I had seen in newspapers.,I thought of what I had seen on TV.,and
14237_1,People have such different experiences all over the world.,It would be nearly impossible to have one single accent around the world.,Nan
20293_1,They can protect us.,They can travel to various locations to protect the lives of others.,and

31049_1,Sam talks about how we are fish.,We have not left our waters.,and
15433_1,This ensures a good and stable life.,That includes myself.,and
10042_1,I think religion is great.,It's a necessary part of most people's lives.,and
41398_1,Wahabism is a school of Islam.,Salafism is a school of Islam.,and
39308_1,This goes back to the idea you mentioned about being fair., try to gain full knowledge of what is really going on without making rash assumptions.,and
23479_1,"They are people with jobs, families, and hopes.",They want peace.,and
42512_2, a double edged sword it hurts the person who holds it., a double edged sword does not hurts the person that they are angry at.,and
23620_1,Rafi's family deserves to live in happiness and safety.,Rafi's wife doesnt have to worry about whether he will be coming back home that night or not.,and
25668_1,You can't force ways to live life.,There are so many different religions you can be a part of!,because
11078_1,Some members of my family consider themselves to be very religious.,I have been around people like this my whole life.,so
34860_1,Maybe there's a correlation behind that.,I can't judge this trend off of just Basim and me.,Nan
25008_1,"If your country is involved in a war, then it is easy to forget that real people are dying every day.",It is not the first thing on your mind when you wake up.,because
32824_3," separation of church state, I think this is something they did very ","intentionally good reason, we shouldnt forget this.",and
34735_1,"As large of a book the bible is, its crazy to me that it has such an impact on modern day issues.",Modern day issues aren't even mentioned in it.,and
42377_1,I feel like it could be one step closer to making our nation.,I feel like it could be one step closer to making the world a more peaceful.,and
33048_3,People have a lot to learn from Bassim.,People have a lot to learn from Bassim's life.,and
42445_5,You go out.,You explore.,and
36101_1,It's great that Basim is able to understand.,The main problem is not with our people.,Nan
34306_1,I agree it is very heartbreaking.,We can just go into someone else's country to destroy lives like that.,and
28371_1,The lessons are so valuable.,They are not to be taken at face value.,Nan
22334_2,It was extremely inspirational.,It makes me want to strive to be a more forgiving person.,and
31663_3,He lost everything because of an accidental bombing by the United States.,I do not understand how he was able to forgive and move on.,Nan
39094_8,"My distant family, even relatives have told me many horror stories of bombings, soldiers just appearing in their front yard. ","They said the soldiers would just appear on the way to school, even in the places that they worship.",and

36766_2,People come from different backgrounds. ,People come from different cultures. ,and
38339_1,I find this class fascinating.,We are able to talk to people from across the world about issues outside of the United States.,because
40432_1,I personally loved the stories that Basim shared.,I loved the personal reactions he presented to us.,and
31855_4,"In of the Quran, we need to realize that Christians act in the same","way that following two completely opposite religions,",and
29258_1,"By keeping the two separate, I feel like we can keep all parties that ","pleased  by doing so, people can  should be able to live their lives the way they wan",because

15186_1,Specialists and analysts from both sides could show how they get to their conclusions.,They could show how a belief is so prevalent in a group.,Nan
13798_3,The majority of students at my school were African American they were my friends.,Growing up there were never really any problems that occurred due to race.,because
42390_2,We are all similar.,We should look at uniting our species.,so

42071_3,I really did not know any of the information that he was talking about, I learned a lot of new information.,because
33295_2,it may be very different than the way of life in the United States there are," very basic similarities that all humans share,  we should understand",and
41575_1,I think that Basims advice is a really important aspect to focus on.,We should all make an effort to educate ourselves about what is happening to our world as a whole.,because
36818_4,It is inspiring to see someone who has be personally affected by America's War on Terror,Have faith in the individual people in the United States.,so
35931_1,This is why we have the Constitution of the United States.,I believe that is what should justify the securement of liberty.,because
10651_1,"He explained how just a couple of months ago, India apologized for the anti-Sikh riots in the past.",The way they were able to come to terms with that is why racism isn't as much of a problem in countries like that. ,and
42402_3,They should put themselves in someone else's shoes. ,They would understand that what we're doing is eternally wrong. ,and
41187_6,This is from the conversation with Bassim. ,This interaction is key to getting Americans to better understand. ,and
40185_2,The people likely do not doubt this at all. ,All that we can do is keep going with the same approach we have been using. ,and

7847_4,Linking that with their ancestry gives us a tool to better understand the slight differences among us.,The reason why we have them to begin with.,and
32539_2,Our thoughts are evolving.,Our ideas are evolving.,so
23580_1,I am now aware of the teachings of the Sharia Law.,This way if people look on this negatively.,because
33667_1,Men in the middle east are usually portrayed by the US to be uncaring and not loving to their wives.,It was eye opening for me to here,so
23088_1,We are only shown so much of what is actually going on.,"I think that when we hear about the number of deaths happening because of war, we never know how many people and families are actually being affected.",so

15099_2,Race is a very interesting topic to discuss.,It is something.,Nan
14525_1,They have a negative impact to people.,They spread wrong ideas that should never be accepted.,and
35858_5,"she must wait a certain number of years prior to being allowed to do that,",the same goes for in Afghanistan (4 years),and
24923_5,Others see it a threat.,They have not taken time to understand it.,because
9587_3,They helped me discover who I am.,they raised my curiosity to even newer levels that I didnt think were possible of existing.,and
34055_1,We go through elementary school with an education on pointless geography.,We go through junior high school with an education on pointless geography,and
16018_1,"Therefore, I have always had this picture in my head.",I though of it being nothing but a war zone.,Nan
12023_1,Due to the fact that they have hate.,Maybe they are intimidated.,and
41961_4,he can go back to what used to be his home.,Now it isn't.,and
34583_2,I had no idea  what happened to Basims family.,I had no idea  what probably thousands of other families,and
29565_1,"who like you, I  associate Afghan with negative connotations simply from",what I have been exposed to on the internet  on television.,because
32392_1,Thinking about others doesnt make you any money which might be ,why we are never taught in a school setting to do  elementary middle school.,so
11581_1,The United States used these ideals to dehumanize people.,It made them seem less than an actual human being.,and
38555_1,If I were him I would hate the U.S. for all that pain.,I don't know if I would be able to forgive.,and
15525_1,I realized something.,I think I know about people.,Nan
40060_1,To many muslims sharia could mean applying justice.,to the regressive ultra-conservative it could mean that they have to apply what god demands them to apply.,and

29624_2,Caucasians don't play hockey because they are good at it,people pursue sports they desire due to their passions and desire to succeed in it,because
9702_1,Where you grow up has such huge impact on all of these aspects.,How you grow up has such huge impact on all of these aspects.,and
10813_1,This was mostly through people being very determined to date only within their race.,It was due to a multitude of reasons.,so
12058_1,This racial hierarchy puts people who identify with the label White at the top.,People who identify with the label Black are at the bottom.,and
23313_1,War affects real people.,It ruins real places and devastates real families.,Nan
9096_1,I definitely agree with your statement.,"You truly do not know a place, the people, culture/ customs prior to being immersed in it.",and
31772_1,It made me realize that our countries really are not that different.,we all want to just live our lives safely.,and
38665_2,That says a lot about his character.,I know a lot of people who after 9 11 blamed the entire middle east.,because
28690_3,The media portray areas of Afghanistan.,The areas of Afghanistan are inhabitable due to war.,and
29583_1,Other than that I like that our Soc 119 thought outside the box.,said screw tradition class rules.,and
39956_3,"Despite the ambiguity, this year's classes led me to ask questions.",I learned many things this year.,so
10153_1,Race should not be put in the same category as religion,Race should not be put in the same category as politics.,and

40440_2,What happened to his family.,The strength he possessed talking about it was incredible.,and
41975_1,He said he lived here for eight or so years.,He was always being respected by other American citizens.,Nan
16012_1,"They want to help their people, like Raffi's partner.",They die trying to make their country a better place.,because
15898_1,Ignoring the tensions won't do anything.,It won't push anything forward.,Nan
13035_1,Sam pointed out a few features.,He explained.,Nan
22483_2,Actually they are very strong.,There are so many people like Rafi that are pushing every single day to eradicate the oppression that they have been living under.,and
8603_1,Fighting about the past won't make the future any better.,The best way to move forward is by learning from past mistakes.,and

30238_2,I think even the word privilege is an exaggeration,my parents didn't face the struggles that a black person would face in America,because
34706_3,I didn't separate the two.,I never thought about it thoroughly.,because
28839_2,the rules are written in the Sharia.,The rules written in the Bible are religious.,and
12759_1,"What sport a child chooses to specialize in depends on their interest, skill, the popularity of the sport and in some cases economic ability to pay for said sport.",This includes if it is offered at their school.,Nan

30532_2,To take away this label would take away a big part of their culture.,Religion has its roots deep in history.,and
30498_1,I start thinking about the point of this class.,"I begin to think that we may have something that works here,",and
39525_1,There is a similar idea of the sociological perspective.,It is the idea that you take on another person's perspective of life.,and
21528_1,I also think it was a good idea to aim this at college students.,"Alcohol, for example, is one of the many prevalent things found on college campuses.",because
27227_3,Our society has matured.,Our society has advanced.,and
27548_1,This discussion was interesting.,It is prevalent in most every persons life.,and
23335_2, I think we needed this class.,It shows us how this war affects peoples everyday lives.,and
22288_1,I agree with you.,It is wrong the way Americans categorize Afghani people these days.,Nan
31209_1,The only aspect of Afghanistan that I still don't understand is why it is still at war.,Why is it the hub for terrorism since the beginning of time.,and
38000_2,Who are we to judge their beliefs., we don't believe in what they do.,and
12411_1,I feel as though the huge issue of race in the United States is something that I've never questioned or thought about.,I've never known it any other way.,because
20629_1,Innocent people are being killed everyday.,Sam helped us realize in class that its not just the bad guys doing the killing.,and
21268_2,People from America's military are dying.,Everyone dying are real people.,and
12499_1,I learned by talking to people who have been affected by this issue. ,I learned more than through any of my previous years in school.,so
35530_1,"One of my closest friends is Muslim,",I am able to separate the religion from groups of people who claim to be followers of the religion.,because
21224_1,Everyone should understand what their training is used for.,They should understand the good that can come out of it.,and
19306_1,He compares the similarities between Islam and Christianity a certain way.,It really astounded me.,Nan
34714_10,women who show off their bodies do  is they want to.,it should not matter what anyone thinks about it.,so
41774_1,This was well thought out.,The question Ethan asked.,Nan
30238_4,my parents didn't face the struggles that a black person would face in America,hey did work hard to be where they are today,because
40804_1,It is almost unfathomable to even make one step towards forgiving the people and the flag.,They took away your loved ones.,Nan
29485_2,Which people solve racial issues,"Who is everyone were open up talk about them,.",and
33480_2,he doesnt hate American.,he understood the problem.,Nan
33823_1,hat hit me pretty hard.,someone with anger  to his religion.,and
40478_1,I chose this video.,Bassim's strength is incredible.,because
31611_4, I think that far it has been effective in promoting religious freedom.,uniting the people under one set of laws.,and
33597_2,It will all reveal itself.,Pour through the moment that you start expressing your ideas.,and
21379_2,Everyone prospers.,You help others.,because
31941_1,This left an impact on my beliefs., could you imagine how much more peaceful the world would be.,because
12388_1,"On one hand, it shows that we as a country are very diverse.",We are from different areas around the world. ,and
29687_1,A specific group of people do something basic in regards to others.,These people look a others in a certain way.,Nan

36588_1,My dad was an unknown for them.,They assumed the worst about him.,and
38989_3,thats what he did.,eing angry  the rest of his life wouldn't do him any good.,because
36483_5,It was just before this one where Sam shared Basim's story.,I was writing my reply.,and
16340_6,They accept this situation regarding the greater good.,"Rafi is willing to put his life in danger to accomplish peace, harmony.",and
34685_4, learn that he can he needs to fully engulf himself in other cultures., learn first-hand why people are the way they are.,and
42009_3,It going back to the way it was before.,I don't blame him.,and
31321_6,It has nothing to do with me.,It doesn't affect my life.,so
14655_1,"One time, I had to fill out a form.","When I reached the ethnicity check boxes, I couldn't find a box for Middle Eastern.",and
11686_5,Stained by the US enslavement of African people., which started in the 1600s.,and
9548_1,"This topic caught my attention for multiple reasons, but the two biggest were the fact that I follow sports religiously.","And, because I grew up playing lacrosse and football.",Nan
36470_2,We preach freedom.,We take away these things from others.,and
20342_1,This is from watching the news.,This is from only seeing one angle.,and
33080_3,He realized continuing to want to experience that emotion wasnt changing his situation.,it was only consuming.,and
41072_1,The comment the student made really stuck with me.,Sam said during class that people have a phobia of Islamic people.,and
40070_1,I think that is amazing. ,"After such a traumatic event in his life that killed his family members, he is able to move on. ",because
37850_1,I don't know how anyone could function under sharia law.," Like Sam said, its so hard to know how to punish a crime using a small bible written years and years ago.",because
36576_5,He was just sitting next to him. ,The Sargent just figured he was another member of the police force. ,and
30816_1,Both have a central holy figure. ,One holy figure is Jesus. ,and
24919_1,When Rafi tweeted the basic foundations of the Quran for class it could have helped put things into perspective for people.,It could put things into perspective for people confused about the law..,Nan
24015_1,I see amazing architecture on both sides.,I am in a whole new mindset.,and
24793_1,The way I look at it is by comparing the time in which these books were written.,I look at it by comparing the time we live now days.,and
39840_1,Americans were sent over to his house.,they  accidentally bombed his house.,and
38794_2,I try to defend what our GOVERNMENT did to him.," an extremist group, the government of the USA.",and
40519_3,That's especially true when you mentioned that the American bashing should stop.,The discussion of American history should be a lesson for future generations.,and
14920_1,We put people into different categories.,We associate them with certain things.,and
15139_4,The small differences are from people evolving in different climates., and regions of the world.,and
20156_2,Take military actions trying to respect the Afghan culture.,Protecting real people.,and
15720_2,This was his cousins family nickname.,He was darker skinned.,because
34962_1,We practically invade this country at our leisure.,we can gain what we want from the situation.,so
29932_2,I thought this was a good thing to bring upbecause we are all ,"quick to judge something by just what we see,  by actually trying to observe",so
41353_2,The main problem is that the media portrays Iraq as mostly negative. ,The main problem is that the media portrays Afghanistan as mostly negative. ,Nan
33687_2,I didn't feel offended in any way.,I knew it wasn't coming from a bad place.,because
37531_1,I kind of go off my moral beliefs.,I kind of go off what I believe is morally right.,and
11612_1,It showed the reason why where you grow up/ are born has a large impact on who you are.,Over time humans who live in specific areas tend to look the same.,and
10635_2,To perform certain sports.,Than white people do purely because of their genes.,Nan
33139_3,That is where another group split off.,That group is called the Muslims.,and
20648_1,I thought this question was great.,I believe people in America don't really know whats going on in Afghanistan or the Middle East in general.,because
27345_1,"Furthermore, it seems to very easy.",To distance us the long way.,so
21664_1,All religion is peaceful till its not.,All religion can be violent till its not.,and
32176_2,"In hearing Basims story specifically, those casualties become much more real.", Those casualties become much more humanized to us.,and
19393_5,You should find another one from a US paper. ,"shows both sides of the story so you can have a wide, full-scale idea of the conflict.",Nan
22926_1,Islam has taken a lot of bad media coverage in the last decade due the terror attacks.,The war in Afghanistan gave them a bad reputation too.,and
39737_2,It is very hard to hear that people are suffering.,What America is doing.,because
27579_2,There is a war going on in their country.,"They are everyday people, just like us.",because
19614_5,There are times that we must stand back.,try to make the best of our situation.,and
12414_1,This really stood out to me.,It helped make sense of the question.,because
30054_1,We are quick to judge people all the time., the Islamic terrorists are a prime example of that.,so
35797_1,Empathy is something that brings us all together.,It allows for a connection.,and
39520_4,The sources which I got my information.,That is why this class is so important.,and
15467_1,A government that can't acknowledge.,It cant fix their mistakes.,and

39849_4,"we need to start teaching truths, expand our children's knowledge of international relations.","stop spewing lies , taking part in heroification.",and
24245_1,Sam mentioned how the bible and the Quran all share similar theories.,It all leads back to the idea of not judging someone (their religion) without knowing their beliefs and background first.,Nan
9965_3,The Matching Ancestor activity was difficult.,There were several people with mixed ancestry.,because
14070_1,All humans have 99.9% of same genes.,The idea that the white people are more evolved is a great example of White culture.,and
10077_1,We take in what the media portrays.,We don't think twice about how that could be completely wrong.,and
42123_1,We do not really understand something.,We have someone like Dr. Richards speak.,Nan
35079_4,It has the fastest publishing of information about any current event at any given time., I read newspapers.,and
10293_1,Drugs is a huge issue in this country.,I dont think it has to do with the racism issue.,Nan
20693_1,People believe that they are following their religion when they say they hate gay people.,That is what God tells them to do.,because
38216_1,Sam could enlighten the rest of our society.,Encourage people to step outside their comfort zone.,and
37315_4," I shouldnt take things, granted.",I could lose everything  in a second.,and
31642_1,Bassim said he lived with Americans.,Bassim had vacations with Americans.,and
36799_1,His problem is with the government.,That's completely understandable,and
41250_7,Sharia law is based on the Quran.,Sharia law being based on the Quran makes it so that it can have different interpretations.,and
40456_2,While listening to Basim talk,What happened to his family and friends.,Nan
12238_1,It takes practice.,It takes a lot of intense training to build your endurance up.,and
38167_1,We learned about what happened to Basims family.,We thought that he would hate the United States.,because
40657_3,the casualty numbers are usually high.,casualty numbers are made up of people we do not know personally.,because
33573_3,They say these people are very nice.,A lot of the people from the middle east are this way.,and
26691_2,They teach you how to live your life.,You can interpret it for yourself.,and
29910_3,I feel the America is unlike this., it is shocking that these people can be welcoming to anyone,so
15679_1,This unconsciously leads them to be seen as racist.,This is even though that is not the case.,Nan
22733_1,I would be honored to be a part of this program/ many others like it.,This would start our way into a better future.,and
35169_2,resilience.,gave me insight.,and
36093_3,It made me realize that not as many people as I thought are THAT offended by what other people wear.,Sometimes they even think the clothes you have on are cute.,and
35179_1,In general whites are always on top.,we have used slave labor in many different means throughout history.,so
27077_2,You say people have different interpretations of the Bible.,Stereotyping people within a certain religion is unfair.,and
23093_1,"This was surprising is because everyone has a picture in their head of what they think the Taliban, or terrorists in general look like.",This is from all the terrible things we hear on the news.,so
15613_3,They want to play at the collegiate level.,They will do all they can.,and
23875_1,Love takes many different forms.,I support every one.,and
23208_1,It was a tragic incident.,It did not need to happen.,Nan

13274_1,Most people like me make assumptions where people are from due to their accent.,Sometimes I can't even figure it out.,and

30667_2,My religion is a reason I am reluctant to talk about certain issues that are discussed in class.,I feel like I might say the wrong thing.,because
31899_1,He talked about how he deals with it today.,How it has impacted him as a person.,and
41657_5,"They asked does he feel angry, the feeling is that it would take a long time to get over this event.","No matter what he stayed calm, peaceful through it all. ",and
11502_2,In America we are not allowed to call black people that name.,It has a bad connotation.,because

38396_2,Many people are taught negative ways to think about other people without any reason.,Many people are taught negative ways to think about how other people look.,and

12450_1,He is partially white.,He is partially black.,and
33781_6,it really made me think about how people see things differently.,depending on where theyre from how theyre raised.,so
16470_1,The best solution for this would be for people to be more open.,They should make an effort to get to know other people who don't necessarily look like them or live where they do.,and
31078_3,It helped me see how I hold the views of American way of life as the best.,It helped me see how I hold the views of Christianity as the standard everyone would want.,and
41840_1,It was sad. ,He said he doesn't have hope things will change in Irbil Mosul.,Nan
33920_1,"As a result of this upbringing, in my family some women love to wear hijabs.",Other women never wear them.,and

41756_1,He and the other people had their houses destroyed.,They deserve so much more.,Nan
25414_1,He brought it up in class.,It is important we are called out on our hypocrisy.,because
40910_3,I realized his family is no different than my own.,That could be me in another life.,and
9031_3,Things that we cannot help.,It was part of our ancestry.,because
39799_2,This class has made me look more closely at the news.,This class has made me look more closely at things happening around the world.,and
40536_1,Not only did we kill Basim's family.,Destroy all his belongings.,and
41640_3,"They focus on its past, and how we came to be.",There's no focus on other countries.,and
37072_1,"To forgive a country, a government as a whole is something that takes a lot of effort. ",It isn’t always accomplished. ,and
37917_3,That's when he realized.,He had to let it go.,and
24697_1,You must recognize something.,Claim the same of your own religion.,and
37293_2,Ive got a pretty good relationship with my sister. ,I can say I love just as Bassim proclaimed about his family in class. ,and
41193_4,That is something I don't think many Americans would be able to do in that sense. ,or any people would be able to do in that sense.,and
34508_3, The media wants to portray our country as the best.,We do no wrong. ,because
32324_1,I want to do something now.,I now want to widen my options by studying different religions.,and
35868_2,He lost everything.,He was able to find his spark.,and
38227_3,I learned his dear wife passed away during the war.,His young daughter passed away during the war.,and
20574_1,I believe that this happens due to religion.,Religion tends to attend to people's specific needs.,because

33984_1,I really respect how Basim was able to follow his religion that,closely through this terrible time  well.,so
30765_1,People say they are completely devout to Christianity.,"I'm sure devout Christians have sinned,",so
24196_5,He was addressing the hypocrisy that exists.,"Addressing people, usually Christians, who label Muslim teachings being radical, being violent.",Nan
21024_1,I find it astonishing how we don't treat all the terror attacks the same.,they are done for one purpose: to impose fear.,because

36040_1,It is really interesting to hear his thoughts.,It is inspiring how he carries on in his life without hate for the United States.,and
23390_1,This class was a real eye-opener.,We really don't know what it's like to be a civilian in a place where war is going on.,because

26554_1,They may think I'm not gay,They God hates gays,and
21397_3,I only wish it went into more detail.,I only wish it had less blanket statements.,Nan

26525_2,it was super confusing for a seven years old,people act like the bible has all the answer,because

39285_2,The class was enjoyable to sit through.,The students started repeating themselves.,and
35379_1,I understand his faith helped him grow into a better person.,His faith helped him not to be angry.,and
26936_1,I decide on this one.,My friend sitting in my row admitted to being the only fornicator in the room of nearly 700 college students.,because
27571_2,Why can we not drop a bomb where all of the militants are.,Be done with the war.,and
28376_1,It took a while to realize.,Conservative religious views influenced the government so much.,Nan
31863_2,The US is being selfish.,The US is not thinking about what other people are going through.,and
21830_2,I would not have guessed.,The Afghan people would be so kind and welcoming.,because
20034_3,They showed me actual photos from Afghanistan.,The photos show well-constructed homes along with beautiful glass shopping malls.,Nan
22554_1,But I had seen the beauty of Tunisia before this war broke out.,It really broke my heart (especially when comparing it to Tunisia today).,and
24968_1,Political leaders were showing the people that it is ok to join together. ,It is okay to vote for a common good.,and
28133_1,U.S and Soviet were at cold war in the 80s,cold war means no direct war threat,Nan
29430_1,Religion is changing vastly across the nation.,we are seeing many more people joining our family.,and

32250_1,Something that traumatic can affect a person for the rest of their lives.,He will always carry that pain with him.,and
36287_1,This story is really inspiring.,With all the issues facing our country today forgiveness is not really talked about enough.,because
40562_1,He went through a trial of faith.,He came out with a stronger faith.,and
34218_1,The actions of one person does not represent an entire religion.,The actions of one person does not represent an entire ethnicity group.,Nan
36818_3,With the general view of the Middle East  by Americans.,It is inspiring to see someone who has be personally affected by America's War on Terror,so
39910_2,I believe.,We would do a lot of things so much differently.,Nan
27131_2,We were shown that Christians fixate.,They believe homosexuals are not going to heaven based on the bible.,Nan
42541_1,We have these firm beliefs in our head.,We leave little room for different ideas.,and
31575_2,Another key point that you brought up is that taking reading literally causes discrimination., by living through these teaching we are not viewing everyone equal humans .,so
15311_2,It takes a lot to answer a question in front of a class of 700 people.,It is much harder if you are constantly in fear of how people will react.,and
19379_1,You wrote a compellling response.,I identified with many statements you made.,and
38934_5,We should be grateful., There is always someone out there who has it worst.,because
26650_3,It happens constantly.,It doesn't make it right.,and
20023_1,The parents want to raise you with good habits and values that you will be proud of.,you may be able to understand that all the seemly pointless school works were to help you succeed.,and
38173_1,"I am proud of Basim for staying true to himself, his family, his friends (including his American friends).","Basim is true to his religion after the horrific, devastating life event.",and
20286_1,The bible says god will completely forgot about the sins you have committed if you truly repent.,God will forget the sins you committed sorry for what you have done.,and
21062_2,At least it is not us is a selfish and dangerous mentality.,I really don't want to have that mentality any longer.,and
20643_1,This statement is very weighty and used often in forms of hate.,"No one ever talks about the rest of the passage, though.",Nan
39067_1,Should we not be aware of these things?,When they happen?,Nan

35050_1,what people tend to forget about.,the native Americans were treated.,Nan
32641_1,Islamophobia in this country is real.,It's because a lot of people have never met someone of the Muslim faith.,and
39466_1,I had many misconceptions about the reasons they wear them.,I had many misconceptions about the reasons they wear them.,so
33998_8,was the fact that the reason that Bassim was able to be  kind  forgiving ,"willing to talk to our class, was  of his faith.",so
8768_1,My high school was small.,There were probably about 6 people in my graduating class that were not white.,and
31171_4,It does boggle our mind how these people could interpret violence out of a book pertaining to God.,We practice faith by sitting in a circle praying.,and
39104_1,People have generalized Muslims based off of the media.,People have generalized groups of people ,and
38619_3,war is sad topic to hear about.,I feel that we  Americans must learn to get past that.,and
10641_1,I definitely think that there are stereotypes.,I definitely think that there are generalizations relating to race in nearly everything we do.,and
19837_4,I am okay with that.,I am sad for Afghan and other families around the world.,so
37620_2,I assume that someone comes from a different culture.,They think they have it out.,because
41381_1,We overlook the wrong doing within our religion. ,We overlook the wrongdoing of those who follow Christianity. ,and
41846_3,people prohibited all citizens from doing certain things.,I would not know how to react.,and
30617_2,I'm very lucky.,It is hard to relate to his story.,so
40283_1,This tells you that the world around us is constantly evolving.,That means we can talk about various issues and topics each year.,so
27310_1,Sometimes there are terrible things going on.,Almost no one hears about the terrible things.,and
36825_1,I think that its used as a guideline.,All of them were written so many years ago.,and
29015_1, I agree this was eye-opening.,The truth of the matter is that religion has been used to manipulate many situations,and
15056_1,I honestly never really gave much thought to what others believed in.,After hearing this lecture I really started to question it.,Nan
9574_1,In the fifth grade my social studies teacher asked me where my family was from.,She asked this because of my last name.,Nan
30503_1,"The Quran however, was seen to fail  of its sick that", twisted view towards the world human rights.,because
35496_2,It was so helpful to get hear from someone who could teach us.,We can hopefully bring a change.,and
35438_1,What I found was very inspirational about Basims conversation.,He said that he was not angry with the United States citizens.,and
11134_1,"In America, our culture tries to create perfection.","At times, it seems as if people are rewarded for changing themselves artificially to achieve beauty.",and
37006_1,I thought that America was the best country in the world.,I thought that the government was messy.,and
29582_3, it's many different platforms the possibilities are endless., The only thing that I dislike is the internet gangsters  people who will talk shit on the internet.,so
38113_1,"His wife, daughter, brother, house, car, were all taken away from him.",He will never be able to get it back.,and
28051_5,I believe that the bible is old.,Due to the advancements in society that it is interpreted differently.,so
38641_2,Empathy can be a complicated concept.,It is something that we constantly need to be learning from.,and
33084_3,Being angry isnt worth it., The goal we want is logistically unachievable or illegal.,because
41726_2,Bassim was able to forgive Americans .,he lost his family members at the hands of our government.,and
37815_2,I heard his words.,I put faces to the names of his family.,and
23134_2,Things have happened.,People also believe in their religion.,and
32689_2,I liked how he said he couldn't be mad at Americans.,He has lived in America.,because
9212_1,People like Rafi risk their lives everyday so the bag guys don't prevail.,I think it's important that we remember there are many people in the country who do the same thing.,so
32494_1,"America was founded on laws related to religious beliefs,",creating a nation of freedom that is only acceptable,and
11585_2,"At the same time, it's someone's culture.",It's something that a person holds a lot of pride towards. ,and
40194_3,That they may one day go off the deep end.,Attacking you in some way due to your religious views.,and
14866_1,We want to live life to the fullest.,how you believe the world was created should not change ones opinion.,so
11686_4,It has stained this countrys integrity.,Stained by the US enslavement of African people.,Nan
35526_7,you are able to see them in a new light.,see them more as people.,and
7847_3,Linking that with their ancestry gives us a tool to better understand the slight differences among us.,The reason why we have them to begin with.,and
32017_3,Basim transformed his anger into motivation to fight for peace.,Basim transformed his anger into motivation to work with foreign affairs.,and
36654_3,They have different morals.,They have different ideals.,and
28831_3,Raffi lost almost everything he had.,Raffi keeps that mentality of making the world a better place.,and
31587_1," time changes, innovation increases, education is expanded.", individuals are able to expand knowledge on not only subjects in school.,and
29576_5, many people in the world that are filled with such hate  anyone that, does something  small  dressing differently than they do.,so
30313_2,Everyone is so bias., Christians have the same thing going on.,because
23982_2,A war is currently taking place there.,They aren't even be able to understand a comfortable and safe life.,Nan

38207_2,Not for a long while., I dont know how I would move on from an event like that.,and
42572_2,The world we live in is unfair.,It should be put to a stop.,and
11652_1,Someone's genetic makeup has nothing to do with anything.,Someone's genetic makeup has to do with what kind of ancestry they have. ,Nan
22387_1,"I also thought it was very interesting that Maziar said that everyone, when he traveled to Iran, was extremely welcoming.",Everyone taught him many things about their culture and what they believe.,Nan
40336_5,You can prode them as to their interpretation of an event.,That does not mean you can understand the event in its entirety.,Nan
23000_1,The world is such a scary place.,"We need to do all we can to make it a more peaceful, safe place.",and
10083_1,I think that fundamentally the most important way of learning is to challenge yourself to different points of view.,Don't close yourself in echo-chambers that will support your initial position.,Nan
31308_1,There's one thing that struck me the most.,Why the USA offered very little in reparations to Basim.,so
33775_4,I thought some technical issue occurred with the projector.,Mr. Bassim appeared live on our projector.,and
32813_1,I just think it teaches things that cant be taught through a textbook.,These things aren't being taught in other classes.,and
32239_1,I believe they were oppressed.,I know nothing about the Islam faith and culture.,because
37229_2,war affects people.,we do not witness war every day.,and
36122_2,I learned more about someone's life in a different country.,We always seemed to find commonalities.,and
21392_1,The Lieutenant Colonel explained to the class that it is not constant fighting.,He was often times engaging in politics with the people of the opposing country whether they are civilians or military leaders.,and
14592_3,we all look different.,some people look the same.,and
42739_2,Staying angry does not bring the people we love back. ,Staying angry does not punish the people who took our loved ones from us.,and
39995_6,Being able to understand other religions.,Stereotyped as dangerous.,and
10282_1,"Throughout school, we have always been taught about slavery.",We truly never addressed the issue at hand.,and
35312_1,It takes such a peaceful person like Bassim.,Hatred and revenge do more damage than they do good.,Nan
11920_2,My mom she is a Buddhist.,"Mom tells me that I should find something to hold on to, to have something in faith.",and
42062_3,I would find it extremely hard to forgive anyone.,For that I look up to Bassim.,and
39764_3,It played out in my mind how the future could possibly be like.,Especially is something unexpected and tragic happened to me.,so
30811_2,There needs to be more conversation going on.,People will start realizing the truth.,so
19051_1,This isn't a factor that is solely specific to a certain subject.,The subject in question is the Global War on Terror.,and
20054_1,I am not defending the other side of a war by any means.,It struck me during class that even military personnel can have a false pretense of the other side in a war.,Nan
32325_1,It is an interesting comparison to make  it is,new to more people than ,because
9434_1,I liked how Sam made a point.,"When he looks at a person's physical features, he sees his or her ancestors.",Nan
22592_1,The idea that they answer is clear to some and not to others is also interesting to me.,It is true in just how you interpret the bible and the words.,because

36058_3,Basim went through a lot.,The military's actions were cruel.,and
36144_3,We see pictures of the beautiful family he lost.,The stories become real.,and
39283_4,"think about real history, remember that whites actually made 650,000 on average household","blacks made under 100,000.",and

37080_1,I think this is important idea.,having a body of knowledge about somethings might prevent us to think farther and understanding other ideas.,because

25532_4,We think they are a certain way.,and form an opinion about them before we try and even understand them.,Nan
28683_1,This is a reasonable thing to do.,It is impossible to follow every part of the bible.,because

29645_5, it helps us to become more culturally aware.,it can diminish some of the stereotypes.,because

41043_3,Could not possibly have the same foreign policy.,They had such different goals politically.,because
12248_1,I suppose his target audience was the alt-right.,It was not a woman of color.,and
35751_5,They offer a small sum of $1500 to compensate.,It seems unbearable to forgive.,and

40194_4,That they may one day go off the deep end.,Attacking you in some way due to your religious views.,because
32851_1,My opinion is very vague.,My opinion is very objective.,and

23218_1,I thought it was really important for Sam to have Rafi speak.,It really puts things into perspective.,because

31923_2,Someone asked Basim how can he forgive such terrible actions.,Terrible things were done to Basim.,Nan
42537_1,The class goal was to step into another person's shoes.,It was to experience life from their point of view.,and
40985_2,We put it to the back of our mind.,We don't know these people.,because
19223_1,We do not talk about race too much.,We talk not nearly enough.,and
41431_4,It's necessary to flip the script.,It's necessary to put yourself at the other end of the discussion.,and

31226_3,Sam drew on.,It got redundant. ,and
40640_1,Children don't often hear about the atrocities.,Children don't often hear the horrifying stories.,and
30232_5, the Bible says that's wrong., those same Christians have most likely not been perfect themselves.,because
27858_1,They ruined everything that he had,they did not have the decency to give him enough money for buying a new home,and

42452_3,They have not been in them before.,They start to see the difference.,and
25134_1,They are affected by war.,This cannot continue to be unnoticed.,and
27035_1,Dr richard ask the question in the video,The reason for his putting all efforts with good works for woman and girl in Afghanistan despite many death threats,so
23096_1,It wasn't just this story that showed me that.,That whole class was a real eye opener.,and
7648_1,I picked this video.,I never knew humans are 99.9% the same.,because

24239_1,Let alone raising a family in the middle of one.,It's not a worry I will have for my children.,because

38458_4,It allows you to be open minded.,It allows you to see the world from more than just one perspective.,and
33394_1,"Many years ago, his wife daughter were killed in a ",miscalculated  bombing by the American military.,and
37537_1,We see events like a mass school shootings. ,These white kids who do this are religious. ,and
14077_1,I grew up in a football household.,The culture I was raised in was very football oriented.,so
27625_4,People try to justify evils such as slavery and racism based upon the Bible,They are not reading it in context.,because
11491_1,He compared African Americans. ,He showed the lecture hall why even white people across the world are nowhere near similar besides their skin. ,and
24837_1,Sam talked about Christian sharia.,He talked about how some people use certain parts of the Bible to make their point valid.,and
33792_5, this man is far from us.,you have found a way to connect.,so
26857_3,Laws may push certain points like how being gay is immoral.,Christian lawmakers ignore teaching that Jesus loves all people. ,and
36504_1,Basim's answer was that nothing has changed.,Every president says that they will change things.,and
15245_2,They don't want to taint their bloodline.,The list goes on.,and
30378_3,The US divorce rate is higher than Afghanistan.,I think this is due to the fact that divorce is much easier in America.,because
42077_1,I wrote about this specific portion of class last week.,"I, too, think Basim shows a great deal of character in this video.",and
35579_3,"My doctor discovered my medical condition , no one could.",My doctor is a muslim,and
34445_1,Many people do not have this where they are from.,Do not have the opportunity to talk to people.,and
30695_2, the discovery of the Americas was a joyous event., the discovery of the Americas was a positive turning point for humanity overall.,Nan
13738_1,They say that.,They have genuine reason behind their words.,and
11844_1,Neither of these things seems likely to happen on a large scale anytime in the near future.,I guess the majority of us have to be happy just accepting Sam's conclusion that we don't know anything.,so
15856_2,Segregation has come a long way in past years.,One would think we wouldn't have to talk about it anymore.,Nan
33807_2,I think it's our duty to listen to what is happening around us.,I think it's our duty to try our best to give aid.,and
35592_2,"Hopefully, Basim's story resonated with everyone in the class.",It will make people change their outlook on Middle East.,and
31545_2,This part of the lecture is definitely very mind-opening.,I consider myself a Christian.,because
30501_1,"Most of the base agreed that both Christian,", Muslim law could not solely run a government.,and
29139_2,we get when we try to bring up the problems.,got to see how frustrating it can be.,and
25757_1,The only thing that people talk about is that how that country has been a conflict zone.,They do not really discuss the status of the innocent Afghan people.,and
24360_1,They know that there will be conflict.,That it is unavoidable.,and
12329_2,I learned about the racism that exists.,I'm surprised that it's even tolerated in some areas.,so
21940_1,I liked seeing the photographs of him.,Seeing his family really helped me connect to those in Afghanistan.,and
20591_1,I believe it is very important to travel the world.,It is very important to become exposed to different cultures.,so
26819_3,"It showed everyone, in many ways, they are just like us.",There is no reason to hate them.,and
31631_1,I live love., it breaks my heart to see two people spending their lives together.,and
11167_1,That is due to the fact that his family could not afford them.,His family believed that having crooked teeth was not that big of an issue.,and

9553_1,I believe this led to a less diverse group of people to play the sport.,They're ancestors didn't play it.,because

16253_1,I really like what you said.,I like how you discussed LCT Gareys response to the question.,and
36671_3,We’re lying to ourselves if we don't believe the Islamic State is demonizing the West as a whole.,We’re lying to ourselves if we don’t believe the Islamic state is scaring people into action. ,and
35025_3,Basim has good reasoning for why he was able to forgive the U.S,It would be a burden if he hadn't,because
19176_2,The same amount of people that participated in the Civil Rights Movement need to come together.,They need to demand that things change.,and
22599_2,Powerful how much reasoning one book could have on  our lives.,Powerful how much control one book could have on our lives.,Nan
21632_1,Once you leave the east and west coasts of America you'll see that most communities are essentially white.,You'll see you have little to no interaction with different types of people or culture.,and
27773_1,I was a different outlook than my usual experience,Sam did a great job talking about the subject,and
33347_3,"do us wrong the world would be a much different place, however, the reality is",that we can only hope this happens  it is much easier said than done.,because
39043_8,It's inspiring to see someone be neutral.,almost positive about the situation.,so
32124_1,It is inspiring to hear him speak about his faith.,It guides him though out his life to forgive others.,and
39282_2,Sam started talking about the numbers.,Sam started showing the class about today's numbers.,and
39045_1,It's sad to see these people face to face.,Be able to tell.,and
11427_3,"They could afford personal trainers, as well as lessons for any sport.",It gave them an advantage.,and
31346_4,Everyone has a different belief system what is great about the time.,we live in now is that you can pick choose what you agree with in the bible oppose to being forced.,so
19130_1,They were offered lower salaries.,They were given less rights.,and
9021_1,In the hot climates the hair is tightly kinked.,Because it is limiting the amount of heat it absorbs while protecting the head.,Nan
9125_1,This class is informative.,It has already taught me more than I thought it would the entire semester.,so
29112_1,I never understood how they could think that, highly of the bible such,and
35406_3,I see someone that went through many difficulties.,They have strong faith.,and
12000_1,"In today's world, a Native American/ an Irish person can come together",They can have a child that is this whole new kind of person.,and
29225_5, some Bible followers are passing much judgment., type of Bible they are reading.,so
41181_2,Bassim is able to separate the thoughts of the government.,It is a wonderful thing.,and
10356_1,One of the big ways racism is discussed is in the news.,Racism is discussed on social media.,and
26545_2,It is sad to think that many Americans have stereotyped Afghanistan people.,It is due to this war and the terrorism that started it.,so
31959_2,"This class helps us students begin to understand, learn to have empathy."," races, religions through his activities.",and
36334_1,The level of forgiveness Bassim has for Americans is wonderful.,It something I don't think I would ever have been able to understand.,and
23468_3,I saw other parts of the country for the first time.,I was taken aback ,Nan
8241_3,I think it is only fair that people respect that.,To allow others to share their opinions/beliefs.,and
26634_1,Each of us has the capability to show empathy/, I firmly believe that being empathetic is the key to understanding different cultures.,and
30171_1,I have many friends who are Muslim.,they treat you like family every day.,and
32391_4,They don't leave time to contemplate their effect on people.,This is why this class is important.,so
26682_2,to Enforce Christian on non believer,it will have opposite effect,and
22104_1,They get attacked by the Taliban.,They get attacked by Al-qaeda.,and
39313_1,Within the United States.,Subjects like living wages.,and
16181_2,I believe in one of the main reasons.,How dependent people are on the media.,and
26321_1,There is no problem with a legislator to practice their religion in their own free time., Using religion as an influence when creating new laws could be disastrous.,Nan
15558_2,Most people are choosing not to accept it.,People are surprised to see the two together.,and
19155_3,I work with people who have been deployed.,They can back everything the LTC says.,Nan
41792_2,I overestimated these statistics.,I underestimated these statistics.,Nan
27515_1,Just looking at pictures of how his life was was disastrous.,Looking at pictures of how it became after the bombing was disastrous.,and
20850_1,I am happy that Sam provided the perspective of the Afghanistan war from someone who is actually living in the middle of it.,I think it's important for the rest of America to see the war through this perspective.,and
39903_4,There would be efforts to lessen the attacks by the U.S.,The government wants to look good in our eyes.,because
41580_6,Sam challenged Christians to try to look at it from a Muslim angle.,You will see there are a lot of similarities.,so
11375_2,The professor picked some other Asian who was born in American. ,She asked four guys to determine who is international.,and
39912_2,I love how Bassim was able to confidently speak on his religion.,He didn't care who agreed.,and
41366_4,The sleeves cover their whole body.,They also have a garment which covers their heads.,and
29523_4,it does not justify me being bisexual,it ease the overall feeling of damnation due to god's love for all his children,because
36605_2,"Despite their differences, they are suffering.",They need our help/support.,and
35284_2,This was an interesting thought to ponder.,I am not religious.,because
20208_1, some people who are not accepting ,some people are hateful towards groups.,and
37978_2,What if they heard his story?,I couldn't even begin to imagine how different it would be.,and
22073_1,I notice different features about them.,"I notice what makes them, their ancestors, who they are.",and
29583_3,said screw tradition class rules.,allowed us to be innovative with the way class is being tought   ran.,and
37487_2,SOC 119 gives us the ability open up our minds.,the class period in which he discussed Muslims feelings about how they are treated in society was not something that I couldever completely understand,because
42059_3,It made me understand.,It made me realize how forgiving people can be.,because
30573_1,The video link you included was interesting.,It tried to make sense of conflict that arises.,because
36154_2,These prejudices come from a lack of knowledge.,These prejudices come from a lack of understanding.,and
37333_1,In my opinion 9 11 gave the government another reason on top of wanting Iraqi oil to invade Iraq.,It may sound shallow but I think that they used 9 11 as an excuse to invade Iraq to get what they really wanted.,and
39104_5,\ people make generalizations like that you can apply the exact same thing to people in the United States., we really don't realize it.,and
11819_2,They totally distort our images of the countries to make us think this way.,That was something I hadn't noticed until Sam pointed it out.,Nan
30956_4,They do have precise times they must pray. ," some people follow that to heart, regardless of where they are.",and
33577_2,the results of this war., I never really thought about what was truly lost.,because
33389_2,I am going to add a little to your belief comment.,I feel many of us close our minds to the possibility that other people are right too.,and
36721_4,it  relates back to Sam's article he had us read for the first quiz about race.,If race is actually a thing.,and
15205_2,Some friends pronounce the word like cray-on.,I prefer to pronounce the word like cran.,Nan
24522_4,There aren't any.,or the differences arent a big deal.,and
33853_1,Most other Penn State classes are the same thing year to year.,The classes lack the same level of engagement that soc 119 has.,and
27371_1,It's hard to hear of the hardships they went through during those times.,It is almost surreal.,Nan
21689_2,"Showed us pictures of his daughter, who was murdered in the war.",What actually goes on back there shows how unaware i really was.,and
32311_3, very proud to be wearing them., the topic does arise- there is usually a controversial feminism attack.,because
31642_3,Bassim had vacations with Americans.,All he saw was a good person.,and
32543_2,I think that it is true that it is hard to recognize things like violent Christians.,If you grew up in America the religion is predominantly Christian.,and
36526_1,"Overall in this video, I think it is important to note that Sam isn't attacking Christians.",Sam is not saying  they are one's that start more conflict.,and
13162_1,"As a society, we should crave to understand race.",It plays a big role in our lives. ,and
42456_1,I give him a lot of credit for having the strength.,"I give him a lot of credit for will-power to be able to move on from this devastating, life-altering experience.",and
12812_4,It is fine with me if after all the research you still want to believe America is the greatest country on earth.,but I won't allow myself to see America as this perfect place.,Nan
23667_1,Sometimes these groups are religious radical extremists.,"They follow their opinions to the point of being willing to end other people's lives, (in my opinion, insane).",so
39132_2,"We, as a people, thirst for power. ",We lose sight of all the good that could come to us. ,and
40799_3,He was positive.,He has been through a lot.,and
27999_1,Some of this is due to people moving to different areas of the planet.,it is not experiencing different enough climates.,and
7909_1,A benefit of social media is keeping people connected.,Another benefit is keeping people engaged.,and
31876_1,"Bassim deserves a lot of credit, getting through that hard time.",Bassim persevered without staying angry.,so
20483_1,Sam confused me.,He said that in Afghanistan you have to wait four years to get a divorce.,Nan
33355_2,It is cool to rethink about something.,See it in a new light.,and
31064_1,It was interesting to me.,Sam explained the differences of the Quran from the Bible.,and
19503_1,We should make a conscious effort to recognize what is going on in Afghanistan.,We should recognize the destruction of lives that it has produced.,and
31699_1,of course the class isnt going to be entirely made up of Christians.,the realization I think we all had was that almost every Christian,and
39324_2,"The American military has done harm to his life, along with to his family.",He has to keep moving on in attempt to move past the tragedy. ,and
38360_1,There is a good chance that whoever ordered that attack on his house in Mosul was a Christian.,66% of the military is Christian.,because
31986_1,"The class helps with ideas that seem far away, out of touch with us.",The class brings those ideas to light.,so
36118_1,"With technology being  accessible,", It is feasible to become,so
10114_2,People should educate themselves on the facts about genetics.,humans are much more similar than different.,and
25479_1,They denounce the Taliban.,They denounce what they stand for.,and
39379_3,It can be difficult to see ISIS are not Muslim.,Most people are generally not worldly.,and
16174_3,Try to set a goal for yourself to go somewhere else in the world.,Try at least _ amount of time at least every_ months/years.,Nan
20049_1,It will be a topic of discussion simply due to the nature of our education.,It is due to the nature of our political system.,and
39234_4,All Penn State students are looked down upon.,The Joe Paterno case happened at Penn State.,because
32672_4, they just make much sense really just show how,messed up the world  people of different groups can be.,and
40007_3,Ask the average American man,"bombing on Bassims house made them feel safer, they would probably say no.",and
8686_1,I definitely agree with Sam on this one.,I think it is fascinating. ,and
36838_4,Their way of life is not meant to degrade them.,It is meant to give students a new perspective.,and
30171_4,In America there's this constant fear-mongering.,People are misinformed about the truth behind religion.,and
31532_3,There is not divorce if the man just said the word.,It has to be in court.,because
25207_2,"The way we look at it now, its not personal at all.",We just think of it as something that happens. ,and
38059_1,There are women and men serving in the military without knowing the country they will be fighting a war with seems bizarre.,It makes me wonder if this is a strategy to makes it easier to fight with people they know nothing about.,and
33759_2,"Someone, a baby at that.",This is not something God condones.,and
36693_1,"He said that there was no difference between Bush, Obama, and Trump.",It was seen in they were handling the problems that face everyday people in Iraq,Nan
11608_1,Everyone is basically the same.,Growing up with this race and the differences in race have never been a big thing.,so
29496_3, watching them speak side by side was an image, that we normally don't see in today's society.,and
31158_2,I don't think I would be able to deal with the heat. ,I won't be able to deal with all the judging that comes along with it. ,and
7790_1,We were able to put a voice to racism due to that.,We were allowed to have progress to be made for other ethnic groups who still experience prejudice.,and
36712_1,religion is important.,"We can do wonders  helping people hold onto hope , forming morals.",and
22655_3,It may not be ethical.,They can twist the Bible into saying certain ways of being.,and
38979_2,the government leaders mention minority groups.,"the goverment is taking about about African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians,",so
28957_3, understand no matter what we are humans ,that is one fact that shall unite us all.,and
21544_3,"The reasoning for divorce should include something along the lines of not wanting to provide for the family, health.",The reasoning should be on lines of damaging or discriminations towards the wife.,so
16064_1,That is what the lesson showed us.,We need to do something about it.,and
15780_2,I thought you had brought up a few good points.,I wanted to address these points.,because
31353_2,"Or, beneficial such as when giving birth to the child would harm the mother.","Or, if the child would grow up in a very bad home.",Nan
20001_1,Not even people from the U.S. would have been as nice.,We would not invite a stranger into their home for a drink.,Nan
39113_7,what resulted to him afterwards?,Sam makes you feel  the Iraqi people.,and
36918_3,"Even though we have an initial thought on the people of those places from the media, there are many people there who have nothing to do with that. ",There are many people who can have similar beliefs to you.,because
20451_1,I meeting like this in the US will have a certain intensity to it.,Everyone would be looking for the facts.,and
12367_1,"Personally, I think that dating outside your race is a great way to immerse yourself into different cultures.",It helps a lot with understanding people from different backgrounds.,Nan
41792_1,I was the reason.,I overestimated these statistics.,Nan
25130_1,"In my opinion, that was the biggest take away from this video.",War is very real.,Nan
21355_2,I believe that God is very loving.,The Bible was written long ago.,so
27901_4,it isn't like we can call up the authors , ask  an explanation of something.,so
37944_2,We often try to judge others from different backgrounds.,We often try to hate others from different backgrounds.,and
39219_2,"Beyond the incidence, their responses were exactly like Basim.",They weren't mad at the government due to Buddhism teaching Buddhists to let go.,because
33481_3,he would have kept refreshing the bad memory.,make his emotion even worse.,because
40542_5,I instantly was in shock.,I immediately became enraged with the situation.,and
14837_1,People develop their own patterns.,People develop their own behaviors.,and
32385_1,We have seen examples of this in anti-gay riots people ,who believe that homosexual people will not go to heaven.,and
36852_4, ideology of radical Americans carry out the governments agenda.,There will always be fear in minorities  immigrants.,and
37933_3,I am sure that this will not be the last time., The topic of racial inequality is brought up.,and
31768_1,he continued talking about how a primary reason we,went there was to get this oil he compared that to,and
23734_3,They should celebrate our differences.,Maybe race wouldn't be such a taboo subject.,and
12452_3,There is a lot to talk about.,We have never really gotten past it.,because
31902_1,It was an eye-opening experience to actually meet someone who has been affected by these bombings overseas.,It was an eye-opening experience to learn their stories.,and
9534_1,The video begins with the topic of why a huge majority of NHL players are white.,"Next, why a huge portions of NBA players are african american.",and
34056_2,We should start personal work.,Find things out on our own.,and
13953_2,How much people have in common with one another.,They have no clue that they may share the same DNA.,and
20876_1,They only show the terror of what is going on.,It puts the picture of this awful place that only revolves around war in people's minds.,and
20187_2,They spoke about ersonal experiences about how these citizens and troops live day to day in fear of dying.,"Despite everything, they continue to be brave.",Nan
25858_1,It is just sad that since these radical Muslims interpret the Quran in a different way. ,"These radical Muslims interpret the Quran in a different way than the traditional, peaceful Muslims.",Nan
32034_4,There were diverse and extremely different people.,I was never exposed to them.,so
41426_3,I was very young during 9 11.,I didn't know security wasn't strong.,and
39369_1,I feel bad for the Iraq citizens. , There's talk of decreasing their already low wages even more.,because
40494_2,This is the reason I think the reason for war becoming more distasteful.,It is even more of a reason than widespread education and information.,Nan
8204_1,Sacred to them.But some people think it is okay.,Assume that their religion is better superior to others.,and
24170_1,He had a family just like Rafi.,He was killed for trying to bring people together.,and
30507_5," I realized that it did have some weird terrible parts,",no more than the Bible.,so
7971_2,I needed to learn about other races and religions.,That was my driving force to take this class.,and
8938_1,"Sam says, Can I touch your hair?",Sam shares with us the reasons why we look the way we do.,and
29825_1,"Mr. Rafi, a lawyer,  that can't lead a normal", simple life.,and
32449_1, The US  many Europeans are associated with Christianity," we are biased towards this religion, its followers, its teachings.",because
29980_1,interpretation of things are important,it allows people to explore and debate different ideas,because
14690_2,The human mind is linked everywhere.,The human spirit is linked everywhere.,Nan
22686_1,"John 12:47 says, If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge. him.",I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.,Nan
37226_3, topics that to help us create a definition., ourselves is a beautiful blessing we have.,and
28322_1,There is the issue Sam Richards brings up.,There is the issue of the interpretation of the Bible's teachings.,and
34884_3,I never could say Muslims were terrorists,They were regular guys,so
30394_1,I need someone to point out the perspectives/ideas from other cultures.,I'm not actively participating in other cultures.,and
30254_2,who i am disabled,who i am hard of hearing,and
36526_2,Sam is not saying  they are one's that start more conflict.,"he is saying for anyone, this is an opportunity to have a different viewpoint on others that will hopefully change your misconceptions and stereotypes of people that aren't just like you.",and
25765_1,It makes us more aware of the world.,We know how to take a different perspective.,and
40122_1,Its horrible.,"The Bible taken literally or even out of context can justificate peoples hatred for a race, gender, etc.",Nan
39838_4,This illuminates the methods used within our educational institutions.,This illuminates the effectiveness such methods have within our educational institutions.,and
8733_4,It is hard to figure out where people come from.,I agree with you.,Nan
35904_10,Question everything.,Be skeptical in finding truth.,and
29240_2,That entire class was moving to me., Rafi talk about how everyday he leaves his house.,so
39145_2, all the confusion of losing a family member.,emotions you feel at once is  terrible.,and
23548_1,"Growing up, we are all sheltered.",We begin to harbor our on ideas of what the rest of the world is like.,and
27471_1,Religions are all really similar for the most part.,That is something should be noticed.,and
10099_1,I think this is worst than talking about race too much.,"Even though people are not talking about it, the essence of the problem is still there.",because
23701_1,I did not know soldiers did and to me it makes doing what they do a lot more fascinating. ,It is not just about combat and violence like it is portrayed.,because
40737_2,Stop thinking about yourself.,Stop being selfish.,and
40766_1,He hasn't let the hate control his life.,He hasn't let the resentment control his life.,and
33353_2,I dont think that I normally see a Muslim commit a crime  say it is,"they are Muslim but, I think it might be a slight thought in the back of",because
24682_1,We should see what has been done to their people.,We shouldn't just hear about the terrorist groups that we hear about very often.,so
12473_1,They went as far as to say that Africans did not have the capacity to lead lives the way free un-enslaved whites did.,They were not smart enough to function without us.,and
34776_1,This comparison was something very new to me.,It served as a connection to their style of living.,and
24873_1,The answer varies. ,People put more meaning to religion than it would be expected.,because
29859_3," who Hinduism is riddled with rules  statements that, they"," were to be interpreted literally, encourage war against your own family.",and
41768_2,I always wanted a class where we could sit back. ,I always wanted a class where we could take in the information. ,and
39545_8,He has lost much.,and can still be forgiving is truly amazing.,because
34062_3,It hurts you more if you don't.,You'll keep dwelling on it.,because
39456_4,we keep seeing Iraq like a war ridden country.,we will never think anything of sending troops over.,and
41989_4,A lot of the media is actually hindering our ability.,It hinders society's ability to critically think about such issues.,and
23381_1,Every part looked the same.,"There were outdoor markets, restaurants, people walking/shopping, and homeless people too.",Nan
23033_2,There are so many forms of Protestantism.,There are vastly unique interpretations across Christianity.,Nan

30064_3,"I've seen this rallying of friends, family happen due to their religion.","This rallying of friends, family happens due to what is promised in the Bible or otherwise.",and
33570_1,Thats a problem.,religious groups don't follow those ideals.,because
39093_3,They can be empathetic. ,They have life experience. ,and
29275_1,Who its cool,Who is the person hair retains,so
42357_1,I love how Sam challenges us to think new things.,He challenges us to have empathy for other people.,and
41651_4,It's impossible to understand what they believe.,not love them the way they love themselves.,and
42411_1,Another thing that Sam said that really made me think was to be fair., look at others how you want to be seen.,and
31565_2,The city had five bridges.,The city had four-story buildings.,and
10325_1,"In other words, everything points to the fact that humans are all going to evolve differently.",Depending on their environment.,Nan
28524_1,Veterans are very respected.,Veterans are admired among society.,and
34420_8,He knew the people of America were not at fault.,and that he knows this and is not angry.,because
23453_1,This is genuinely upsetting.,I do not know what it will take to put an end to all of this.,and
14974_5,They can jump higher.,They look bigger.,Nan
36332_1,It is difficult to live by religion.,Follow the rules many religions bring it takes a lot of self-control.,because
33556_1,Many of us have stereotypes in our minds.,We do not think to learn outside of those stereotypes. ,so
34559_1,Americans have resentment towards Muslims.,I don't think it is something that can be changed in the near future.,and
33876_2,They seem unthinkable to the rest of the world.,they aim to thrive in their lives.,so
34910_1,I believe.,This is the way we are raised.,Nan
8862_2,One of the big headlines that I have seen on the news.,Is police brutality.,Nan
9217_1,Are what I believe have started the idea where white people saw themselves as superior.,Saw any other race as unwelcome in the country.,and
7988_1,It is such a difficult topic to discuss.,Everyone has their own opinions on it.,and
15372_1,Doing that is absolutely more accurate then just looking at someones skin tone.,You can really only tell a little by looking at someone's skin tone.,because
38725_4,How could he smile?,How could he give us his time?,and
40819_2,He experienced.,Listening to him talk about what he went through in front of 500 strangers was very inspirational.,and
20732_1,Afghanistan is generalized as a country of violence and hatred.,It is one awful group who is controlling the country. ,because
40891_3,By discussing why they wear them.,What they feel wering it.,and
28696_1,"More specifically, they were the variety that hands out New Testaments.","In the light of this lecture, this provoked a thought for me.",and
30762_1,I was baptized as Christian but don't ever go to church or follow much.,I don't really consider myself a sinner even though technically I am.,so
36108_1,I know that I would not be able to handle something.,It is heartbreaking like losing my family.,so
25768_1,We need to take away from lecture that we should be open to other perspectives.,We need to not judge quickly about something we do not even know about.,and
30615_3,Everyone decides individually the extent they will follow it.,Everyone decides the way they will interpret it.,because
39543_3,Going from being extremely upset to realizing that he was alive.,He thankfully had the opportunity to continue living.,and
31404_3, It's nice to know that this class is impacting everyone.,Making  us all think outside of the box.,and
20910_2,As many know the war on drugs disproportionately targets young black males.,Compared to similar men who are white.,and
10941_2,Someone who can stand in the middle of these race tensions.,Openly talk about each side.,so
19787_1,"He was a normal man, with a job, wife, and kids. ",He was coming to talk about how Afghans are people just like us.,Nan
36223_3,"Christianity has had acts of violence, barbaric ways.",It is very wrong to act like it never happened in history.,and
11265_1,"Typically when I see a person, I notice their race.",I notice not any specific details they possess that make them who they are.,Nan
15547_1,It is evident race is a very much discussed thing in the United States.,It has become a bigger topic in the past 10 years.,and
35842_3,It shows that sometimes you need to keep going with life.,Work to change what happened instead of dwelling on the horrible acts.,because
22490_1,I think Sam is right.,Sam says that it does not take much for Christian radical extremists to pick up weapons and start killing people.,Nan
25491_1,The problem with this is people in general are a complex species.,We have developed since this book was first written.,and
28557_1,There are countless ways someone can interpret a passage in the Quran.,I dont think a religious book filled with stories should be used to govern people.,Nan
39325_2,he was not angry with any of us about what had happened.,he has tried his best to move on from it.,and
31233_2,He should hear what the students involved had to say.,He should hear what the class thought about it.,and
34234_1,I hate that I had to grow up.,In a society where I would hear all these bad things.,Nan
30602_1,People have real lives.,People have families.,and
36060_8,He set himself free of the burden.,just forgave.,so
16205_1,civilian deaths often prevent more civilian deaths like seen with the fire bombs.,This was seen with atomic bombs dropped in Japan.,and
24064_2,It was written in the 6th century B.C.E.,Something written before common era cannot be what you base law on.,so
22041_1,I used to think like the rest of the public that the Afghan people are always in wars.,The image of them in public has nothing to do with peace.,and
30113_1,this lead to the believe act of violence is traced back to that religion,and they attribute their act of violence to that religion,and
30412_2,Look at the life I live today.,Open and free our world are polar opposites.,and
31730_6,Others take it as the only way to live.,Everyone else that doesn't follow the same beliefs is a threat.,and

34422_3,He has learned not to be angry at us.,He knows there is a separation of power between all Americans and those responsible for his family's death.,because
27962_2,Saudi Arabia enforce these laws that, its just how it works over there its,and
33144_2,Most Muslims who use Sharia law as a template to go about their lives believe in the more moderate version.,It is against unjust harsh treatment of others.,Nan

24406_1,He talked about communities coming together to develop a plan for a government.,They planned how to curb the Taliban.,and
36381_5,The feeling of danger in many areas.,"Everywhere, It is sad to feel such a way.",because

35871_2,Basim said he has many good friends that are American.,Basim has no problem with them.,and

33080_4,it was only consuming.,eating away at his soul.,and
12961_1,It opens my mind.,Made me think about my ancestors.,and
26697_1,Politicians are saying gay marriage should be illegal.,Politicians are saying abortion should be illegal.,and
28314_2,This may be true for some conflicts.,Groups like the Taliban are not able to look past their extreme views.,and
41052_1,Unfounded claims may justify violence.,Violence may by justified to achieve their goals.,and
32407_2,"Politicians in  out of my voting party, NATO, Doctors Without Borders ","other NGOs, both National  International news.",and
15313_1,I don't think I would ever volunteer in class.,I am very aware of how people are reacting to what I do.,and
37883_3,It is about having it in you.,It is about forgiving.,Nan
33553_1,With the technology world we live in today.,we have access to everything.,Nan
36012_1,This is the country that we represent.,This is the country that we proudly talk about.,and
25845_2,It is important to know about the Establishment Clause as well.,We should be able to distinguish the difference.,and
34648_3,being able to understand., relate to their pain. ,and
40036_1,This is something that needs to be stopped.,"This discussion in particular, as well as the Sociology 119 class as a whole is what needs to be done",and
27636_4,It was shocking.,It helped show how similar are our faiths.,so
20360_1,It is real.,It is happening everyday.,and
29064_2,I am not religious.,"I was forced to attend church, every Sunday.",so
29369_1,Some Muslim terrorist groups use the Quran to do ill.,it gives a bad reputation to all Muslims in media.,and
41982_2,Many big issues are changing throughout time.,Big issues changing throughout time makes it difficult for the bible to do a certain thing.,so
20182_1,I never took the time to stop.,I never took the time to imagine who is really fighting for us.,and
15475_1,He said that they acknowledge the past.,They apologized for what had been done.,and
42514_1,It wouldn't serve Bassim any benefit to hate all Americans.,All Americans weren't involved.,because
27921_3,I thought of the Middle East.,The image of war entered my mind.,and
27309_1,It is quite astonishing.,Even today we do not hear the whole story.,Nan
34572_1,Seeing a persons face and hearing their personal story.,Helps us to understand.,because
8576_1,I don't know what my answer to the question should be.,What is your essential belief about evolution and creation. ,Nan
42476_2,That made it more impactful.,They are thousands of miles away.,and
23445_3,"This way, many tragedies could be prevented.", Many lives would be saved.,and
39194_1,I am a Catholic., I go to church every Sunday.,and
34405_2,ignorance combined with confidence in ones own knowledge., this issue magnifies.,and
38756_1,Who am I as a third party to say?,Someone is oppressed.,and
8462_1,I am seeing more hils.,There is the most open space I've honestly ever seen before.,and
8929_2,It is definitely something i will take into consideration.,This will be a topic of discussion with him.,and
39295_1,"This class, Sociology 119, is teaching Penn State students.",Be aware of their surroundings.,and
36138_1,We were influenced by many wrong facts.,They blind us in many ways.,so
28447_3,Everyone deserves a prosperous life.,Everyone deserves a free life.,and
29276_1,He said the hair protects peoples head from the sun., it doesnt burn their head.,so
39875_6,He clarified that the reason the class is focused  on Islam right now., the class is focus is a ridiculous amount of Islamophobia.,because
35555_1,Religion is a touchy subject.,Religion should not be in politics.,Nan
39487_1,"I felt that, being a listener, I was completely uninvolved in the class.",Sam was mostly addressing the people acting out the skit.,because
31926_1,"This really hit me, the kindness forgiveness that", he shows in truly incredible,and
9587_2, I would say that books have definitely saved my life.,They helped me discover who I am.,and
30935_2,Blacks were considered a threat.,Whites were the ones with money.,and
38666_1,It's a flawed mindset to have.,How he can forgive lets him continue on in life.,and
42399_2,We are blind to see that the stem of our hatred towards other races.,We are blind to see that the stem of our hatred towards other countries .,so
26896_2,I always forget that there are actual real people,That live in these war-polluted providences.,and
21234_1,So many Americans get scared when they hear Sharia.,What comes to mind are Muslims and their way of life.,because
32773_3,"others think of me  my physical appearance, but I know not everyone", has the same confidence  mindset.,and
32944_1,It is in fact very hard to have a connection with victims of war abroad.,"It's unfortunate that there are many people, not necessarily in the US only.",and
14769_3,Made me think of how some groups of people can go thousands of years with no contact.,Yet they are similar.,so
20333_1,Finding parallels are interesting.,Notably those in Christian and Muslim radicalism.,Nan
30303_3, I can not just say Christianity.,We learned in class this day Muslim religion is practically saying the same thing.,because
26988_2,I was surprised that people like Jesus were mentioned.,I was surprised that people like Mary were mentioned.,and
24112_1,I stopped attending their place of worship.,For the last two years I have not stepped foot in a church.,and
31270_1,"From what I have seen, what every religion says is to be a good person that",dont screw someone elses life.,and
31647_2,He forgave.,He is now continuing his life,and
13094_1,We traveled with American college students,We made ourselves known.,and
14916_2,Immigrants can cling to their culture.,They can associate with those of the same background.,and
24043_2,The administration claims America is abandoning principles.,That is an attack on previous leaders.,Nan
26762_1,I found it surprising.,Muslims and Christians seem the same. ,Nan
24381_1,I live in America.,The war zone is in a different country.,and
24330_1,Basically what Sam was talking about was how people would like to bring Christian Sharia law to America.,He highlights the flaw in this.,and
39399_1,I find him inspiring. ,I find him admirable when he says he believes he will return to his home in four months. ,and
35614_2,"This related to Rafis attitude about life, Rafi said how peace is the most important thing in the world.",Basim being able to be at peace with Americans.,and
21762_1,"Nowadays, people live much longer.",They end up getting divorced very often.,so
16034_1,It was eye opening to hear.,I was able to visualize how real people are being affected by the war. ,so
19556_1,I was wrong to think that war is all that the Afghan people know.,I was wrong to think that their lives are much different from mine.,and
21684_1,The saying goes.,Out of sight.,Nan
39882_4, people do horrible acts of violence.,that does not  describe the whole religion.,and
21924_1,Rafi endures death threats everyday.,Rafi is trying to make Afghanistan a better place.,because
40350_1,The Dutch colonized much of South America.,The Dutch killed slaves.,and
27440_1,I am very confident in my religious beliefs.,I do believe that my God watches over everyone.,and
40418_2,The Afghani people do not want the United States there.,Their government changes so much.,because
37622_1,Sam repeatedly makes the point.,We're all human.,and
21625_1,"To me, this is wrong.",Skin color does not matter. ,and
32851_3,My opinion is very objective., It doesn't work well in these responses.,so
14464_1,I know.,They have distinct features.,Nan
31275_1,I have a brother in the US military.,He left to serve six months in Afghanistan.,and
38086_1,A primary way these groups of people take over people.,Dominate societies.,and
29580_2,which fundamental principles,who its the reason we are fighting.,and
33060_1,He talks about his faith.,He talks about how it teaches him to forgive.,and
10371_1,We went to the king's palace.,It was twice the size of the white house.,and
37226_1,I think that we can have opinions., topics that to help us create a definition.,and
29262_1,a good portion of the public don't empathize,it does not affect their lives besides a little increase in taxes,because
35244_2,It is a negative way.,It burdens the reputation of their religion.,and
27358_1,The radicals and terrorist do awful things.,They do not do it because they are Muslims.,Nan
41367_3,They dress in formal clothes daily. ,They wear Yamikas. ,and
32554_3,Something specific happens upon making with connections with people from certain places.,Something becomes easier upon making connections with people from certain places.,Nan
37853_2,they do not listen to the other side's argument.,This is one of the major issues in this country.,and
38598_2,We all know the history of America with racial tensions.,I dont think I have ever explored it  in depth.,and
35000_5,less prevalent in our society.,we have a much easier time making generalizations.,and
41432_3,I feel like many just brush off the ugly sides of their own culture.,Many focus on the negatives of everyone that is different.,and
27284_2,"They use that god to justify violence, war, and murder.",They do this on the grounds of a few minor dissenting beliefs.,Nan
26054_1,They mass murdered Native Americans.,They put them on reservations.,and
42109_1,"This is total misinformation, classic.","People, forget to find out the real facts  believe hearsay instead.",and
11705_3,"The may be just the vocal minority, ","Again, they may not be everyone.",and
33977_1,Such a thing is unimaginable to me., I've known safety all my life.,because
27962_6, its just how it works over there its, what the people believe in  its all in the name of Islam.,because
26763_1,"Similar to the bible, two people can read the same passage.",They can comprehend it two different ways.,and
34786_1,It really shook me up .,"Like you said, his life was so normal.",because
27320_1,Who is only one person.,Which has ever lived on this Earth.,Nan
36847_1,We are live in this Western world to fulfill an education.,We are able to raise a family in this country.,and
40234_2,College really exposed me.,Realize that there are many great people. ,so
39373_3,Everyone doesn't want to think the worst of it .,We often see Christians being violent.,and
23699_1,Their job essentially is to study these people.,They aim to gain knowledge on their society.,and
35629_4,I see my dad often., but I have never had to live with him full time.,Nan
32990_1,That english professor that visited us in class last week presented ,us  with an opportunity to widen our horizons culture ourselves.,and
7778_3,We don't talk enough about race,Both sides have valid arguments to support their positions.,and
30663_1,I thought so as well,the bible is about god and jesus,so
29929_1,these hate groups consider themselves christians,many refuse to believe that,and
14818_7,He wants to show different sports using the pictures.,t's not a totally comfortable topic to openly talk about.,because
40028_3,He spoke how he told himself he had to move on. ,Life moves on. ,because
28497_1,He is willing to risk it all.,He is willing to die to bring peace for his people.,and
32435_3,"family members, he himself was injured due to this",accident is something I would not want to ever know the feeling of,and
24305_1,I would never want to be lumped in with those beliefs.,I have lumped muslims in the same way into their extreme beliefs.,Nan
31836_1, we were able to forgive the people responsible  the attacks of 9 11 , any other terrorist attacks we have suffered were able to separate the small,and
30631_4,Class discussion broaden our minds.,We really question those things we have grown wo live by.,because
25317_1,I find this interesting.,"You would think that with all this power that they have, that if they ask for it they get it.",because
32601_4, our government barely even acknowledged the amount of pain., stress we put him through.,and
11600_2,It is just how people are raised.,They don't know any better.,and
33692_1,I believe 9 11 was a huge factor in us going over there.,If it hadn't happened we wouldn't have gone.,and
22445_1,It is important that people need to understand the realities of every religion.,This would stop them from generalizing them through assuming the facts.,so
35282_3,How incredible the strength was.,He had to turn around and forgive.,and
15099_1,Race is a very interesting topic to discuss.,It is something.,because
31503_2,It is hard to know what is right.,It is hard to know what is wrong.,and
42426_1,I have great respect for Basim.,If it were me in his situation I would not have the same reaction.,because
40213_1,Technology in the past sixteen years has literally changed the world.,We can see news around the world.,Nan
7938_3,The easier it is to differentiate between different roads.,The easier it is to find your way around.,and
32693_1,99% of believers are peaceful nice humans,its the 1% that brings out the fear in us,and
30463_2,Religion and governemnt would be separate for very good reasons.,Then we have people like him trying to change all of that.,and
30507_4," I realized that it did have some weird terrible parts,",no more than the Bible.,and
38420_1,I am sure that his frustrations drove him crazy.,I am sure that his thoughts drove him crazy.,and
28074_3,I pictured the war being so tragic.,I pictured the people being terrifying.,and
30200_3,this is most definitely true,I have never thought about yet realizing I am a person who does that,because
27168_2,It is important to do our own research.,We judge things that are talked about in the media.,so
42753_2,Sam tried to shake their hands.,They all pulled away.,and
27160_2,It is something they talked about before.,The media has given Islam a certain image.,because
41363_3,She explains Muslims as very forgiving. ,She provides examples of how the Quran supports that.,and
26625_1,I find it horrifying.,I find it humbling.,and
34902_2,was extremely enlightening to me.,it demonstrated how we need to interact.,because
26168_1,The religion and bible are quite clear about sexual promiscuity. ,The religion and bible are quite clear about what is and isn't acceptable.,Nan
42167_1,It is a class.,We are learning about much more outside of the classroom.,so
35957_1,I wrote about the topics you wrote about.,I could not agree more.,and
26663_3,Americans could see Afghans in a better light.,Many would change their minds about the war.,Nan
20378_1,Most of the population is against this war.,Most of this population wants peace.,and
15445_1,All the nonsense Involved him.,He's scares of something bad happening.,Nan
39031_1,America by accident bombed his house.,It killed his wife along with his daughter.,and
21087_3,He is the best person I know.,I could not imagine that he prefers men over women.,and
33357_5,from a little kid that was treat others how you want to be treated  I think that ,the world  lost this mindset a little bit  has gotten to being very self-involved  not thinking about others  we should.,and
41580_5,Sam challenged Christians to try to look at it from a Muslim angle.,You will see there are a lot of similarities.,and
32959_1,I agree with this part of lecture tremendously.,I feel that most people dont understand that Americans tend to somewhat block out all the negatives that come from Christians.,because
37705_1,Men and women in America fought literally.,Our government wanted to profit from the oil reserves.,because
31302_3,The Bible was the main source.,The Bibles was the guideline for our law system.,and
16338_1,I feel that there are a million ways to discuss this topic.,I'm very interested in hearing alternative opinions.,and
20012_1,He wants us to think.,This class is to make us think.,and
26605_3,It also teaches about compassion.,It also teaches about acceptance of the other.,and
32040_2,"Like most times, the US likes to be involved in other countries.",The US dismantles a lot of things.,and
31545_5,I consider myself a Christian.,I never sincerely thought about how many people the Bible states are unqualified to go to Heaven.,because
9177_1,This is what I think.,Another factor makes race a big deal in America.,Nan
30691_1,So why do not treat them with the same disdain as other groups.,The same disdain as other groups who are accepting and instill fear in others.,Nan
14804_1,It resulted in a different society from one that never had a large enslaved population.,"In particular, a society where the descendants of the enslaved live in it's borders. ",and
40454_5,He has accepted the fact.,he must continue to forgive.,Nan
39015_1,There is much hatred.,war across the world that continues to ruin families.,so
21057_1,It made it unavoidable to actually listen to his story from his own mouth.,It made me think of the unthinkable number of people with stories just like his.,and
42291_1,The news created a fake story.,The news make the team look bad.,and
29475_1,I absolutely love the way you explained your interpretation of the Bible.,I loved your entire response.,and
42270_1,This scenario not  much.,I know people that I know would never do it.,so
37190_1,America is a twist of conflicted truths.,"America is  just, free, amazing country we claim to be.",Nan
34962_4,we can gain what we want from the situation.,The country that is already struggling with terrorism.,so
20645_1,I did not realize how many things were considered sins.,"Even when they are conducted in a minor way, they could inhibit you from reaching heaven.",and
21432_2,The teachers say if you sin and dont repent youre automatically going to hell.,What the teachers said was terrifying.,and
42115_1,I agree.,Most people are biased on this subject.,because
40722_1,I think incorporating religion is big of him.,He incorporates religion into how he deals with sadness. ,and
28080_1,Colonel Garey shared his stories that , insights of his military experience which,and
19159_1,The stories were good.,I connected with them all of them.,Nan
33409_1,It was designed., Religion would not influence it.,so
40544_3,I feel.,Dropping a bomb is something that takes a lot of planning.,and
32799_1,One thing he had to say to the class was that he wants us  to, be more aware of people  places outside of the U.S..,and
38366_3, I took it., it is different .,because
24520_2,He used these two books.,I think people typically do not think of in a similar way.,Nan
35629_3,I live primarily with my mother.,I see my dad often.,and
42669_1,There was a man who works on a cocoa farm.,He only makes $4 a day.,and
35973_2,"At the same time, Bassims point that the anger only hurts you. ",Anger does not benefit you in any way. ,and
32812_6, I even think this course might be a good idea.,similar courses are required.,and
30511_5,They are homophobic. ,They chose to hide behind the guise of religion,because
37895_2,"It troubles me that people around the world, looking in, might think that Iraq is gaining some sort of stability.","It troubles me that people around the world, looking in, might think that Iraq is gaining some sort of liberation.",and
42528_5,"Jesus said, try explaining the inquisition!",This sarcastic cartoon shows clearly politicians.,and
28146_2, he believes in trying to build a strong relationship between the Afghan people .,the US military.,and
42764_1,We can sometimes have the luxury.,We can sometimes ignore the war.,and
20004_2,These people are just trying to survive to make their dreams happen.,Our military obviously doesn't put that into perspective.,and
35815_1,I have gone to Catholic school my entire life.,Believe fully in God's power.,and
33661_1,Sam's friend listed reasons why women are allowed to separate from their husbands.,Men are abusive.,and
20827_1,If this is the criteria for being authentic.,Then what about American-Asians?,Nan
26307_1,It's not because we mean to.,We also grow up surrounded by stereotypes and common misconceptions.,because
26648_5,He said that there are things that we will disagree with.,It's easy to just admit one section that we might not agree with.,and
10463_7,I've grown up now.,I've realized that his words haven't had any effect on me.,because
40806_1,He easily could hate the United States.,He  easily could hate the West for the atrocities they have perpetrated against his family,so
11766_1,We have to study and learn from our history.,We have to make sure that it doesn't repeat itself. ,Nan
37711_1,I would find it hard to move on with my life.,I would find it hard to find the motivation to live on.,and
21723_1,I have never really been taught about the Muslim religion.,I think it lead to me being easily influenced by the negative portrayal of the religion ,and
31769_3,It gave me a new perspective of how it would have made me feel if people came to our country.,It gave me a new perspective if people treated us the same way we treated people there.,and
41477_3,We all fail. ,We need hope.,and
37803_1,Much is happening every single day in different countries.,People aren't paying attention to.,so
11686_3,It has stained this countrys integrity.,Stained by the US enslavement of African people.,because
35529_6,There is separation of Muslims in the US through the media.,There is alienation of Muslims in the US through popular stereotypes.,and
30499_3,I was confused,I would stay up long hours into,so
22076_1,"I know that the people who protest gay marraige have lied at some point lied, stole or commited a sin the Bible claims won't let you into heaven for.","But yet they are adamant about this one sin, and it's awful.",so
15698_1,You could argue that India has roots based on racism as well.,Someone still turned out differently.,so
10349_2,We are all equal.,That is exactly what infuriates white supremacists. ,Nan
35867_1,He trusted that his religion would guide him through his life.,Would give him the strength to move on and cope.,Nan
41053_1,"And whatever privilege they may want or achieve because of whatever group they call themselves part of, wont last long.","They will be left to deal with harsher consequences, in my opinion.",Nan
30590_5,This gives a sense of realism. ,they deserve more than our stereotype of them.,and
8715_1,"However, many people in all race groups are very stubborn.",They are very rooted in their beliefs.,Nan
35999_1,I thought this lecture was interesting.,We can agree that the Bible is interpreted in many ways.,because
25265_1,"In other words, according to the law, teachers, lawyers, or political figures, cannot express their religious believes. ",Teachers cannot favor one religion over another to support a certain idea or perspective.,Nan
25013_2,They are putting their lives on the line.,They are not just another statistic.,Nan
11253_1,Mixing babies can could improve thier worth.,Without color the sun weakens the genes white people is actually self destructive.,and
35436_2,These Shows always show bombings conducted by the Taliban.,These shows always show bombings by Isis.,and
35210_1,They might see an ISIS member.,They think that person is not a real Muslim.,and
23350_1,The war affected people physically.,Civilians also started experiencing mental and psychological problems.,Nan
23552_1,"For instance, I had no idea that the Muslim culture was so similar.",They have a single god they pray to.,Nan
40368_2,It causes complete chaos and devastation.,We must take responsibility for the destruction.,and
32017_1,Basim uses his faith to guide his life.,Basim transformed his anger into motivation to fight for peace.,and
42172_1,I never thought that Muslim girls wore hijabs.,any sort of direct oppression.,because
39877_1,It's easy for people to cknowledge all the bad things that happen.,Between or relationg to Muslims.,so
30593_2,We tend to be too busy to give someone a gift just because.,We are meeting up with them.,Nan
38730_2,I tried to imagine the heartache he must have felt with being overwhelmed with the sadness of losing his family,then the consuming feeling of the anger on top of that.,so
11512_1,"In day 4 of class, Sam took a dive into issues.",He talked of opinions associated with ancestry/ culture/ race.,and
33703_1,Not only has he lost nearly everything he loved.,He also lost his faith in his country getting better in his lifetime.,Nan
37264_1,"Sam said that if this was said in difference societies or if the religion where substituted for Jew or Muslim, the backlash would be so much greater.",its really the desensitization of the public to statements like this in society that are really frightening especially when these politicians run the direction of the country.,and
39254_1,Listening to Basims story genuinely broke my heart.,I cried tears of sadness.,and
38991_2,The one thing that continues being mentioned over again is Basims heart.,I referred to what an amazing heart he had.,and
15159_1,"On the other hand, I know that not everyone has the opportunities.",I know that not everyone has the resources.  ,so
25783_1,The fact is  that Rafi risks his life to help spread what he believes.,He belief in the better good for his country is astounding.,Nan
39983_2,he was feeling numb.,he was not  able to believe what has happened to him.,and
32672_3,I just really liked all of the points that you talked about, they just make much sense really just show how,so
30453_2,People need to take the good messages the books say. ,They use that in their lives. ,and
42432_2,I was  excited to hear from Basim.,I was  excited learning about where he is from.,so
27084_1,You have so many questions on your religion.,You have so many questions on your religious teachings.,Nan
20557_2,We do not fully understand.,We believe that these concepts are applicable to reality.,Nan
34577_2,I thought it got in the way of their daily life., It turned out this is actually the opposite.,and
23751_1,I am able to feel safe most of the time.,I am happy with where I live.,and
13069_1,I missed class to talk to the shc associate dean about it.,That was my experience as a Freshmen at Penn State.,Nan
19535_2,They are in the war zone.,They call it home.,Nan

41611_1,He wanted everyone to be aware of everyone around you.,That there is life outside the U.S.,and
31598_1,Nonetheless I believe Sam Richards is making a positive impact.,To fix a problem you first have to know that there is one.,because
38377_2,ISIS changed the country.,Did so much damage.,and
22677_3,The story was really sad.,It made me disgusted with our government.,Nan

9052_8,We talk long.,or if these social injustices are happing too much.,and
30533_1,I chose to respond on the video.,What is Sharia.,Nan
40995_2,We only look at the extremists.,We only pay attention when something big enough happens.,and
25642_1,"Without being able to know about all the religions and cultural differences around the world, I believe many people will get stuck in that one-sided mindset.",They blindly judge others without much knowledge.,Nan
36002_6,"He said that there is one, of many reasons, why he is very motivated to keep going.",He believes there is a reason that G-d allowed him to live.,so

33652_3,It is extremely difficult to follow everything other religious writings have set out for us.,Things are very different today.,because

29079_7, the media does not show us the realities of America., which includes the mistakes we make and the destruction we bring to other countries.,because
33966_4,There are so many that share my beliefs.,I would be ignorant to deny the views of one just to conform to another.,because
10163_1,We have done these things due to race.,We have not addressed these things.,and
25687_2,I had the privilege to be taught to treat everyone equally.,I was taught to never formulate my opinion from someone else's.,and
37335_1,This was very interesting for me. ,I never really understood the life that people were able to live while this huge war was going on right in their front yard. ,because
12128_1,I can relate to this as a white person.,"As a kid, when I was growing up, the toys and posters I had were mostly from hockey and NASCAR.",because
12132_1,"For example, when looking at different sports, some of those sports, like hockey, require more equipment.",Some of those sports require more infrastructure to allow for people to play and develop their skills. ,and
31533_3,As you said it is not fair. ,Married couples have conflicts.,because

21714_1,We went to war in Afghanistan.,"The United States as a nation was attacked in one of our worst tragedies, 9/11.",because

37055_5,We are not responsible for his anger. ,His anger is only hurting himself. ,and
14369_4,It is ridiculous to think.,k that skin pigmentation is not in the same category.,and
39069_1,I'm very grateful that we had the opportunity to speak with him.,Listening to his story was very eye opening.,because

26535_3,When someone mentions Afghanistan I think of poverty.,When someone mentions Afghanistan I think of our soldiers being shipping out to sea.,and
22280_2,The guest says the reason the soldiers were able to have that conversation.,They have an understanding of what each other went through.,because

31346_2,Everyone has a different belief system what is great about the time.,we live in now is that you can pick choose what you agree with in the bible oppose to being forced.,and

34127_4,I can't imagine the intensity of pain Basim had to deal with.,I can't imagine the anguish Basim had to deal with.,and
27351_1,It is different to hear Sam say Christian Sharia.,That is not a term I have heard before.,because
33006_3,Time goes on.,The bible becomes outdated.,and
22086_1,The impact of wars and how we decide to ignore what is happening around us is just one way to explain this.,Having real life encounters and speaking to a victim directly changes how you view life and others actions completely.,Nan
31647_3,He is now continuing his life,His religion guided him.,and
9552_3,Poorer cultures tend to be seen in African nations.,Poorer cultures tend to be seen in Asian nations.,and

41911_3,He continued to actively communicate with them.,He did not have an alternate view because of what happened.,and
38731_2,He is in a country where so many hate his religion.,They hate his country.,and
16228_1,Why does it seem that a majority of hockey players are white?,Why are most basketball players black?,and
20523_1,Sam even said that this story was not reported on in any US media outlet.,There are hundreds of more stories like his.,and
40880_4,The media should release the facts.,Basim can get the respect he deserves.,so
34504_4,The world is a large place.,We are only a small part of the world.,and
29865_1,I asbolutely agree with you.,"Christians,Muslims are not different from each other.",and
41806_1,Sam brought a good topic about what his main objective is.,The main takeaway from his class.,and
39451_1,"Re-telling the stories of Iraq, for example, opened my eyes up to what we were really doing.",Re-telling the motives behind the war opened my eyes up to what we were really doing.,and
40969_2,I believe having anger can harm you.,It won't make you feel better. ,because

25759_1,Rafi narrated the sad story of the kids who were trying to show a peace sign to American soldiers.,They ended up dead by not finding the right bridge to communicate.,and
24616_1,Christian ideals against homosexuality.,Many other things puts many people on the outside of what would be considered acceptable under a government school system based in Christianity.,so
39086_6,People like Basim who have it way worse.,and still manage to forgive the country who has hurt him and his family.,because
15085_2,They're exposed to different backgrounds.,They're exposed to different ethnicities.,and
35741_1,I feel very strongly about the topic.,I agree completely with your post.,and
31661_1,"I didn't do that, it all sounded ridiculous."," I put myself in an oppressed, black persons' shoes.",so
42271_3,I feel very sorry to  his family.,he did not deserve this.,and
35335_1,It is human nature to judge the other person doing something wrong., It is human nature not seeing the flaws in oneself.,and
14825_1,I enjoyed this response.,I connected with that video.,and
30356_2,Henry VIII separated the Church of England from papal authority.,"It was an effort to have an annulment with his first wife, Catherine of Aragon.",and
41887_4,it was intriguing and semi-sad to see., they are (in some way) still oppressed,because
11568_2,Equality is not shown within those opportunities.,Despite what is written in our constitution.,Nan
8919_2,Although our new and younger generation doesn't discriminate between people on the basis of race.,We still talk about it.,Nan
41239_1,I could never imagine losing so many members of my family to such a senseless act. ,I could never imagine losing so many members of my family to such a careless act. ,and
39436_2,It was extremely eye opening to hear about his life.,the unfortunate tragedies hes faced over the last couple of years.,and
34546_3, they have started reporting whatever sounds most interesting, get them the most views and clicks.,and
19366_1,"Being this prolific in identifying peoples origins, I came to Penn State.",I thought it would be just the same.,and
11173_1,I did my post on the same video.,I had a similar viewpoint.,and
33125_2,I always remembered one thing. ,Following the Bible is the best way to live.,and
31683_1,There's one that we all know.,It will forever be remembered.,and
30289_1, Reading a few books on Afghanistan  doing some research that,"on the country, I always thought that Afghanistan was a war-torn country,that",and

24741_1,The vast majority of the country is like us.,The media does not show that.,and
40479_5,To an accidental bombing.,Showed much compassion talking about us U.S. citizens.,so
31922_3,Everything he loved in his life was taken from him.,Our government's mistake took those things from him.,and
31696_1,It helps you through hard things in life., helps you live your life every day in the image of g-d.,and
32182_6,"who how his religion teaches him to forgive  now,",In Islam is  often shown in a negative  hateful light.,and
27341_1,I think having Rafi come was eye opening.,I think having Rafi speak was eye opening.,and
13007_3,The people of the middle east are basically all terrorists.,It became the generaliztion we have.,Nan
22930_1,There are radicals everywhere.,To assume that the majority of a faith follows the same beliefs as them would be wrong.,and
27821_2,All for the sake of religion.,Engaging in other things denounced in Corinthians.,Nan
29298_1,Religions aren't umbrella terms under which everyone holds faith in the same way.,the actions of radical individuals are no representation of other individuals.,and
40494_1,This grows worse as more civilians become caught in the crossfire.,This is the reason I think the reason for war becoming more distasteful.,and
28188_2,A lot of times in our own culture we do not see outside of our culture.,Someone from outside the culture comes in.,because
37796_4,Therefore being better off to be an activist.,Create a movement of change.,and
26011_2,One of them was a native of Afghanistan.,The other is a Lieutenant Colonel in the Army and heads Penn State's ROTC program.,because
23691_2,The media wants people to think we're doing the right thing over there.,They want to live in blissful ignorance.,and
30663_2,the bible is about god and jesus,I should follow as it should be true and correct,so
14554_1,I like your point on pigmentation.,I like your point on adapting to colder/warmer climates. ,and
34396_1,The country is filled with real people living real lives.,Unfortunately it is not.,and
23239_1,We see an article about immigrants coming to the US.,Some people will then view them as freeloaders.,and
25843_1,I hope that we can become educated on more events concerning our countries and others in the future.,We need to be able to continue to learn more information that we would never have learned anywhere else.,so
29421_3,growing up with them made me realize Sharian law is really the same as Christian beliefs and practices,"They share similarities with a lot of other religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, etc.",so
36547_4,People break the rules of it as they please. ,There is no possible way to amend every political disagreement with the words of one single book.,and
39694_3,He shopped in malls that are similar.,He had a family he loved.,and
25573_1,What have these men gone through?,What are they going through?,and
36134_1, Mohamed is right when he says we should all feel a little more empathy for others.,In the end we are all humans.,because

23324_3,He was brutally murdered.,He did the same work Rafi is currently engaged in.,Nan
8254_1,I agree with you that it's very empowering to know this.,Without all of our different features our ancestors wouldn't have survived.,because
9697_2,I was so surprised to see.,I confused as to who was Korean or Chinese.,Nan
31588_4,Allow themselves to explore.,and cultivate as human beings.,and
26936_2,My friend sitting in my row admitted to being the only fornicator in the room of nearly 700 college students.,The subject remained fresh in my mind.,Nan
27891_8,There's people in these radical groups., who take every single word so literally.,and

23368_1,"Of course, the school said absolutely not.",They did not want to favor them over other students.,because
15646_1,You stated that people are often prejudice to others.,Those people don't realize that they might have the same ethnic background in common.,and
30666_2,Admitting that you need help is the hardest thing to do.,It may never happen.,and
21104_1,They fight.,We can remain free.,so
12982_1,Our president is judging a full race not getting to know them.,This makes racism more evident in society.,so
15982_1,"We hear the number of deaths, the number of citizens in the affected areas.","We have only a broad, limited perspective of war from across the world.",and
41439_1,Social media was used in its intended purpose.,It would be a blessing.,and
14817_1,He asked all of us to look to the person next to us.,He asked us to explain the significance about that photo.,and
8098_1,What would happen if we all lived next to each other for most of our lives.,wouldn't the accents slowly become one universal accent?,Nan

26548_4,We get to really understand the perspective and culture there.,I don't understand it was only an hour 15 minutes.,because
7514_1,There needs to be more education in place.,We must try to eliminate the unintentional ignorance in our country/world.,and
23099_3,The man he talked to said he could not be Taliban.,The man said they choose whoever has the most power.,and
36486_1,what was  important about this lecture was that it made us realize that we need to think of other people.,I think what was important about this lecture was that it made us realize that we need to think of other people not just those of our own,so
42670_1,There is not only life in the United States.,we should reach out  to help those in need.,and
7581_1,Genetically we are all literally the same species.,Our physical traits are an adaptation our ancestors had have to be able to survive.,and

32060_8,Bassim said angry was eating his up,"Bassim knows it was not American people's doing, it was the US government.",because
27606_1,Its interesting to see.,So many people can relate in regard to their physical characteristic.,Nan
37928_1,Sam certainly could have used more detail.,He could have used more thought provoking examples.,and
29185_1,This is completely true.,Interpretation can be varied.,because
38751_1,This opened my eyes.,I was able to see why some of the people from these areas feel the way about America as they do.,because
28218_5,Those who tend to radicalize the Bible don't see they are wrong.,The Bible tells them not to kill others.,so
12167_1,I believe that we are all different in many ways.,Skin color does not define the way we should treat other people.,and
10014_1, I've always had an understanding of those who've felt demeaned., I've always had an understanding of those who've felt discriminated against.,and
39061_3,Keeping faith in yourself.,"Losing your family is something that takes a strong mind, heart, and soul.",and
15748_3,His family celebrates Christmas on December 25th.,They usually celebrate in the morning/early afternoon.,Nan

30013_6, I feel some people forget they've had haircuts,i have eaten pork that you want this to go away you can go to confession.,and
35826_2,People are allowed to believe in whatever they choose. ,People are allowed to do mostly whatever they would like with their lives. ,and
12301_1,Racism/ prejudice can do this to people we do not know.,It can be used to make it easier to achieve a goal.,because
8645_3,I felt guilty for misidentifying others.,Guilt doesn't make sense.,and
33747_1,"Its all the same, nothing has changed.",every new president will promise something.,Nan
31261_1,He says that peace will always win. ,I think it's something the United States struggles to embrace. ,and
34013_1,Basim was presenting himself so calmly. ,I truly couldn't understand why.,and
41573_7,They're changing the world.,I feel like  there is no point in showing interest.,because
26610_2,He suggests Christians do the same things as Muslims.,"They should interpret the bible, as they wish, to create sound arguments for law.",Nan
10811_1,It is very refreshing to hear.,It is very flattering to hear.,and
36058_5,The military's actions were cruel.,It is natural to assume he would resent our country.,and
10382_4,I was intrigued in listening and learning more about what Sam had to say.,These same thoughts had popped up into my head.,Nan
42018_2,Unless you jump into another person's shoes.,Unless you think of the situation from their perspective.,and
38675_1,Our society is vastly different than the time these texts were written.,Many of the text's messages need to be filtered.,so
42730_1,The reason why Basim is able to forgive easily might be the fact that Basims home being bombed was an accident.,9 11 was purposeful terror attack.,and
41660_2,That's not reality.,There are people who act the same from both religions.,and
13815_2,A lot of people do not realize.,We are less than 1% different.,Nan
33792_1,Here we are in our SOC 119 class at Penn State., this man is far from us.,and
36069_4,to see that we are not different.,people have problems just very similar.,and
38462_4,Sam wants to be able to empathize.,understand why these issues matter.,and
33498_1,I have never detached myself as a citizen of the United States.,I thought about how from outsiders.,and

14913_3,We understand it was inhumane.,We never feel sympathy or responsibility for it.,Nan
14397_2,He is only being able to dunk that high.,He is only being able to jump that high.,because
32932_1,"It's things like this class that really opens my eyes, reminds me that", I have an obligation to know who is running my nation what my nation's affairs,and
32281_1,Both were written many years ago without much knowledge on precisely  how ,the future would be but set universal standards that should be followed.,Nan

7822_1,I think lecture should be an opportunity to hear other people's ideas.,"It should be an opportunity to respect their ideas, not condemn them.",and
36677_5, he explained the stereotypes Muslims must face every day .,Islam is a  peaceful religion.,and
16463_1,You don't have to date someone of a different race.,Not dating different races doesn't automatically make you racist.,Nan
21549_2,"By bringing Rafi in to speak with us, we saw a real life person.",We saw in Rafi a real person with a real family.,and

39993_2,Sam made points during class.,The things Sam raised in class are valid.,and
12004_1,A mixed individual cannot be placed in a stereotype of a certain race.,A mixed individual is more  than one race.,because

9045_2,He had suffered from racial profiling.,He had suffered from police brutality in Las Vegas.,and
35399_1,We are all constantly aware of what war can do to people.,We never really get an opportunity to hear it from them first hand.,Nan
7566_1,I noticed in high school that most of the people were just ignorant to their privileges.,All their friends were the same.,because
35665_4,They are more forgiving. ,It is what the Christian religion believes in. ,so
39662_2,Off of their character.,Doing that don't assume.,and

30533_3,I thought this concept was interesting.,I didnt know much about the Sharia.,and
15870_2,He would just meander the streets.,Sam would accidentally convert to Islam.,and
23157_1,We tend to forget sometimes about all the atrocities/ war going on in the world.,We aren't directly affected by it.,because
9275_1,This is hard to address.,Any given race has many different body types.,because
35034_10,"Even with all of the loss/suffering Basim endured, he found the strength within him to move past the destruction of his livelihood.", and continued on with his live and moved in a positive direction.,because
38067_4,He had American friends. ,He lives in our country. ,and

42497_1,"Many, many, many of the people I surrounded myself with growing up were Jewish",today my very best friends are Jewish,and
38839_2,we learned that many people from the Middle East who follow Islam are very friendly,They are friendlier than Americans.,so
11790_3,We all have African roots.,Homo sapients first evolved in Africa.,because
38398_1,I think that surprised a lot of us.,Its a perfect example that shows how much we can learn.,and
8624_1,"The last few years of winners were Nihar Saireddy Janga, Jairam Hathwar, Gokul Venkatachalam, Vanya Shivashankar, etc.",None of them were white.,and

34933_2,I give Bassim so much credit for not hating the government.,The government did this cruel thing.,and
35423_4,All he had seen from us was kindness.,All he had seen from us was hospitality.,because
30251_1,We feel a certain way about laws in this country.,We feel laws in this country are extremely limiting.,so
35289_2,It is an accurate metaphor.,Few people actually experience life outside of the cave.,so
9291_2,The majority of the white men in this country would not be attracted to a black woman.,The thought doesn't even cross their minds.,and
38201_1,He continues to do so.,He knows things will never be the same.,Nan
38416_3,I think people accept what happens to them.,To not expend their life's energy into anger.,so
27004_4,Extremist groups try to promote their own selfish agenda.,Extremist groupes use their bizarre interpretations of sacred text as justification for doing so.,so
39764_2,It played out in my mind how the future could possibly be like.,Especially is something unexpected and tragic happened to me.,and
33643_5,Why would you get attacked or targeted as a victim if you hadn't done anything wrong?,youve been sustaining the country for many years.,and
29164_1,I go on social media.,There are tons of people.,and
27738_1,This would fall under same category as security,a lot of woman needs someone else to provide for them,because
38887_4,having classes like soc119., talking to people of other cultures.,and
39532_2,I thought he hit the nail on the head.,This is what was going through my mind.,because
15695_1,"India is years behind on accepting the rights of women, LGBTQA, and the bottom 1 %.",It is behind on even giving respect to interracial marriage.,and
37920_3,"At the end of the day, time doesn't stop.",Neither should we.,because
8555_2,I love talking to people.,I love learning about their cultures.,and
38806_2,The effects of  this war ,The war has had on innocent people ,and
33634_1,I think that Americans need to hear more stories like this.,We truly do not grasp the horrors that go on from this war.,because

35240_2,you will see.,hear people.,and
32965_1,"Not only did he spend time here, make friends, relationships,  see our country,", that he seemed to have thoroughly enjoyed his time in the States.,and
20056_2,We never truly get to see that.,Americans have a false mentality of third world countries. ,because
29154_3,it made me realize how nave I was being when thinking of Afghanistan in that sense,it made me sad that all Rafi kept saying was how important peace and brotherhood is,and
31570_3,he was forced to leave Mosul.,it struggles to decide he should go back along with many others.,and
31231_2,"  talked about how they had scripts to follow, which makes sense.", I wanted to hear more from them.,and
15471_3,Does talking about it actually just raise the level of hate of our past?,Does it raise disdain of our past?,and
37783_2,This is a man who is educated.,He has gone to a university.,and
41266_2,I am accepting of everyone.,I have a big heart.,and
31528_1,I hope the U.S. begins to take actions toward those who do not follow the establishment clause.,I do not want our country going down the wrong path.,because
11653_2,Someone hails from Kansas.,Someone hails from Haiti.,so
40642_2,They may have to do with our economy.,They may have to do with sports.,Nan
11514_2,We don't talk about race enough.,There are people who clash over this.,Nan
25548_1,I found this segment to be very interesting.,I am a Christian myself.,because

24569_1,He gives several examples of Christian people.,"They are criminals, living by the Bible.",Nan
10492_1,These are generalizations. ,Black culture and white culture are different.,Nan
25662_1,Their families have lived forever.,They love it so much. ,and
39795_5,Mosul was wiped out. ,Imagined my hometown being wiped out was really displeasing. ,so
31012_2,They are all told the same way. ,You know which is true. ,so
33219_1,"If Iraq did not have this natural resource, the U.S. wouldn't be in this country.",Most of the wars could have been avoided.,and
28080_3, insights of his military experience which,during class  I thought it was fascinating to get his opinions that,and
30387_2,I agree 100% that people often hate on religions.,I agree 100% that people often hate on ideas they are unfamiliar with.,and
20522_1,I am not saying by any means that I am a close minded person.,The stories about the innocent people living in these countries are rarely reported on. ,Nan
40459_1,Some of Basim's stories sounded like an absolute nightmare to me.,He was able to sit there.,and
22199_1,We are talking about this topic.,I recently saw a lot about this on twitter.,because
37082_2,We have a bad idea about Muslim.,We do not know many things about them.,because
8380_2,We look very different.,There are small similarity that stand out that everyone inherited differently from our parents including grandparents.,and
16058_3,I couldn't believe that.,We don't realize how much our military has done for us.,Nan
7681_3, I like to think that when Sam or anyone makes things like this a point of discussion.,People stop overthinking it and start to just do.,Nan
28200_1,I also agree.,It's the origin for certain religious cohorts discriminating against one another.,and
38134_3,He overcame these major obstacles in his life,He maintained his inner peace,and
31215_4,"Overall, I  thought that this portion of the class was particularly interesting who", Dr. Richards did a good job  usual being able to flip things around  ,so
41816_2,He brings up all these statistics.,Show us contradicting information.,and
10034_1,They can be narrow minded in the ways they think about human evolution.,They surely do exist.,and
21632_2,Once you leave the east and west coasts of America you'll see that most communities are essentially white.,You'll see you have little to no interaction with different types of people or culture.,Nan
19242_1,"No matter how hard it might be, I think everyone should always focus on the good things about themselves.",Everyone should just go with it.,and
40716_4,He helped us understand Muslims. ,The war has affected the everyday lives of Middle Easterners. ,and
40723_1,I know I would most likely feel the same way about that happening.,Even in my country there are things that people have to put up with against our government.,and
31269_1,Now to go off on a different tangent.,A lot of people make their religion dominate their life too much.,Nan
24879_1,It was important that he did to show us that the people in Afghanistan are real people.,The people in Afghanistan are real people that live lives very similar to us in America.,Nan
25207_3,"The way we look at it now, its not personal at all.",We just think of it as something that happens. ,and
31047_1,He comes back to describe the outside world to the minnow.,"However, the minnow pictures everything/everyone with a fish body.",and
37865_2,"Thought that $2,000 would be enough to cover the damage.",They have created in his life disgusts me.,and
40335_3,You can see eye to eye anything they have been through.,It may be a bit shallow minded.,and
33352_4,I had not realized.,I never see someone who commits a crime here.,and
20389_1,He adds that they are generous and giving.,He has experienced their hospitality.,and
20909_3,There is a much greater chance of getting randomly pulled over.,You have your car searched.,and
38512_2,He  takes his studies more seriously now.,This is because his god did not let him die.,and
38235_1,It makes me think.,why does the U.S. government have to be so harsh?,Nan
27053_2,We enjoy demonizing the other side.,It justifies our cause.,and
15068_2,It is truly amazing how much you can learn about a person's society.,It is truly amazing how much you can learn about a person's age.,and
33064_1,Why is it that men  woman are continuously seen  unequal ,that many years of fighting  equality.,so
27430_2,They are just stationed on based and do stuff there.,"They are constantly doing stuff to move up rank, being in the military isn't all about shooting.",and
27096_1,Each religion has its own Bible.,People may have different opinions on what their god is trying to tell them.,Nan
36115_1,This lecture was definitely very engaging to me.,It made me realize that people can forgive something terrible has caused them harm.,so
32409_3,He taught everyone in that lecture hall about broadening our minds.,Think about people who are not in our world.,and
25763_1,I think that people do not take other perspectives often. ,People do not truly know what is going on in the world around them.,and
25422_3,He learns about them.,He learns how our military can help protect their population. ,and

32599_6,I am aware of so many more people.,I am have never felt better about myself.,and
40836_1,"In the far past, war was unpleasant. ",Its glorification was not something that was a great thing. ,and

35931_2,I believe that is what should justify the securement of liberty.,This is what should justify the creation of a more unified nation.,and

24412_1,But it was very interesting to see what it is really like over seas.,It was very interesting to hear personal stories about their lives.,and
16008_2,All Afghan individuals are dangerous.,It is not the case at all.,because

28188_4,Someone from outside the culture comes in.,Someone from outside the culture points out obvious things we do not see.,and
31613_2,"In my church, I am taught life lessons.",I am taught the importance of education.,and

19487_2,It's how something ought to be.,It's also blinded by the media.,Nan
32808_1,I want to learn more about the war.,I barely know anything about the war.,because

37686_1,There is a reason why hate feel  terrible.,We have the ability to overcome these feelings with time.,so
30338_4, we look down on it.,the war we seem to think everyone is a bad person over there.,and

22969_1,I feel like Sam presented this point very well.,The way he connected his points and the logic he implemented made it very difficult for most people to argue with.,Nan

29162_1,you understand media can not simply tell you U.S had a role in the rise of Taliban,it would be considered unpatriotic,and
35812_4,That is okay.,We walk around every day with rage towards someone.,so
38603_1, when the black devils (whites) were saying they do not believe in their rights., that is always the way things have been.,because

35219_1,He used his religion (Muslim) to guide him.,He went through a tough time.,Nan
15797_1,We should be able to identify different people from different regions.,We all have our own unique cultures.,because
27918_1,I have read the bible,there are some lines that can be interpreted violently,and
21864_1,They take even a few minutes to learn more about their own culture/religion's violence.,It is easy for a majority of them to feel okay in doing this.,because
11714_1,I automatically thought tall as well.,While he explained that this helps.,and
32153_1,He uses his religion every day in his life.,He uses his religion in this troublesome time.,and

38418_2,every religion preaches forgiveness.,every religion preaches peace of mind.,and
14592_5,some people look the same., yet come from completely different parts of the world.,so
37486_1,"However, as an African American, who grew up in a very diverse neighborhood, it was easy for me to resonate with the things being said. ",It was easy for me to be familiar with the statements. ,and

25733_1,Why can't Muslims see Christians as muslims?,Why can't Christians see Muslims as Christians?,so
42747_5,We talk about how Muslims kill each other.,We talk about how Muslims commit terrorist acts.,and
40255_7,That is what God wants.,", then I think that establishing a faith like that is something that I believe will be extremely beneficial to my outlook on what life throws my way.",because

26829_1,This lecture was good role-play.,I applaud volunteers who chose to switch perspectives of races.,and
41238_2,I feel it is time as a society we start accepting others as individuals.,We shouldn't see them as an entire religion.,and
31321_1,It never crosses my mind.,It has nothing to do with me.,and
29153_2, enlighten everyone on the fact that there are people living in Afghanistan., the people that live here in America was really eye-opening me.,and
38387_1,Basim is truly an example of what letting your religion guide you in life should be like.,hes truly someone who opened my eyes.,and
10962_1,Many different factors shape the way we perceive interracial couples.,Many different factors shape the way we perceive dating outside our own race.,and

25423_3,Our military can understand how they train and recruit.,Our military can understand how they get their money.,so
28674_1,Basim is my idol.,"Whenever times get tough, I know not to make excuses.",and

36210_1,Numbness that will carry on with you forever.,You can't seem to let it go.,because
8042_2,We have problems of our own.,Issues that haven't been addressed due to our ignorance to their existence.,because
8116_7,I think that that's cool.,and interesting that the majority of the United States won't be white anymore.,and
39884_1,It was a great idea to have the roles reversed.,Everyone viewing the lecture had the ability to see the raw emotion of the students who were chosen to speak.,because
20140_1,Lieutenant colonel Richard Garey deployed himself in Afghanistan with many of his troops.,He knew that there is a large chance of no survival.,Nan
24945_1,We automatically assume that the Afghan people are the bad guys.,We just always affiliate them with war and hate.,Nan
13153_1,Our physical appearance.,It is our story.,because
14575_1,it is not fair to say that you know for a fact that something is better than another.,It isn't fair if you have not experienced both firsthand.,Nan
34382_4,We would be able to see we aren't different.,Our problems in our country.,so
28608_5,Jesus said one thing.,They interpret it twenty different ways.,and
29244_2,I know there are a lot of people that are a bit unsure of how to approach a topic.,This will allow them to gain insight.,because
40742_1,He did admit he was upset at first.,He did admit he was angry at first.,and

35661_1,"Yet, the problem is that this happens all the time.",We don't even realize it.,and

29326_2, find it very similar to the way in which you took your faith,adapted it to a way in which it worked in your life its that,and
29075_1,I kinda think that it would just go back to how things are somehow.,I kinda think some way history would correct itself to how it is currently.,and
36270_4,I do believe that there is someone out there that believes in all good intentions.,I do pray to that God at times I feel necessary.,and
36798_3,He saw true kind Americans.,He knows true kind Americans.,and
9560_1,There are plenty of blacks who are a part of the middle/ higher socioeconomic classes.,That has not always been the case in our country.,and
24882_1,Sam mentioned the real things in Afghanistan.,He showed us an example of the real people there.,and
14948_1,Most people point of the way I exaggerate.,To me the little differences are funny.,Nan
31642_2,Bassim had vacations with Americans.,All he saw was a good person.,and
39631_5,millions of people were murdered really puts into perspective just how minuscule.,there was a  ridiculous islamaphobia really is.,and
27914_2,The majority of the country is Christian.,You don't hear as much of the militant actions taken by those groups.,and
30455_1,That makes so much sense.,How are these people going to establish an entire government and laws that are based on a book.,because
35080_2,He allows us to dive deeper.,We become more educated on the motivations of people.,and
34133_1,I did not realize that the United States entered Iraq long before ISIS did., I also did not realize that ISIS made the Iraqi people conform to so many different regulations,and
30109_1,"As Americans, we take any violence mentioned in the Quran",immediately conclude that is the reason why Islamists are radical and violent people,Nan
26133_1,Sam pointed out that racism is made into a big deal by Americans.,We are willing to talk about it.,because
40998_2,It was about the kids circling the soldiers with the incense,Them getting shot for that is appalling to me.,and
42505_2,We are so incredibly used to the mindless repitition of our classes today. ,We rarely get anything real out of them.,and
36089_3,They pulled down four girls who did wear hijabs.,They got to ask each other questions.,and
8256_3,It's eye opening to learn all our features are this way for a reason.,That those reasons helped us to survive up to today.,so
41726_3,he lost his family members at the hands of our government.,"he understands the majority of us stand with him , will offer our support.",and
29524_8,radical hate group I honestly don't think the bible states that god laughs ,soldiers die i think they are ( religiously uneducated like you said )  just adding their little racist flare into the mix which  does reflect christian ,and
35900_2,Someone was sleeping peacefully next to their wife.,Suddenly their house erupts.,and
35554_4,the way we live our lives now is not how the people lived their lives back at the time scripture was written,it is just an invalid reasoning as to why people should use scriptures such as the Bible or Quaran as a guide to law,so
24286_1,I was surprised by many of LTC Garey's comments.,This was regarding how most of his time was spent during his tour in Afghanistan.,Nan
40339_1,The Bantu tribe lives severely differently than us.,It is impossible to fathom life for them compared to us.,so

38819_3,It is easy to think that Middle Eastern people are violent. ,We have our own violence right here on our own soil.,so
41429_1,Their adversity inspires me. ,Their courage inspires me. ,and
37182_1,We are not the greatest country.,The fact that many Americans think that we are is horrifying.,and
41764_2,I think that it is a really miraculous aspect of the class.,Considering the way a school normally works.,and
41986_2,Not what the Quran may state.,It causes conflict the rest of the world.,and
34861_1,I've never considered myself a particularly forgiving person.,I know forgiveness is a major tenet of many major religions.,Nan

22406_1,I really enjoyed listening to Raffi speak.,It changed my view on how we see others.,because
33771_4,we forget.,that the Iraqi people lead the same life like anyone else in the world.,and
35011_1,he things that would make us unrighteous in our religions eyes are things that everyone does.,It is ridiculous to think that we will be denied heaven.,and
26538_1,"Many Americans, like me, are oblivious to the real devastation of war.",Countless families live in fear in Afghanistan.,so
10336_1,All their lives people have thought they were white.,Their skin is that light.,because
41580_1, Christians view Muslims to be bad people.,Sam challenged Christians to try to look at it from a Muslim angle.,and
40791_1,I hope awareness can be raised.,As  a country we can do better.,and
11891_1,Black Lives Matter and other movements may not need be a thing in the future.,We wouldn't value the white race over others like some supporters of the All Lives Matter movement do.,because
27339_1,it is our failure to not realize,there are children unable to find a safer place,and
19040_1,You choose to forget what a particular person did.,You choose to be okay with it for the rest of your days.,and
38486_2,People like Basim make it possible.,To turn that pattern around,and
33431_5,we said here were sorry.,how does an insignificant amount of money sound.,and
19075_1,There are still civilians. ,Normal people who have nothing to do with it.,and
37801_1,I chose this video in particular.,I thought that every word of this advice he gave was valid.,and
41536_1,The only thing that some muslim nations see is our weaponry.,efforts of sheer force in their domestic lands.,and
21068_1,No one else will even consider talking about them.,These are the things we should be talking about.,because
35702_3,Not everything in the Bible can help with the things.,Going on in today's day.,and
36060_6,Anger would not solve anything.,He set himself free of the burden.,so
36687_3,I respect his characteristics.,That is what I always remember about him.,and
15974_1,I was very fortunate enough to grow up in a diverse area.,I was exposed to many cultures and humans.,so
8336_1,I need to learn more about facial features.,I need to learn what they mean.,and
41916_3,People would probably question the Bible deeper.,Is their really a God.,so
31657_2,this was the topic we covered., I know a lot of people relatively felt the same way.,and
31958_4,the flow strategy teaching it keeps the class exciting.,"fresh nobody, not even Sam, will know what might be discussed each week.",and
27761_1,a child standing up to parents regarding controversial social issues such as LGBTQ movement and the afterlife is rare,starting with that dialogue is good,so
31829_1,One benefits you in the long run.,the other will do nothing.,and
14547_2,That's why i have lighter skin.,That's why I have paler eyes.,and
19582_4,It allowed me to identify with all of them.,to see all of them as real people.,and
21288_1,They kill innocent people.,They blame them on the destruction.,and
30289_3,"on the country, I always thought that Afghanistan was a war-torn country,that", rife with poverty  famine  full of people who are  much different than we are.,and

27105_4,His people would put their lives on the line to fight countrymen.,I thought his people was kind-hearted.,and

16407_9,We stereotype their country with a negative connotation . , they are just like us.,because
32011_2,They destroyed his homes and cars.,"They killed his wife, daughter, extended family.",and
38843_4,Imagine US presidents claim they will change their foreign policy from the previous president.,citizens in other countries barely experience the difference,because

37203_3,during the 8 years he met a lot of American people., a lot of American people became his friends.,and
42264_1,It was meant to make people get out of their own shoes.,It was meant to make people look at something from a different perspective.,and
23428_1,There no certainty of life.,"They are living life with a threat of explosions, assassinations and attacks.",Nan

33875_1,They have such big hearts.,They are so resilient.,and
33708_1,This man has suffered by the hands of the U.S. government.,How does he feel no anger towards America?,so
21226_1,I did know that this was a secular nation.,I did know there is a separation between state/ church.,and
33048_1,Bassim is an amazing person.,People have a lot to learn from Bassim.,and
37074_3, people lose their minds.,people go insane.,and
8691_2,We saw that during the exercise.,A man from Costa Rica.,because
40258_1,Im sorry I dont know his name.,I was not in class this day.,because
34314_4,He met many kind Americans who are extremely kind.,It is different from the US government.,and
35210_3,They think that person is not a real Muslim.,they  look at a white supremacist.,and
30671_1,Radicalizing the Bible is never a good thing to do.,These accounts were written thousands of years ago.,so
26247_1, I have begun to realize that the Afghani people have been negatively affected by our government over time.,Our presence in Afghanistan can be hard for them to take at some points.,so
28541_2,There is a process to deal with new scenarios.,Elected officials decide on new forms of legislation.,and
11535_1,"At some point in time, I would hope that we would no longer separate us by geographical race.",I would hope that we would recognize us as one whole human race. ,and

34041_1,He said he has American friends who were very supportive.,His American friends were good to him during his incredibly hard times.,and
38642_2,we need to step out of our comfort zones.,embrace what it is like in someone else's shoes.,and

37316_1,Not being able to have a safe education or a safe home is something that nobody should have to face.,that's just something I feel as if everyone should have.,because
34663_1,a person can lean toward.,find faith when hope is lost.,and
31174_1,The words written in each of these books are subject to their own personal interpretation.,Until people realize that these books were not written to govern bodies of people.,and
23355_1,We should not attach sexist ideology to a holy book.,These ideologies like racism can result in a cult-like following of those who agree with the sentiments attached.,and
11734_3,We need to combat white supremacy.,We need to speak more about it to come to terms.,so
33584_2,"Weve all seen the destruction in photos  things on the news, but weve all ",pretty much been lead to believe that the radical Muslim groups like ISIS  the ,and
37992_2,Sam gave us the opportunity to speak.,We speak with such an amazing person.,Nan

34399_4,Were killed.,As a result of this fighting.,Nan
37675_1,I do not think people should use the Bible or the Sharia for a law making guide.,Some people may interpret each thing differently.,because

15376_2,Both parties do have to project what is on their mind.,Not what someone wants to hear.,and

40821_3,It is truly motivational. ,It shows his strength. ,Nan

39734_2,I can't imagine that awful tragedy happening to him.,I can't imagine that awful tragedy happening to his family. ,and

22825_1,Sam mentions people use the Bible.,They use it to determine how to live.,Nan
33573_2,They say these people are so caring.,They say these people are very nice.,and
33925_3,It's not really shocking.,It's always really been this way.,and
20344_1,We can step back.,We can look at ourselves,and
16357_1,"To it all together, people are dating outside their race.",Fact being that they just do not care about the color of another individuals skin.,because
8733_3,It is hard to figure out where people come from.,I agree with you.,so
40708_1,Barely having a father figure in my life took a toll on me growing up.,He and I stopped talking for five years.,so
34528_2,Taliban forced all women to wear the veil.,Taliban forced all women to cover their faces,so
27666_1,I have to agree with that.,I am a Catholic.,because

41328_3,I think people should research the lives of everyday citizens there.,The information is definitely available.,and

36988_3,He explained how he has American friends. ,"He explained how he is upset with the government, not civilians. ",and
11865_1,I grew up in Philadelphia.,I was surrounded by a mix of black and white kids growing up.,Nan
14750_1,It could increase the competition of sports.,It could gain a larger audience.,and

22658_1, I most certainly do not believe people should be harmed for who they love.,People should not be harmed for why they love them.,and
41115_2,I hope.,It can continue for the rest of the semester.,and
32641_4,It's because a lot of people have never met someone of the Muslim faith.,They have not had a conversation with them.,and
33283_1,It is important to learn.,It is important to understand a religion.,and
9511_1,He emphasized the fact that playing a sport is simply derived from one's culture.,The way they are raised is also taken into account. ,and

25985_1,It opened my eyes to what is going on in the other side of the world.,It sparked my interest in learning more about Afghan culture.,and
19523_1,There is much one can learn from someone else.,Take a few seconds to look closely at the other person.,so
30489_1,it was incredibly hilarious,Sam asked the class who all was going to heaven based on bible criteria,and

10494_1,They think white guys play hockey.,White guys think in the same way.,and
41174_7,They claim that other religions are inferior.,They claim that other religions are false.,and
35812_1,We may never forget.,That is okay.,and
15868_2,So much of it was him lackadaisically attending class.,He was often switching majors.,and
38386_3,We listened to him explain how he was able to forgive us.,almost no one in the room could ever imagine this tragedy befalling them,and
28495_2,He has an amazing wife.,He has a lot on the line. ,and

20191_2,Taking a step back makes you realize that they're trying to live life just like we are.,On top of the normal stresses of life they deal with a literal war.,and
42052_1,He likes Americans.,his friends have treated him well.,because
40277_3,I tend to get angry.,This would have ruined me.,so
8823_1,White people are better at some things.,Black people are better at others.,and
42071_2,I am glad this topic was talked about in class.,I really did not know any of the information that he was talking about,because

15513_1,I only took the class because it is required.,It is required for my rehabilitation and human service major.,Nan
41848_3,"By now, I'm sure they have become quite used to these changes.",They have become used to these changes to the extent that they don't even realize it.,so
33956_1,I think that this class is so important,It get us talking about things that we are often too uncomfortable to discuss.,because
29540_1,I think to the religious wars that have been fought.,"are currently being fought, it makes us  humans pick a side.",because

41332_3,This was someone's life was destroyed.,This continues to happen around the world.,and
39439_3,Tragedy struck that was far beyond control.,This relates with the point made in another clip about America.,and
21295_2,But a place where people live their daily lives.,Just like us.,because
21089_1,Our minds will generalize the opposing country often times.,"It is easier than thinking about the civilians, who are just like us, being negatively affected by the wars.",because
34221_1,", Trumps statement is not factual.", a lot of the Dreamers are contributing to the economy.,because
36792_1,It's his religion.,That is the reason he is strong.,because

38835_3,we read about the Christian kid who  killed multiple black people at a church.,his beliefs interpreted that there was a need to racial cleansing.,and

9456_2,Make your own opinions of countries.,"Base your opinions on what you actually, physically see.",and
38425_5, asking why me?,"Basim rejects the hatred that is  easy to succumb to , such a devastating tragedy happens.",so
23152_1,Then we granted them equality.,Society still treated them as lessers.,and
11211_1,We unkowingly are even more racist.,Don't bother to ask about their ethnicity or culture.,and
38940_2,the tragedy that many people like him faced.,what they lost within the situation.,and
29414_4, I heavily associate Afghanistan with war with terrorism., the thought of the normal,and
21807_1,Many military personnel are risking their lives for our nation.,The military personnel could be people we know.,and
42164_2,I have noticed myself more concerned about how interesting their culture where they came from must be.,I have noticed myself more concerned about how interesting their heritage from where they came from must be.,and
37408_1,I don't think I actually retained a lot of the information that was taught to me.,I was young.,and
19309_1,The Bible says sinful people would not be allowed to enter the Kingdom Of God.,They must first serve their penance in full.,and

34272_2,Why the government always tends.,To be a trouble maker.,Nan
11275_1,It shouldn't be weird to take a closer look at someone.,It's how we learn.,because

16232_4,Many believe you need good eye sight.,and a long arm span.,Nan
42287_1,In soc discussion we talked about the protest going on in the NFL.,The players are taking a knee during the National Anthem.,Nan

22305_1,LTC Garey began his story by saying he had his unit had been searching for a high up Taliban member for quite awhile.,LTC Garey had been unable to locate him.,and
32248_1,One of your last sentences about right and wrong is hypocritical.,If we are using passages for right and wrong we are still using the books for their purpose.,because
28247_4,These people had as much to do with the tragedy as I have.,These people had their lives torn apart.,because
20365_1,"Many people, myself included, are unaware of important daily world events.",They are also unaware of the politics of it. ,and
35187_1,I was  excited.,Obama became president.,so
22194_1,I went to catholic school my whole life.,I have many different lessons from the Bible drilled into my head.,because
34376_2,They think that Islam is an evil religion.,That's simply not the case.,and
39305_1,I talked about how the radicalization of these religious readings can be interpreted in different ways., radicalization can lead to the formation of some of the group you mentioned in your response.,and
25930_1,I assume most of these groups gain followers that are already hateful of a certain group.,They are told that they could use the Bible or Quran to justify the hate they already have of another group.,and
33328_1,This may not be a well known fact to many Americans.,What we hear about our presidencies is very much focused on ourselves.,because
10751_2,People have very different backgrounds.,I think this is would play a big role in why race is so relevant in America.,Nan
38088_1,Free speech allows people to grow.,Unlimited communication allows people to grow.,and
19580_1,It was eye-opening to have class with him all the same.,"Despite all we hear about Islamic extremists, in this place, my Iranian classmate was just another person like me, and like the Italian, French, Egyptian, Indian, Venezuelan, and American students.",because
23322_1,"Even though he has received multiple death threats, putting his family in danger as well. ",He continues to do what he does in order to make a better world for his kids.,Nan
29093_1,I fell victim to what the media.,other sources say about the enemy.,and

8626_2,Brooklyn is one of the most diverse cities in the country.,Many of my peers and classmates in high school were extremely intelligent.,Nan
36342_2,Americans generalize whole cultures.,Americans generalize whole religions.,and
9494_3,"Often times, I avoid the subject.",I try not to make comments about it.,and
41237_1,In class we met Basim.,He follows the Muslim religion.,and
14520_1,He decided to deny the alt-right people to come to Penn State.,They weren't allowed to speak to the students.,and
36272_4, I  cannot imagine what he went through.,  I  cannot imagine how strong he had to be to be able to recover from it well,and
38461_1,"For example, the other day in discussion, we were talking.",The saying black lives matter was too specific.,and
26582_7,He has a new home.,He continues to love his remaining family. ,and
23717_1,They're trying to live their lives as a family.,They're trying to avoid the turmoil around them.,and

41850_1," Sam explained,its the only thing we see.",t Iraq is just a war zone,and
21324_2,I can't say it's wrong.,It's definitely not one I agree with.,and
41831_1,Bassam's family died, the US invaded iraq for oil,because
38117_1,Basim realizes this.,He goes into talking about how he believes that his life in Mosul is probably over.,and
41270_1,I do support war when it is necessary.,I do believe it to be important.,and
15098_1,I think that everything you stated was put very nicely.,I completely agree with your opinion.,and
8963_1,She asked me if I wanted to disprove God.,I cried.,and
27712_5,who say your dad was being vague,That he doesn't really know what to say,because
10752_2,Future generations will not have the same racial divide.,Everyone will view each other equally.,and
41422_3,It was not them who killed his family.,It was not them who destroyed his home.,and
29944_1,the truth is the truth regarding our rules ,it answers why it functions that way,and
11465_1,More kids in that town will end up playing football.,More kids will play football professionally than baseball.,and
41393_1,All right.,I disagree with you on several fronts.,so
26825_1,"In some cases, it meant innocent civilians lost their lives.",They were suspected to be affiliate with ISIS.,because
34877_3,Something happened to him.,I couldn't agree more.,and
42069_2,I personally would like to thank Basim  sharing his stories.,I personally would like to thank Basim  sharing his lessons with the class.,and
10511_1,My friend was called up this lecture by Sam.,Sam asked what she was.,Nan
27591_4,Soldiers can connect through their share experience.,It can help them heal.,and
20640_1,I did not realize the specificity of the text.,Many people interpret it differently.,so
12144_1,Sam begins to tap.,"Comparing the difference between Basketball, the difference between hockey.",and
24176_2,It happens within the same states but different regions.,This is similar to people who are from New York.,so
20074_1,To me it is inspiring.,The epitome of one man making a difference. ,so
26836_1,That fact is due to societal constructions.,That fact is due to America's racial history.,and
39802_4,We believe that each President has their own values., Basim shows us that this is not true.,because
33470_1,"The event that happened to Basim was a heartbreaking, devastating tragedy.",It is inspiring how he can still have such a hopeful outlook on the future.,and
35548_1,He is an inspiration to us.,A very strong message all those people who want to spread hate in the world.,and
41918_2,They took over.,They began to convert people's religious views.,and
32992_6,"  it in our own world, but it is easily acknowledged  looking ",at  Muslim territory it differs from us.,because
33828_1,a key takeaway.,most westerners find sharia law to be crazy.,and
15675_1,I do not understand football at all.,It is not a common sport back at home.,because
26931_1,"I am a  bisexual woman, I have heard quite a few times that I will be going to Hell from Christians that  seemed kind .", Ive  wondered how many of those people ever bothered to read the Bible in its entirety.,and
35118_4,the reason why I don't believe that one religion is the way to salvation is because dissenting opinions is part of human nature.," My faith in God tells me, he recognizes that dissenting opinions is part of human nature.",and
25934_2,The majority of the country is Christian.,It's hard not to use the two together.,so
41572_4,This is really important.,I am typically only concerned with the news and current events when it is relative to me.,because
26962_3,"who religion, an institution purposedto emulate that thankGod, ","should reflect her generosity, forgiveness,  love.",and
23590_1,We are all humans.,I believe that we should stop putting labels on those people just because of their ethnicity.,Nan
27476_4,they can be interpreted in many ways.,Sam's example were great for demonstrating this,so
34532_3,In many ways we can only get a sliver of what he must have faced.,Even then it isn't easy.,and
35716_1,"Like you said, we usually look at our previous leaders.",We find major differences between them.,and
20606_1,"Sure, people may get jealous of the way others look.",They think this other person is better looking.,because
41241_1,The easy route would've been to just hate America as a whole forever.,He was able to overcome his hatred. ,and
33644_1,America government accidentally bombed Basim's house.,They are willing to offer Basim only few thousand dollars.,and
33647_3,Being accepting to someone who wants to learn about your culture is something extremely priceless.,Being accepting to someone who wants to learn about your culture will be a gift in life.,and
31800_1,I agree with you that it was an eye opening experience., showed the thought process of people that thinks differently than me.,and
26067_1,I learned early on in high school that this was wrong.,I didn't agree with it.,Nan
8300_1,New cultures/ religions are amssing in the U.S. today.,I don't think the founding fathers expected it.,and
8241_2,I think it is only fair that people respect that.,To allow others to share their opinions/beliefs.,and
20414_1,the government wants support for their actions.,They post propaganda for Americans to see.,and
29922_1,I am pro-choice I agree with you that a person should be able to make their own decision, it may be necessary during tough times.,so
24039_2,They claim abortion is the killing of another human being.,Which does not align with the words of God.,Nan
14818_2,He wants to show different races using the pictures.,He wants to show different sports using the pictures.,and
26137_3,Many people are spreading the word.,"so that there will be a future where America is truly equal for everyone who lives here no matter their race, gender, or religion.",and
23738_1,I thought Afghanistan was mostly desert.,I was under the impression that there was only poverty in war torn areas with people living in them..,and
11270_1,I now know that what makes up a persons racial identity.,It's much more than that.,so
26683_4,to every problem ,5 that arises in our country.,Nan
40384_2,I chose this.,I think this man is very strong,because
41013_1,American soldiers returned home.,American soldiers were treated as an enemy.,and
27802_3,it is very true that misinterpretation comes i several levels.,you can understand it by relating your real life experiences with it.,and
41445_1,"However, too much military interference could potentially mess up traditions.",So could political inteference.,and
39093_2,Only certain people have the ability to truly be able to identify with others' struggles. ,They can be empathetic. ,and
33348_4,It makes it so much easier to talk about these issues.,See the different points of views of people in a more open way.,and
39137_1,This story just demoralizes me.,I have never even considered something like that happening to me.,because
13002_1,We need to talk about economics,We need to talk about other social stereotypes.,and
27381_2,maybe this would change the narrative.,Maybe this would change the minds of the American people.,and
36701_2,It is my own fault.,The most I ever hear about that area has to do with war.,and
27073_1,I want to open my eyes,I may not be aware and have wrong opinion,and
19351_2,It is not the same thing as actually being there.,The capacity for learning about the world is present.,and
34337_2,Systems orchestrate things like war.,Systems orchestrate things like invasions.,and
26770_5,You shouldn't steal., treat people with respect.,and
20260_1,We see this from a Christianity perspective.,It really shines a light on it.,Nan
42288_1,Someone brought up that a former white United States soldier who currently plays in the NFL stood.,a former white United States soldier respected the flag during the National Anthem,and
29950_3,"Someone is giving you a timeline, too.",The timeline is regarding how much time you have to do something specific.,and
15102_2,Its hard to ask questions about race.,You can come off ignorant.,because
40434_3,He cannot see a better one than the one he has been subject to for decades., Bush and Clinton politics are not anything new.,because
36064_2,Basim's story was truly eyeopening to a lot of  Americans.,Basim's story was incredibly humbling nature.,and
38281_1,That was a real man. ,Someone who had lost loved ones due to the foolishness of my country's government. ,and
24928_1,I think it is important to open people's eyes to racism along with other race issues.,"The whole switching roles thing was strange, in my opinion.",so
26977_1,I never really thought how some may not go to heaven.,We push out information we don't want to hear.,and
36381_2,"We can have sympathy, understanding.",The feeling of danger in many areas.,because
25786_1,Do not be deceived.,Homosexuals may not inherit the kingdom of God.,Nan
39960_1,I find this whole discussion extremely interesting.,It has definitely opened my eyes to how I can step into the shoes of someone on the other side of the world.,and
31859_2,I think that we should have stronger tactics when going to war. ,I think we should have more thought out tactics when going yo war. ,and
30954_1,People are becoming less accepting of all different types of people.,Our president's actions are not helping one bit.,and
38614_3,he would have probably gone mad.,of all the hate inside.,because
37860_2,My ex girlfriend was Muslim.,She did not practice the religion as strictly as her parents.,and
39716_1,The difference that staggering puts into perspective shows how worlds can be affected by terrorism.,There are two different worlds that are being affected by acts of terrorism.,and
36140_2,Having the opportunity to listen to Basim and his story is invaluable.,The opportunity is something we will value for the rest of our lives.,and
7767_2,They can lead to an overwhelming amount of philosophies.,They can lead to an overwhelming amount of demands.,so
15808_2,"I learned a lot about history,",I hope we go back in the future.,and
22962_1,"I know personally that when I see something in the news, I almost never try to learn more about it from another source",I immediately start making generalizations about a certain country or population.,and
27245_3,They blindly follow them without considered whether they're true.,Multiple people have at one point mentioned a social stigma they have toward another group.,and
33555_7, only think about what is happening in the United States.,we would expand our knowledge.,and
30368_1,Christian sharia can deny you from employment.,Your religious beliefs don't align with the companys.,because
19357_1,Hard-work can't solve it.,Time won't solve it either.,and
27318_4, I have found an interest in other cultures.,I have found an interest in the way people work.,and
25532_2,We are ignorant to the fact of false stereotypes of people over there.,We think they are a certain way.,because
34056_4,Find things out on our own.,Rather than depending on brainwashing social media.,and
39625_1,These countries all only care about what we are willing to do for them.,They care about nothing more than that.,and
10763_1,"I remember when I was little, I went to visit my uncle in Tennessee for a week.",I came home with a little bit of a southern accent.,and
41634_3,I was pretty young when it started.,That's what made up my opinion.,and
39903_5,The government wants to look good in our eyes.,and wouldn't want the backlash that it isn't receiving by keeping their actions a secret.,because
38269_2,Putting yourself in someone else's shoes is a phrase I have always respected.,I have always respected the meaning behind the phrase.,Nan
33656_3,Some Christians fight.,Bring god back into the classrooms.,so
11734_1,We need to combat white supremacy.,We need to speak more about it to come to terms.,and
29080_6,They help presidents/presidential candidates relate to people for their votes.,It gets people to listen to them.,and
10902_2,The media is quick to point the spotlight back on the military.,The media spotlights how great the United States are the second this comes up.,and
32166_2,We do not practice the same religion.,We are actually much more similar than we think.,because
29421_1,I grew up in a diverse neighborhood with a lot of Arabic families near me,growing up with them made me realize Sharian law is really the same as Christian beliefs and practices,so
25519_1,It was really eye opening to hear about Sharia.,The true definition of Sharia law is eye opening.,and
21055_1,It's very horrible.,Sometimes it's easier to just avoid watching the news all together.,so
21534_2,I think the way Sam presented this topic was a really good way of making the class think about it.,We had to think about it from a different perspective.,and
40255_4,Basim was able to learn to forgive the United States for all of the pain that they had caused him.,That is what God wants.,and
9492_1,Its not a negative thing that someone has dark skin.,Why does it make me uncomfortable to say that in front of many people?,so
39071_1,It is easy for individuals to become blinded by their anger.,It causes a great level of ignorance.,Nan
34795_3,who are these people., forced to believe that violence occurs throughout the whole of islamic religion.,and
10791_1,I get what you're trying to say.,In reality it's much more complicated than that.,so
30363_2,he is basically going against.,the establishment clause saying we should bring in religion.,because
39212_1,I have never talked about wearing a hijab.,I have never talked with anyone who has worn one before.,Nan
33341_1,"Before ISIS, not all women wore it.",Why wear it?,so
40561_1,I could not agree more.,Today's media focuses on useless things.,and
20127_1,We have a rude stigma of Afghan people.,A majority of the Afghan people are probably very generous people.,because
26737_3,They say they can not go to Heaven.,"Yet, we seem to overlook other major sins. ",and
35750_1,Bassim exclaimed something.,He had the exact same question first from the other classes.,Nan
10769_1,A little bit closer to home was the 2016 election.,That revitalized the racial tension embedded in this country's history.,Nan
26887_2,It uses a lot of propaganda to influence.,They paint a picture that the country is in shambles.,and
33579_1,We never hear stories like Basim's ever.,many people do not want to face the reality.,because
32820_1,"Things may not be in good shape, living in Afghanistan.",they come here to live better lives.,so
41956_2,All five bridges were bombed.,It's hard to get across the river.,and
38623_3,They are terrorists. ,I really liked this specific video and class. ,because
23251_3,Those are the standards.,Their scale is developed.,so
25764_1,"We take it from the media, the movies, from what others say and much more about war.",What is going on in the world that forms our own perspective on the topic?.,so
34400_2,I am thankful for the security of those I care about.,It is definitely something we often take for granted.,and
34127_3,I'm glad we got to interact with Basim.,I can't imagine the intensity of pain Basim had to deal with.,and
29422_5,I became aware of different ideals.,"I realized how people could interpret the Bible, differently.",and
40076_2,I understand his point of view. ,Basim has views on life. ,and
30394_3,I'm not actively participating in other cultures.,Only my own.,because
32037_5,He talked about how Isis entered Mosul.,how is house was bombed by the US.,and
19582_3,People struggle together to learn a completely new language.,It allowed me to identify with all of them.,Nan
15396_1,I don't think I would ever volunteer in class.,I am very aware of how people are reacting to I do.,and
20084_1,The fact that he has an entire family at home.,He still puts his life on the line to make a difference for his country is amazing.,and
29134_3,two sides have very different views on what happened and whats continuing to happen,this exercise let them see issues from opposite sides and gain different perspective,because
36139_1,Women in Saudi actually has the right to their marriage.,Women in Saudi have a voice when it comes to divorce.,and
19847_1,I used to admire Germany very much.,I used to think that Germany is the best nation in the world.,and
29928_1,Muslims have become harshly stigmatized across the world.,"essentially, some radical Christians are doing the same.",so
21845_1,The video Radicalizing the Bible was one.,One definitely stood out to me during class.,Nan

7743_1,The smell of chicken soup is almost always permeating throughout my home.,I went to an overnight summer camp for seven weeks for the last ten summers of my life.,and
24084_1,Being unable to speak your beliefs without being killed.,It would not be worth living at all.,Nan
36643_5," I don't think I would talk to a class of, mostly, 800 US citizens.",I don't think sharing my experiences would even cross my mind.,and
36798_1,Basim said he knows it wasn't our fault.,That's why he doesnt have a problem with Americans. ,and
33868_4,I feel awful about the different horrors they have to face.,I believe that our leaders have done everything in their power to end terrorism.,and
22155_1,A reporter went to a sort of rally that was happening.,The guy giving the speech was translating the Quran.,and
26578_1,His daughters wear normal clothes.,His daughters don't wear the burkas you see on the news.,Nan

7907_1,however I rarely turn on the news., I know many of my friends rarely watch the news either because its never on at my apartment.,and
21492_6,They are attracted to each other physically., and mentally.,because
21993_1,There are many who choose to follow discriminating scripture.,They feel it is easy to interpret.,Nan
35237_1,Everyday I go to class  excited about the topic Sam decides to discuss that day.,It goes off topic he doesn't end the conversation,and
23655_2,I wouldn't look in the Bible to learn how to live my every day life by following every rule that is written in the Bible.,I think many people would agree with that.,Nan
42168_1,The things we have learned about third world countries has opened my eyes.,I feel like everything I thought I knew about these countries was wrong.,so
37799_1,I cannot even imagine to have a completely normal life one day.,Lose almost everything.,and
41056_1,His forgiveness stood out to me.,"Here in the United States, we hold a grudge against Muslims for what happened during 9 11.",because
14556_1,I'm shocked.,We didn't bring this up in class.,Nan
41959_4,I found that interesting.,I don't think that the city will be in a lot better of condition in just four months.,because
35894_3,"Being at school is a inconvenient time,",I have found myself praying almost every day.,and
27355_6,Other religions besides Islam have their own form of Sharia law.,Everything he said was true.,because
16100_2,He talks about other countries and cultures too. ,Which let us see issues in a different light. ,because
38698_2,it was very obvious to see that through the photos.,the words Sam had said about Bassim.,and
22353_1,We naturally dehumanize the war.,Especially when it comes to the other side.,Nan
27914_5,You don't hear as much of the militant actions taken by those groups.,you don't hear as much of the hateful actions taken by those groups.,because
11964_1,"At the end of the day, we all are here to enjoy the things we are given.",We all are here to experience the rights we all are given.,and
19815_3,I found it difficult to correctly read people.,I was interpreting what they were doing or saying based on what it would mean if we were in the U.S.,because
42073_1,I did know.,They were allowed to take it off in their home.,Nan
39449_3,I love the discussion boards.,we can get to see every ones view points on the topics that Sam has presented to us.,and
42413_4,Imagine other countries listening to these words.,People would act different.,and
36118_3, It is feasible to become, In tuned with the outside world.,so
41637_2,We do not have problem with the United States.,We do not have a problem with oil.,and
35904_6,Seek your truth.,Question everything.,and
29243_1,It is disappointing  we should coexist in a world that ,"is able to accept one's religion  culture  what it is,",and
12016_1,I didn't have religion as a basis for what I believed.,I've furthered my education through high school and college.,Nan

21608_1,"Again, we seem to only hear about terrorist attacks.","Plus, how we will get back at them with the use of military force.",and
10649_1,I thought he made a really good point.,It's important to understand why racism was created in the first place.,Nan
42068_2,This is a typical American response.,He is right in his approach.,Nan
27215_2,My beliefs are strictly spiritual.,My beliefs are not based on going to church.,and
32739_1,I come from an upper middle class suburban area.,Spending time in the city of Oakland was quite the change.,so
26395_1,This same perspective can be flipped.,It can be said about the Afghani people as well.,and
12779_1,Everyone is guilty of passing judgment on a person from just looking at them for the first time.,Everyone has biases.,because
25011_2,We do not get a chance to see the way of life that the Afghans live.,It's not as easy to gain empathy for them.,so
25576_1,That they have experienced unspeakable tragedies.,Its heartbreaking to know that there are many more people out there just like them who have grown accustomed to this uncertain way of living.,and
32988_3,we have more information.,We have more ways of receiving information.,because
34200_1,I believe this specific lecture was one of the most powerful ones yet.,Basim was powerful.,and
32948_3,I am sure they do not want that war to continue.,They wish the best for the people.,and
35126_1,People are all made differently.,many of those differences can be solidified through cultural upbringing.,and
40317_2,It means that they have to give in.,It means that they have to accept.,and
26782_2,"I don't think that I could, that is such a brave thing to do "," I'm just not a brace person, I mean he yes daily death threats",and
33411_4," a campaign of his Christian religious beliefs, it scared me  I certainly do"," not share the same beliefs him, I would not want my government to be based around loosely-held beliefs.",and
30079_3,"actually sitting, listening, engaging with the fact", there are real people being affected by this truly changed my outlook on the entire situation.,and
9763_2,The people in Thailand were content with their lives.,Others around them were kind to them.,and
34167_2,It is hard to persuade people to open their minds.,To something that goes against their morals.,and
40606_2,I have to remember what they did to us.,I have to remember all in innocent lives that were taken on September 11th.,and
36675_1,I know that I would probably never have the courage to do something so incredible. ,"I really admire that about Bassim, as well.",and
20372_1,The vast majority of the time he engaged with Afghan civilians and security forces.,He wanted to learn about ways of protecting the population.,Nan
39565_5,This should be awareness.,We should focus on.,and
26636_1,My mind tends to go straight to what I see in movies.,My mind tends to go straight to what I see in the news.,Nan
35230_1, I sat down.,I started talking about this situation with my friend.,because
40295_1,I found it  inspiring how Basim said he doesnt hate America.,it shows how kind and genuine he is.,so
37069_2,They attack innocent people in the name of Islam.,But we should not be blaming the attacks on all Muslims.,Nan
35679_1,Due to those labels.,We will filter down everything they say.,because
36151_1,We were just talking  about victims of the war., I actually saw a victim of the war.,and
39022_2, try to understand a topic.,were given a news market of people.,and
21590_1,I don't think that there are any wrong interpretations per se.,I personally do not stand for violence or hate from someone's interpretation of a religious text.,Nan
19056_1,They know we won't attack them.,We don't shoot at innocent civilians.,because
36667_5,He had moved on.,He taught me that I should have a similar mindset.,and
38375_4,Bassim was extremely brave to not sugar coat it at all.,"Bassim was extremely brave to give us an actual, honest answer.",and
21432_3,The teachers say if you sin and dont repent youre automatically going to hell.,What the teachers said was terrifying.,because
39289_1,Most of the things we see in American news lead us to believe that we are involved in conflict overseas for righteous reasons.,We want to protect the citizens of other countries.,and
33282_4,in the Middle East  people do often give these Christians the excuse ,which group the people in the Middle East  one  really they are the same type of  people,because
21333_3,You should read trusted resources. , interacting with Muslims is the best way to learn before you judge us.,Nan
35990_1,If we could just instill these values as a society.,The women would not need to rely on their hijab.,Nan
35207_1," like Sam said, there are many issues.",could be covered that it is impossible to get through all of them in the semester,so
30809_1,It's easy to understand why Sam was frustrated.,Those people did nothing to deserve this.,so
14709_1,I love to think that the idea of accents goes the same way as languages. ,"Over the next 10 generations, people will begin to all have a similar language and race, connecting the world in ways we cannot even begin to imagine. ",Nan
9676_2,Our country has become a priority in many people's lives.,A voice has been given to those oppressed such as the civil rights movement and the black lives matter movement.,because
21644_1,That is why I decided to response to a video.,The title is Who are the Afghanistan People?,Nan
21668_1,"The fact that Bassim and many others dont carry resentment in their heart for the US because he as he said they understand why what happens, happens is amazing to me.",I couldnt say the same for myself if I was in his position.,because
8902_1,Moving away from the rigid beliefs in one own's heritage and culture is important.,We should be more accepting of humanity as a whole.,and
8171_1,He had his own freedom and he did the things he wanted to do.,It led him back to the world of academics.,Nan
30246_4,"According to the American view, Middle Eastern women are deprived by their husbands.",and because of their religion.,because
42368_4,The members of ISIS have been brainwashed through their environment.,The members of ISIS have been brainwashed to believe America is evil.,and
42216_2,We know we should be more educated.,Many of us don't put that intention into action.,Nan
38784_1,I cannot wrap my head around his story., I cannot wrap my head around the fact that we do this to other people.,so
32754_1,"Hatred can exist everywhere in our daily life,that", forgiveness is something we all need to learn practice.,and
42144_1,Nobody likes to step out of their comfort zone.,Sometimes this means they don't want to defend themsevles.,and
8194_1,Many people walk on these streets without a single clue about where the person walking towards them is from.,We all just generalize one another.,so
22787_1,I personally agree with the student/,I do see where hes coming from.,and
26498_1,"Soon as we can all accept we humans, are in this together the sooner religion will stop dividing us.",The sooner people will stop dying because of a groups hateful views.,and
22682_4,I realized that every single president we have had thus far has been Christian.,"made me think about the subtle, subliminal oppression that other people experience on a daily basis.",and
37544_3,Anger and distress wasn't advancing him in his personal life.,He had to find a way to simply forgive this country for basically taking his life away.,and
34487_3,That's why America operates that way.,I feel like in America.,Nan
10536_1,I think too much in our society we judge people by their outer appearances.,We are so quick to slap a label on people for what we THINK they are.,and
34912_1,This generation should change that thought.,we should acknowledge that we don't all have to be from the same race.,and
36363_3,He follows it greatly., I would imagine.,because
30330_2,Many people who are religious know from a young age.,I'm not saying it's a cult. ,so
27000_1,I guess Sharia law won't work in a big like United States.,I guess Sharia law won't work in a diverse country like United States.,and
20229_1,Different people have different cultures and ways of life.,"Therefore, it's important to not make assumptions or judgments beforehand.",Nan
39043_7,It's inspiring to see someone be neutral.,almost positive about the situation.,and
26415_4, I have had the preconceived notion that Afghanistan is just a war ridden country.,I thought it has no similarities to our own country.,so
21524_2,There is war in my backyard.,I understand that war not only is dangerous for those who are fighting.,and
40697_1,He was  going through the most difficult thing a parent can go through,Basim found strength to let go of his anger,Nan

12487_4,African Americans are not as advanced.,Caucasians are advanced.,Nan
36755_1,"In todays society, many people are restricted by anger, hate and resent.",nothing good comes from these built-up emotions.,Nan
41059_3,We have to let it go.,We do nothing withholding all of the anger within us.,because
39758_6,I am sure it is something that is sacred to a lot of people.,I struggle with that.,and
35559_5,Religion is complex.,there is not one right religion.,so
32403_2,I created my twitter account to focus on being funny.,I focused on entertaining people.,so
35063_1,Basim explained part of accepting the outcomes of this terrible bomb.,His religion tells him to forgive. ,because
36705_1,"Hearing that innocent people have been killed due to war, even when they were not even involved is puzzling. ","Hearing that innocent people have been killed due to war, even when they were not even involved is frustrating. ",and
36721_5,it  relates back to Sam's article he had us read for the first quiz about race.,If race is actually a thing.,and
35594_1,This is something that I think any student who has gone.,The American education system needs to listen to  I really do think its important.,because

15842_1,Which is why I thought it was so important for not one,Two guest speakers who were essentially on different sides of the spectrum. ,Nan
38068_6,alking to him on skype a whole other perspective of this situation came about., it made it  real.,so
34503_1,We are frequently ignorant to the world outside our own.,We tend to believe all media-driven information is true.,and
11309_2,There are more African Americans in the NBA.,There are more people of color in the NBA.,Nan
15875_4,It was a part of the Soviet Union.,this is where this confusion might be coming from.,and
42561_2,Basim lives on with his life.,Basim takes care of his son.,and
41349_1,I think that could have been.,It was how I was getting my information.,because
8346_4,It's not a nation with one distinct race.,"It's very easy to point out every races different characteristics, not accepting it being their biological makeup.",so
32060_6,Bassim said angry was eating his up,"Bassim knows it was not American people's doing, it was the US government.",and
38447_1,Many countries are just as advanced in many areas.,Other areas are not so advanced.,and
15643_1,"The more exposure someone has to the sun, the more vitamin D gets absorbed into the skin.",They get darker from that.,and
10557_1,I thought this was a very interesting point.,I found it to be similar to the discussion in a different class about Christian Sharia.,because
40928_1,I wish more Americans had that mentality.,The news says negative things to divide.,and
34811_1,I have more courage to speak the truth into situations.,I would have stayed silent before.,Nan
15201_3,Race is discussed at electoral debates.,Race is discussed on the six o'clock news.,Nan
30766_2,I went to church.,I always thought of Jesus was a peaceful man.,and
40503_1,This made me question my theory of Americans simply feeling disconnected from other nations.,Americans are poor at global geography.,because

26860_3,I was very intrigued.,It quickly became my favorite class of this semester thus far.,and
25365_1,This flip flopping sounds terrible.,It is necessary to protect his family.,so
26141_1,We need to talk about it until every single person understands just how hateful it is. ,We need to talk about how inefficient it is to our society.,and
36885_1,Yet we make decisions because we’re angry. ,We discriminate because we’re angry. ,Nan
33919_1,Our government sometimes isn't majority Muslim.,It never posed an issue to be discussed.,and

14435_1,I think this information has to be talked about more in classrooms.,Future generations should not forget that the United States is not excluded from the many horrible genocides that have happened around the world.,so

19650_1,It's very cool that your parents served in Afghanistan.,One immediately thinks of them when someone mentions Afghanistan.,so
36832_2,I do not hold a grudge against them.,It makes me feel.,because

41205_1,This is because if I call ISIS Muslim I am basically implying all muslims act like ISIS.,This is completely wrong.,and
41370_1,I feel as though Sam brings a whole new style to teaching that really engages his students.,It allows us to take a step back from our normal sheltered lives.,and
22854_1,I would like to experience and learn about the many different parts of the world.,I have yet to visit many countries.,Nan
34953_2,from now on I am going to try harder to let anger go., there are much bigger problems going on in the world.,and
14463_1,Trying to tell all the Asians apart was going to be challenging.,They all look the same to me.,because
39306_2,They make Muslims have the stereotype of being dangerous.,We don't hear about what any radical Christians are doing.,Nan
34313_1,Seeing someone having been through so much staying so positive and influential is incredible.,Someone continuing to inspire others is incredible.,and
28337_2,We should look at Afghanistan as a country with real people in it.,We shouldn't judge them based off what is portrayed in the media.,and
29833_1,He relates that to the Quran.,He relates that to how Muslims interpret what the Quran says.,and
38513_5,Of their different beliefs.,Why are the beliefs between Christians?,because
19133_5,"They had 25,000 members.",to protest in Washington dc in order speak for themselves and tell everything they were being treated unequally.,and
29648_4,"It was a very honest, raw moment.",that I will not easily forget.,and
22543_1,I think a lot of problems come from not truly understanding the text.,Obviously how people interpret the text.,so
11971_4,It can open your eyes to understand that racists have no arguments,White extremists really have no ground with any argument.,Nan
10006_1,I also feel like thats why it is so hard to erase racism.,It is hard to get people who were molded to think a certain way to no longer think that way.,because
40169_1,Getting up each day to live your life.,Getting up to continue to live your life,and
12461_1,I think it's really important not to generalize races.,You never really know where someone is from.,because
22780_1,Those people do not hate.,They do not want to fight.,and
19693_1,The fact of it occurring has become so normal to us.,We find it hard to continue to care.,because
42471_1,It can be challenging to do this.,Many of us get our news from online sources.,so
27644_1,Islam has gained a bad name.,Some radical groups carry out terrorist attacks.,because
23552_2,They have an afterlife.,They're so progressive.,and
38177_3,That anger and sadness will eat you up.,Give you nothing to live for.,and
33250_2,As Sam mentioned in class.,People take what this book says.,because
41900_1,We would obviously care if the roles were reversed. ,We would obviously care if it were American civilians killed in a bombing on their neighborhood.,and
25502_1,Any person can pick and choose.,They follow their faith.,Nan
15067_1,I agree the no two lives are the same.,We should take the time to appreciate people's stories.,and
27159_1,Outside of that category it is the rest of the followers who are really sweet individuals that are just tainted wrong.,They are tainted wrong because of what the other radicals have done in the past.,and
34953_1,I decided right then.,from now on I am going to try harder to let anger go.,and
14570_2,I am definitely not educated enough to talk about some topics.,I do not have experience in another country.,because
32339_5, it ismuch harder to hate a group of people you know much about them.,can relate on a personal level  that is whatshisname trying to do-show us that all of these people ,because
27006_3,we are not all different,we can take a huge step towards world peace,so
36146_1,We can all learn from Basim.,He has bounced backed with such a positive outlook on life.,and
8742_1,"Personally, I believe that it is important to talk about our nations history.",I think it's important to recognize what has happened in our past.,and
30511_1,"Let us be honest, those opposed to gay marriage believe it because of their religion. ",They are homophobic. ,because
34309_2,Including his wife and daughter.,In the matter of just a couple days.,Nan
26111_2,There's nothing in their about driving laws.,There are many other issues that weren't around years ago.,Nan
14287_1,I find it interesting.,You say that about the previous generations.,Nan
38021_1,There are so many great qualities in religion.,It makes it a shame how many people can use it for hateful purposes.,so
41466_2,They make their own decisions.,They can be accepted.,and
40231_1,Basims house was destroyed by Americans.,Basims family was destroyed by Americans.,and
39690_5,we are responsible for the threat of ISIS,the United States originally funded and armed them as rebels,and
42572_1,The world we live in is very cruel.,The world we live in is unfair.,and
36634_1,We have brainwashed those who enlist. ,They think they are fighting for our freedom.,and
31371_3,They felt happy.,They felt empowered.,and
39352_1,Dominant groups like to have an us vs. them mentality.,It makes them feel more powerful.,and
39545_2,I agreed with the faith of Mr. Razzo.,He said his religion tells him to forgive.,and
27870_5,all of a sudden they are participating  than servicing the public that, the non-discrimination laws set out by their country.,and
33376_1,The big data analyze everything about us feed us the things, that we might be interested in.,and
37905_1,Basim already knew many kind Americans.,He knew not all of us are bad people.,so
22944_3,War is everywhere you look.,Everyone carries around weapons.,Nan
30742_1,"In Afghanistan, the ex-husband is still responsible for providing for his family.",I found this interesting.,and
19759_1,There are many different ways to read this text.,There are many ways to act upon it.,so
31840_1,He said that everyone should come together.,"make peace, not having fighting wars going on all the time.",and
38781_1,I'm Christian.,Someone else who I have never met commits an act of terrorism.,and
39252_3,underdeveloped war countries like Afghanistan,underdeveloped war countries like Iraq.,and
32697_2,I understand you think there are many people with twisted mindsets.,"I argue its a handful of twisted individuals manipulating lazy, arrogant, even stupid individuals.",so
42049_4,He lost his brother.,nephew.,and
34447_4, Sam brings topics to the surface.,I havent thought of before.,because
21805_1,We know that they are living in the middle of war. ,They must be terrified.,and
31934_1,I wasn't raised with a particular religion.,I think it would be even more interesting to learn more about all different kinds from an unbiased viewpoint.,because
34899_2,willing Basim was to tell his tragic story.,relay his message of forgiveness to 700 American college students.,and
20908_1,"Also, I have many black friends as well.","I have seen how badly they are profiled, especially by law enforcement.",and
38318_1,I really enjoyed this class.,It made me realize no matter how hard things may get life goes on.,and
34165_3,Will not stop.,Until we decide to make it stop.,Nan
40275_1,I come from a Christian home.,I sometimes neglect to see other cultures eye to eye.,and
41640_1,I agree with your point.,So many of our history textbooks focus solely on America.,Nan
29815_1,who is doubtful that someone today,who abidesby every word of the Bible,Nan
36174_1,We are thinking that American government did these actions.,The American government did all the actions.,Nan
21259_1,I think it was also very interesting to hear how LTC Garey talked about the people of Afghanistan.,Clearly LTC Garey was trying to understand what life was really like for them.,and
36063_5,selfish strength of our government.,it taught me about forgiveness.,and
8062_1,My Penn State friends have pointed out to me how I say certain phrases unknown to them.,My dialect is sometimes very different than theirs.,and
42417_1,It is incredible what we are able to view.,Who we are able to communicate with no matter where in the world we are.,and
29859_1,"In a more personal example, the holy book of my religion"," who Hinduism is riddled with rules  statements that, they",and
26412_1,It is funny.,Tthere is effective evidence that religions like Christianity and Muslim are similar based on their holy scriptures.,because
34696_1,everything that had happened to him., Basim said himself he was no longer angry.,Nan
29649_1,This topic interests me., it ties into a little bit of what was talked about during the Black Devils lecture concerning the Reconstruction Era  more specifically.,because
34286_3, come to terms with how things are there right now, doesn't think that anything will get any better anytime soon.,and
11375_4,She asked four guys to determine who is international.,and who is American by simply looking at the first expression.,and
7868_4,"They are only putting off problems, masking them, ignoring them another day.","A wound that is untreated will only fester, becoming worse.",and
35948_3,He says that we can talk about issues associated with them forever.,These topics are always changing.,and
33234_2,Basim is able to take a terrible thing that happened to him.,Make a difference with today's youth.,and
12481_3,Black people were physically and mentally lesser.,They held onto their hatred and way of looking down upon previously enslaved.,Nan
26174_1,That is an oversimplified summary of Sams argument.,I think it is important to distinguish the important parts of the bible from the more obsolete ideas.,and
23635_1,"You may not know of violent Christians bombing, killing, torturing, hating other people.",It doesn't mean they're not out there doing so.,because
25890_3,I was just genuinely curious.,The conversation came up pretty often within my time there.,Nan
11590_1,If she didn't text her mom good night and good morning her mom would call her and get mad,She would know she skipped class or didn't go home at a normal time.,and
32320_2,People interpret it the way that they want to. ,Not the way their God may have wanted them to.,and
42527_2,Religions nowadays are misunderstood.,Religions nowadays are sometimes used as something.,and
38942_1,peoples eyes need to open up to the other side of things ., we can have empathy towards people like Basam.,so
38072_2,They make sure that students are aware of the world around them.,there is just too much constantly happening to teach that in a classroom.,Nan
38216_3,Encourage people to step outside their comfort zone.,Look at life through a different perspective.,and
38408_2,It is still something that I am going to try to do.,I am going to encourage others to do it to.,and
39368_1,It is sad politicians accept illegal money to help their own cause., immoral that this is true.,and
38284_1,Anger can eat away at someone.,Cause them to becoem a person they are not.,and
10756_2,I think about it.,People are not even an hour from me.,because
34364_2,Try to interpret the words of ancient text.,Generalize them to an entire population.,and
22257_1,The reason is to help people living under tyranny.,It is to help those constantly living in a state of fear.,and
32591_7, have much confidence  wearing their Hijabs., have much confidence  wearing their Hijabs,so
11129_1,Sam makes a point of her tightly kinked hair.,She explains how Adonnas ancestors needed it to block the sun/ retain moisture in a hot African climate.,and
42206_1,They said they felt like they were more free.,They didn't have to care about their appearance.,because
30554_7,I find it an acceptable way to continue to help with the family. ,The couple may not be together romantically. ,because
34727_1,Basim has every reason to be angry.,"Basim could unforgiving towards America, its people.",and
35804_1,I'm no expert in empathy.,I recognize it's importance.,and
35006_1,"Yes, I agree.",The first time listening to this in class I was surprised by my train of thought.,so
25525_1,He wants his daughters have the best future.,He believes in women equality.,and
16399_2,I think of his daughters.,I think of his friends.,Nan
39081_3, it is  worth fighting more.,no matter how dark things may seem.,because
15254_1,I come from a small community in Pennsylvania.,I went to a private school.,and
37713_1,"I feel as though in times like these, its best to have faith.",Its best to turn to religion in hopes of finding reason.,and
20477_1,I chose to go back to look at this video.,A divorce is something that interests me. ,because
10157_5,America has a long history of mistreating different groups based on their race.,America has a long history of mistreating different groups based on their religion.,because
9743_1,They do not want to be viewed as a bad or offensive person by saying the wrong thing.,What one person may find offensive another person may not at all.,because
39398_1,Mosul was a beautiful place.,Today Mosul looks nothing like anything he can remember.,Nan
42022_1,We do not attempt to reach out to people who live in different countries enough.,we have all of the proper technology to do so.,Nan
37483_2,9 11 is a time of remembrance.,9 11 is a time to reflect on our past mistakes.,and
40477_4,He knew he couldn't hate all Americans.,I think that's why it was easier for him to be forgiving.,and
20878_6,The Afghanistan civilians would think of us.,how we think of them right now.,and
34884_5,They were regular guys,I saw every day,because
35601_1,People have become so obsessed with criticizing the actions of others.,People do not look at their own actions.,Nan
21665_1,Sam showed this.,There are people who are so extremely radical like the Westboro Baptist Church.,Nan
30841_3,He has a beautiful family.,He had a great partner.,and
29015_2, I agree this was eye-opening.,The truth of the matter is that religion has been used to manipulate many situations,because
8176_2,It jabs at people with actual fact.,They are racist Italians.,and
30976_1,Sam says that the Quran is the New Testament are not that different.,from a sociologists perspective.,and
20636_1,As I got older I stopped going to church.,I started recognizing the science behind earth's creation and why things happen.,Nan
34081_2,Unless it involved the United States.,I heard about it here.,and
31565_4,The city had four-story buildings.,"The bridges, buildings have all been bombed.",and
41170_3,They're based on a tragic incident.,The perpetrator claimed himself to be of a religion.,Nan
12346_1,Tall black men will play basketball.,White strong men will play hockey.,and
26729_1,"America, the rest of the world, should take an open minded approach to religion.",They should race like Sam is teaching us to.,and
41365_1,"In Christianity, nuns take vows of abstinence.",So do priests.,and
10108_2,"I think when you notice it, it opens up dialogue about it.",You can come to a compromise.,so
38247_1,Americans are fearful.,Aren't Middle Eastern people fearful because of us?,because
38652_3,I could not imagine having someone set all of these rules which are unconstitutional.,I could not imagine having someone set all of these rules which are just wrong.,and
25009_1,People get caught up in their everyday life.,They  forget that there are things going on in the world.,Nan
30088_3,The Bible should not be something people have to follow rule by rule.,People shouldn't follow the bible literally to reach Heaven.,and
15480_1,Sam mentioned that we should be thankful that our country had a movement.,The movement was the civil rights movement.,so
36004_2,He has ability to not harbor any hard feelings or hatred towards the people.,The people were responsible for practically ruining his life and the lives of everyone that he loved.,because
24510_1,I know that there is a war going on there.,I know that we lose soldiers there.,and
25700_1,I appreciate your perspective and see it as valuable.,"I went to a 99% white high school in Pittsburgh, and now at Penn State, I still am surrounded by predominately white people.",because
29921_3,Situations with unanswered questions cause people to radicalize their behavior.,People radicalize their behavior based on what they think is right.,so
38078_1,Bassims experiences in Iraq have showed me that the whole country is not at war.,There are many people living their lives very normally there.,and
38787_1,This is a very hard hitting question.,The answer Basim gave.,and
34409_1,"Weve talked about Islam, Christian sharia law, flipping the roles of many students throughout the semester."," it may not have been able to hit the issue informatively is we stayed with the normal roles , the facts.",and
15267_1,I have no idea where this mentality originated.,This lecture was extremely eye-opening.,Nan
36907_2,They assumed control of Iraq.,What ISIS did was not how things should turn out.,and
23517_1,These past few classes have really inspired me.,I want to become more aware of exactly what is going on with the war.,Nan
34506_1,I have always thought of the United States as the saviors for every country.,I have always thought we are the best country that protects those who are innocent.,and
37382_1,Most people around the world believe in forgiveness. ,That’s what their religion teaches them.,and
34787_4,the Army gets to swipe things like Basim's story under the rug.,I had the same feeling.,and
10989_1,I am from Panama.,"Every time I speak English, people ask me where am I from.",and
40586_1,Muslim leaders have repeatedly condemned individual terrorist attacks.,They condemned the London attack recently in June.,and
41164_2,I love the fact that there is no set curriculum in this class.,I never know what to expect in the classroom.,and
26405_2,There were enemies in the village.,The enemies would see him cooperating.,and
35180_4, many people were killed and taken from their families.,"lynchings,  many different crimes.",because
11065_1,Dr. Richards is very adept at making hard topics easy to talk about.,I think he shows that skill in this lecture above all others.,and
35554_3,the way we live our lives now is not how the people lived their lives back at the time scripture was written,it is just an invalid reasoning as to why people should use scriptures such as the Bible or Quaran as a guide to law,and
10958_2,I found your response interesting.,It was very different from mine.,because
26506_1,I do not know much about Sharia.,Sam did make some interesting points about it.,Nan
39907_1,I also discussed my opinion of this video.,We said a lot of the same things!,and
25619_1,"There are too many radical racist groups such as the Alt-Rights, Neo-Nazis, and White Supremacists.",This is proof to me that race needs to be talked about more.,Nan
36186_4,Possessed by Iraq., which were never found.,Nan
41818_2,I want to say you have clearly explained what a misinterpretation we had on police brutality of the Black race. ,We do not see the media showing these statistics. ,so
41429_2,Their courage inspires me. ,They hold no resentment towards us American citizens. ,and
34953_3,from now on I am going to try harder to let anger go., there are much bigger problems going on in the world.,because
13165_2,"Without questions, there is no dialogue.","Without dialogue, there is no action.",and
33549_7," exactly the opposite of what Basim did time I am experiencing hardship,",his story will remind me that I can be resilient find purpose  grow from the pain.,and
37641_1,This is the part where Sam talked about the media.,He talked about how they make people perceive Afghani culture.,and
34414_1,It shows how a country is living in constant fear of militia group violence.,The U.S. dropping bombs on civilian homes is adding to the issue.,and
21217_1,They could interpret something the wrong way.,Things can go bad.,and
26665_2,it helped a lot in making the average life of the Afghan during the war known to the outside public,Unfortunately in America we don't get to see more of that,and
38291_1, all of his friends.,he did think about family  that have been influenced by his strength.,and
14968_1,I agree that we live in a race-driven society.,It needs to not be ignored anymore.,Nan
9118_1,I am white.,I have not been personally victimized by racist acts. ,and
33791_2,I later found a personal connection to the town he was in.,It is almost unbelievable.,and
39120_2,This whole situation was turned around.,It was my life that was taken away from me by another country.,and
27322_1,Everyone interprets the Bible their own way, The Bible say one way is more correct it better than another is,and
34740_3,listened closely., he revealed facts,and
33662_6,Just the wife wants it.,It's extremely hard to get one.,and
19203_2,He said that this man was really keeping the spirits alive for his friends.,"To me, this is important.",Nan
13367_1,It's honestly disappointing.,Society has tried to manipulate people into believing that a white male is the most evolved species. ,Nan
42123_2,We have someone like Dr. Richards speak.,What people do not know.,Nan
33948_2,They are nothing like Basims house. ,They are nothing like the shopping mall in Mosul. ,and
36820_1,people should follow Basims example.,people should move past anger in order to better themselves.,and
36631_1,"Still, he realizes that American are just people.",There is not reason to hate.,and
11661_2,They were burned out from studying.,I am that person following an exam.,because
41413_1,Governments seek to better their own respective countries and improve lives for themselves which is not wrong.,We see people around the world as citizens of the same world.,Nan
29769_1,Sam added on noting something important,Afghans are living with average salary of $300-400,and
36465_2,Bassim's story made people realize that there are real people affected.,We just don't think deeply about war every day.,and
29292_1,I liked Sam's use of fish in water as a metaphor.,"The metaphor being, we are unable to notice things about our own culture and beliefs.",so
36337_4,This man lost his home.,that was built around family and friends.,and
20414_3,They post propaganda for Americans to see.,They hope to fuel hate towards Afghanistan.,because
40749_3,It is difficult for us to see things objectively.,It is difficult for us to see things as they really are.,and
25158_1,They use the Quran to help judge dilemmas.,They face dliemmas in their everyday life.,and
31772_3,we all want to just live our lives safely.,we all want to just live our lives happily.,and
28971_1,I feel the news is dominated regularly.,Concerning ISIS information.,Nan
40459_3,He was able to sit there.,He was able to tell us that he wasn't angry with the Americans.,and
9613_1,The truth is like you mentioned people need to travel more.,Sam mentioned people need to travel more.,and
28495_1,He has a family composed of two daughters.,He has an amazing wife.,and
40027_2, I couldnt help but notice how calm he looked. ,I couldnt help but notice how under control he looked. ,and
38669_1,He is truly a role model.,He is someone to look up to in the sense of true enlightenment.,and
35592_1,He cannot represent Iraqis.,"Hopefully, Basim's story resonated with everyone in the class.",and
31162_1,It is extremely important not to judge something you aren't familiar with.,This is something I've taken away from the class.,and
31791_1,it Granted we all were young  9 11 happened.,it brought up knowing our soldiers were over fighting in the Middle East.,and
38988_6,he understands that the problem is the governments.,"the government  is out of the people's control , its not their fault.",so
21570_1,I take full responsibility for being clueless.,I am glad this class is teaching me to be more aware.,and
42598_3,Helped me realize there's an issue.,"People are fed up, it's wrong.",and
38473_2,We should work hard to meet people all over the world.,We should rid ourselves of our misconceptions.,and
20634_1,When I was younger I would attend church with my grandparents.,I never fully understood what we were talking about. ,Nan
8601_1,I think we are on a point where the world is in a huge melting pot.,All races are mixing together.,and
29465_2,The law will restrict me from doing what I want to do.,"I want to fully define, live my life.",and
38067_8,He lives in our country. ,"He made a very valid point that he sees its the government who is the problem, not all the Americans living under them. ",and
20565_1,"In light of this, I was inspired to extend my understanding on certain issues.",I understood that it is my responsibility to do so.,and
20906_1,I first hand see a lot of racist people.,I first hand see a lot of hate towards people of color.,and
38838_2,These terroristic groups are spreading warfare.,These terroristic groups are spreading conflict around the Middle East.,and
39786_5,"We discuss our involvement with our politicians, often in the news.","Despite a decade of such talk, we've made almost no changes.",because
38633_4,He believes that he lived for a reason.,He used his religion.,and
23445_5,"This way, many tragedies could be prevented.", Many lives would be saved.,Nan
7673_1,i've been here 3 weeks.,I have heard I got with a white guy last night many times from my hispanic/ black friends.,so
33687_3,I knew it wasn't coming from a bad place.,I felt I was educating her in a way.,and
38855_1,This class was almost like a mock bible reading class., we didn't get into major detail on each bible passage.,because
31611_3,This has been a philosophy America from day one., I think that far it has been effective in promoting religious freedom.,so
19757_2,Jesus justifies immoral behavior by saying God hates this group of people.,God thinks it's okay for them to do this.,and
42556_6,Things are unclear with African Americans.,To make any outstanding case for either side.,and
27204_2,Yet how many times have people of Christian faith destroyed whole cultures.,"Yet how many times have people of Christian faith destroyed cities, towns, etc. in the name of God.",and
15960_1,Everyone talked the same.,"For the most part, everyone looked the same. ",and
34423_1,This is an extremely honorable thing to do., I am humbled to have heard him speak.,and
36759_3, we can be altered in terrible ways  we dont learn to move past the anger.,let it consume us.,and
35031_3,people should learn about other cultures.,this could open their eyes.,and
35406_1,I see someone who went through many challenges.,I see someone that went through many difficulties.,and
36324_4,Life is not only in the United States.,Life is everywhere.,because
33887_1,I thought about everything I believed.,my liberal status.,because
34572_2,Helps us to understand.,These people are not extremely different.,Nan

37783_1,Bassim's answer was very shocking to me.,This is a man who is educated.,and
36732_3,Both religions talk about forgiveness.,Basim is attempting to use Islam to forgive Americans for what their government did to his house.,because

10530_1,The news networks keep pumping these stories out.,The result is a huge amount of discussion on these outlier situations.,because
23059_3,They are ready to fight anyone.,Many American people generally picture that.,Nan
40310_1,I always believed that it was different.,I never really bothered to look in to it.,so
20961_1,He will not stop fighting prior to there being peace.,He believes peace will always win.,because
33640_2,I have heard similar exchanges between Americans it makes it easy, to say stuff like this  you don't truly know what it's like to live there you ,and

36525_2,Now I can try to look at people differently. ,Hopefully it will open other people's eyes to see me differently.,because

26651_1,we cannot pick and choose standards in today society,why do we think differently with religion,so
30821_1,That day is so relevant because the memory of that day.,The significance it had on our country is still engraved in each of our lives.,and

14748_1,There is no racism involved. ,The best player wins.,and

30656_1,Hearing the two men who came to classwell  skyping with Bassim really proved to me., that there isn't always bad things going on in this world we need.,and
11592_1,We counted 7 bottles of contact solution.,This was absolutely absurd.,Nan
39651_6,I was able to see a personal example from a real person.,whose background I just previously learned.,because

37858_5,Their political or religious association does not align with their.s, in my opinion this is irresponsible and something that is plaguing our nation today.,and
42008_2,It makes me think about how different people's interpretation of religion is forced onto other people's own way of living.,It affects them.,and
41853_1,The United States does not want to admit when they are wrong.,They bombed Basim's city Mosul.,and

39044_1,He had lived in the U.S. for 8 years.,He got some perspective on our country.,so
11968_3,I believe God created this earth.,God created the people on it.,and
29580_1,which books have the same,which fundamental principles,and
40177_3, we are very open,we are unashamed  talking about other people in a negative manner when they are not related to them in any way.,and

39879_2,Try and see things from all perspectives.,That is how you can fully understand what is going on.,because

39847_1,We need to better address our foreign relations.,We have to stop reacting impulsively  it starts wars.,and
41465_3,Fewer people read the Quran.,They behave according to what they have learned.,and
39681_3,I was wondering the same thing.,Bassim was able to forgive America.,and
27083_1,This is not saying that you should not read the Bible.,This is not saying that you should not interpret the Bible.,and
34251_3,"God willing, I will never have to be in that situation.","I cannot even begin to comprehend the anguish, pain, and anger he must have been feeling towards the government.",so
42674_5,They dismiss their extremists as perverted.,They don't realize that Muslims have their own extremists.,and
11077_1,That is so true.,Religious people think.,because
30761_1,They will have sex before marriage. ,They will drink alcohol.,and
33912_3,I can relate it to something more similar.,see the connection between them.,and
34803_3,we get hung-up on major events that happen in our lives., they are not life-changing.,and
39502_1,This scenario makes me think of how some people choose to stereotype whole races of people.,How some people choose to stereotype and not look at them as individuals.,and
32807_2,I usually feel so lost when people talk about other world issues that are currently happening.,I do not take the time to watch the news.,because

7611_1,We need to have a balance between talking about racism and raising awareness.,We should not talk about racism to the point of causing unnecessary tension. ,and
30802_3,The lecture made me realize that Islam is not all that different than my religion.,It's the individual's interpretation that makes a religion so different.,and
15586_1,"With this being said, I really do have respect for all people's views.",I respect the way that anyone chooses to think.,and

41356_1,we dont hear about the normal stuff,the media feels the need to only portray a small portion them as the bad people,because
34339_1,That's why it was  helpful to hear it from Basim.,He is someone who has really experienced terror.,so

42493_2,Talking about negative things brings light to the source of it.,Basims talk teaches us to be open-minded to other people despite our differences.,and
41418_6,He can forgive a country killing his precious daughter.,I find it hard to forgive a friend who was not the best to me.,and
14612_1,I think people may start comparing themselves by facial structures in the future.,it would be more difficult for people to separate each other by race.,because

36092_7,I thought this comment was eye opening.,because whenever Im around people who I know are religious and Im dressed in things that barely cover my body I always feel bad and feel like they would be offended by what Im wearing.,so
16460_1,Most people are very open to the idea.,oOhers our age almost think of this idea as taboo.,Nan
39448_1,The only media we see of Afghanistan is war.,That is why we have the negative images in our head.,so

7846_2,You then realize it's a good way to learn,We can recognize the characteristics and what to look for.,Nan
29427_2,The idea that our worldview is  narrow  people are ,shocked that  lecture due to the fact that they don't know anything ,so

33908_3,Our religions teach compassion.,The individual adds the words to your own religious people.,and
32499_1,The third commandment is thou shall not take the Lords name in vain.,Saying phrases like oh my God is frowned upon.,so

37722_1,That is something that really stood out to me.,A lot of the time we don't think of it in that sense.,because
14818_6,He wants to show different sports using the pictures.,t's not a totally comfortable topic to openly talk about.,and
29413_1,people fight and kill over interpretation of religious books according to history,people tried to use them to govern nations,because

41635_1,The way Sam was talking about bombed houses completely opened my eyes.,It reminded me that Iraq is not just a battlefied.,and
39340_1,Imagine that you were in the midst of a conflict over coal.,You had nothing to do with the war.,and
30193_1,This is why we have many people in the same group., acting polar opposite from each other.,so
21005_1,They are grouped with their country's military and government.,They seem like the bad guys to us.,and
33942_1,"I think Basim is aware of this, knows the best thing he can do is portray his culture", in a positive light to break the stereotypes that are being forced onto the American people.,and
37459_3,The group that a person may have a grudge towards may not even realize that someone hates them.,It doesn't affect them as much as the person holding the grudge.,so

35082_3, call these people out .,"what the are,by creating stereotypes that white Christian people don't commit crimes the same way foreign Muslims do.",and
39020_3, warrant checking the legitimacy of these sites.,it creates an internal problem that shuts us out from the bigger ones.,and
42259_5,every class I have ever taken just revolves around the same thing.,I think that having the class change  often is what makes it such an interesting class.,so
23693_1,We thought we were doing the right thing at the time.,The power vacuum we created gave rise to even worse things like ISIS.,and
33501_6,to do through sometimes uncomfortable conversations  forcing the students to ,forget about what they have always known  looking at the world through the lens of another person.,and

29774_1,I cant imagine.,just inviting someone in my home casually.,so
34523_4,it gave the worst idea.,perspective about sharia law in Islam to the rest of the world which created fear towards Islam.,and

41931_1,He was able to move on from his anger.,"He was able to not be mad at Americans as a whole, in large part due to his American friends that were there to comfort him after the incident.",and
37885_1,That helps in having a sound mind.,Is also good for your health.,and

22066_1,I don't have many opportunities to learn about these cultures., I appreciate having the opportunities I have.,and

37915_2,I were in his shoes.,How would I feel if my life were taken from me?,and

39086_1,I was really inspired by this.,I feel like it made me realize that its not worth it to be angry.,and
39924_1,I have the upmost respect for Basim.,I think everyone should take a learning lesson from him about opening our minds and hearts.,Nan
20719_4,They care enough to learn the language., and culture in order to help them.,and
40032_1,It's extremely crucial to view things from other perspectives.,"We have had the same experiences like people from other races, cultures, ethnicity.",because
34495_2,I have never had the chance to join in a discussion.,I haven't had the chance to learn about them.,and
30587_2,We are living in a culture where we are exposed to only the bad of other countries.,I'm not the only one that may feel this way.,Nan
40167_2,He has feelings of numbness. ,He felt anger in the beginning. ,and

28049_1,Coming to such a diverse environment such Penn State., this Soc 119 class has opened my eyes.,and
32772_2,I understand why they wear it.,They wear it in order to feel more comfortable.,and
19526_1,"In State College, I have met people from many states around the United States.",I have met people from different countries.,and
42744_1,This part of the class really excites me.,Sam is not just going through the motions when he teaches the class.,because
30887_1,Many people do not even identify with a specific religion.,Many people do not believe in religion at all.,because
27101_4,"As the government, people implement Christianity.",Forcefully in society.,and
14592_4,we all look different.,some people look the same.,so
38851_1,Some people take the bible veryseriously.,Some read the passages during church.,and
37046_2,You need to listen to different perspectives on each individual issue.,You can formulate your own individual opinion of the subject.,and
29488_1,I think we talk about race a lot.., we don't talk about it the right way.,Nan
32028_1,"Personally, I did not love that class.",I did think that it was hard to follow.,because
14966_2,They fear that someone else will take their opinions the wrong way.,Someone will twist it to something they did not intend.,and
27140_1,I did not think what it was like to be Afghan civilian before this class,I only thought what it was to be an American soldier,because
19370_1,"Over the next weeks or so, I observed her.",I realized that I could see how her ancestry made her the way she was.,and
38835_1,we read about the Christian kid who shot black people at a church,we read about the Christian kid who  killed multiple black people at a church.,and
41780_3,Many cannot get education.,That is horrifying.,and
26793_1,Rafi is trying to provide for his family.,He gets death threats.,and
34098_1,It definitely feels really good.,not a lot of people are aware about what's happening in the world they live in and are surrounded by.,Nan

37078_1,I agree with him saying that his ideas change a lot.,"As humans, our ideas change frequently. ",because

15232_1,I am happy that this class has opened my eyes to what features that people have mean.,I am happy that this class has opened my eyes to what their ancestry is.,and
31470_1,We now have to learn about the culture of the people we are fighting against,We have to understand the culture of the people we are fighting against.,and
34119_6,Most of us are guilty of one or two of them., if not the majority of them.,Nan
15585_1,I strongly believe in evolution.,That verifies my way of thinking.,so
35295_1,Theyre not all derived from the same faith.,Sometimes different things work for me.,Nan
40606_3,I have to remember all in innocent lives that were taken on September 11th.,I have to remember all in innocent lives that were taken throughout the crossfire of the war.,and
41887_1,I would have loved to speak with those women.,I would hear more about what they had to say.,and
16099_1,People from other countries know more than me about America.,I live here. ,and
33359_1," I believe that there are many core teachings that should stay the same,","there are other teachings (sex  marriage, marriage is only a man  a woman) ",and
37940_1,"Initially, just like the student who asked the question to Basim.",", A man who went through an incredible amount of agony and pain.",Nan
8133_1,Topics of race are always on social media.,It is impossible to watch the news without hearing about race.,and
41808_1,That is something Sam wants us to ask ourselves.,What have we done or heard that has made us fearful and have a negative opinion of Muslims.,Nan
36974_2,There is enough geography teaching in the U.S.,There is enough history teaching in the U.S. ,and

40547_2,It could've easily been avoided.,If the  United States had been more careful.,because
37960_1,I think Americans get involved where we shouldn't be involved.,Americans get involved without any previous knowledge.,and
40901_1,It was crazy.,It was surprising.,and
42067_2,I find absolutely incredible.,Something similar happened to me.,because
13769_1,The United States needs to find a way to cut the tension.,We should be able freely talk.,so
42005_1,Many of the men I see where Im from who are muslim may have cut jeans at the ankles.,"Many of the men I see where Im from who are muslim may have long, outgrown beards.",and
41694_3,Shows that no matter what life throws at you.,You can have another outlook on life.,because
34535_2,it was a subtle but powerful message he sent about trying to do better.,things look grim not due to hope.,because
42503_1,Everything Sam said in this video I have thought about at LEAST once before.,I appreciate him pointing them out.,and
30895_1,If I were born in an earlier generation.,Pennsylvania were to have passed one of these bills.,and
12270_1,This is a remarkable example of biology.,It's directly influencing our psychological opinions.,and
35002_1," they view the issues with christian on christian violence (the KKK , other issues).", we see the issues they have with ISIS.,and
29230_1,All sins are equal,we should not focus on judging people's action but also their own journey,and
39344_2,From the thought.,Of losing my whole family.,Nan
22082_2,This lecture was very eye opening.,It was for me.,Nan
27805_3,I learned a lot about these historically racist laws that Sam brought to our attention.,I was incredibly shocked.,and
39682_3,What he has done.,What other presidents have done.,and
27183_1,Sams point was there is ambiguity in the Bible and Quran.,People shouldn't pit religions against each other.,and
41005_3,We might not agree with their human rights violations.,We might not agree with their missle tests.,and
32391_1,"Grades, relationships, sports, hobbies leave little time to contemplate societal issues.",They don't leave time to contemplate their effect on people.,and
8256_2,It's eye opening to learn all our features are this way for a reason.,That those reasons helped us to survive up to today.,and
11662_4,It might not be the healthiest study strategy or strategy to actually learn.,t its what has helped me get good grades thus far so I continue to do it.,because
19912_1,This clip in particular.,I think thats due to the live presence of Lieutenant Colonel Garey.,because
34558_2,It is really easy to say that we should just focus on the goodness that people bring into this world.,That small portion of people tend to make  a large impact.,and
8353_1,Is that Sam is able to bring up strange or uncomfortable topics and address them in a way that is very straight to the point.,Really shows us why we are the way we are.,and
29925_3, they are all dangerous andsince all of them believe in the same religion ISIS the Taliban., they must all have the same mentality.,and
41372_3,We live in an area that is predominantly Christian.,It makes it all too easy to look at other countries and cultures that are different from us and judge them.,because
30911_1,"Somalia, Sudan, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia numerous other countries that",found throughout the Middle East  North Africa fully implement Sharia law.,and
31488_1,There is an Afghan  Penn state team working together that,to create dialogues between soldiers  civilians living in a conflict zone.,and
22616_3,We reach out.,We meet other people.,Nan
28239_2,We got to see two completely different perspectives.,We saw perspectives on war.,because
40555_2,It shows the importance of conversation.,How they help break common assumptions.,and
21636_1,It's an idea of understanding yourself and your beliefs.,It's also about seeing anything outside of that as wrong.,and
39602_2, I never even thought about that aspect of the war.,All we tend to think of in war is it is America versus the bad guys.,because

31351_1,"A lot of factors affect women's rights, abortions, and divorces.",The bible cannot keep up with it.,so
35457_3, Sam had explained what had happened to Basim's family.,Basim was speaking about what he had experienced.,and
19217_1,We have to know what we're doing.,We have to know why we're doing it.,and
22282_5,The older man came up to him.,invited him into his home for tea.,and
14863_4,I learned about the culture.,of other religions.,and
14265_1,I believe that the topic of why we humans have different colors should be taught early on in our education.,This would help the children be educated.,so
28269_5,People are not really reading.,understanding the religions fully.,and
21895_2,I listened to Bassim's story about losing most of his loved ones.,He lost all his belongings to bombings on his house.,Nan
42156_1,This scenario is hard for many of us in America to understand. ,We have been fortunate thus far to not be ravaged by fighting.,because
31226_2,Sam drew on.,It got redundant. ,and
42439_3,He was given an opportunity to learn from this experience.,He was given an opportunity to teach others around the world,and
9099_1,In my last year of high school I took a specific Spanish class.,It mixed learning the language with the culture.,Nan
9509_3, You're going to have a strong love for the game.,Strive to play football.,and
30906_2,I think our responses are pretty similar. ,I mentioned the people of the United States.,because
11150_4,We see pictures of starving people., and disease ridden people of color.,and
39830_4,It is eye-opening to see how easily we  take lives from innocent people.,It is something to think about.,and
40662_1,This post is so interesting to me. ,I think we need to understand why people believe what they do.,because
33563_2,I respect how you parents were faced with terror attacks.,I am sure they faced similar or the same exact problem.,and
39170_1,What upset me about this was the fact that the government offeredmoney for the loss of life.,"Not just any humans, but family members.",Nan
21914_1,Sam explained how many religions like Christianity and Islam are similar. ,I have realized my previous thought on religions were wrong.,so
39608_1,Iraq went through such a huge transformation.,there had to have been many families that went through something similar that he went through.,so
23126_3,It made me think a lot about what religion really is.,It means so many different things to different people around the world.,and
33431_2,turned it upside down.,we said here were sorry.,and
30057_2,who did not consider these white supremacist groups,which to be on the same thought level  islam terrorist groups.,and
32751_1,China was even angrier  Japanese government failed to,apologize tried to erase their brutality away from China was even angrier  Japanese government failed to,and
34063_2,He has forgiven what happened to him.,I seriously don't think I ever could.,because
10951_1,People can sometimes be afraid to bring up a valid racial point. ,They feel like they offend someone.,because

26242_3,It is still an important lesson.,Many could stand to learn a lesson.,Nan
27168_3,We judge things that are talked about in the media.,What they say could be one-sided.,because
29504_1,How has our society turned into killing our own kind., destroying lives that are harmless?,and
42452_1,That is why I like this class.,It puts people in different shoes.,because
30740_2,"Torture, the man being unable to have sex.",The man being unable to provide financially.,Nan
40416_1,The United States came in.,Now civilians had multiple forces to worry about.,and
20404_1,We often see just numbers and charts of casualties.,We forget that the death of 1 person affects everyone around them.,Nan
36409_6,I looked up pictures of Mosul.,I was more surprised at how destroyed the city has become.,and
8859_1,This is largely in part from the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's. ,I also think that it comes from the fact that America was built from the institution of slavery. ,and
37794_1,He doesnt have anger.,The anger would consume him.,because
41631_5,We see an economy that is not really thriving,we can help out ,and
39094_2,"The story was not a stretch, my family who lived in the middle east have told me horror stories.",Most of them have migrated on to other countries in advance of the conflict coming about.,and
19559_2,They have similar ambitions.,They have similar peace wishes.,and
23990_1,"In this new technology era, I think the media has grown to control the United States. ",The fourth branch of government in my eyes. ,Nan
20457_2,Their religion just makes them fight.,Their religion makes them assassinate thousands of people for no reason.,and
40805_1,Bassim is a better person than the rest of us.,For  defining what it means to be strong and brave.,Nan
29510_4,I wish his citing was more specific comparing to today,radical existing in religions makes it difficult for understanding from people of both sides,and
40631_6,He enhances it.,He makes us engage with the material. ,and

7954_1,"I come from Mexico, a really small town.",Everyone down there looks just like me.,and
20761_4,Many are very caring., non-judgmental.,and
37525_4,Why should I stay angry the rest of my life?,He forgave.,so
29947_1,Quran bible should not tell people what they should do with themselves according to Sam's explanation,nobody does according to the law of this land,because
30882_1,American is no longer The Land of the Free with opportunity.,Everyone is discriminated against except Christian Americans.,and
31048_1,We concluded that the mino refers to us  we have all barely that, expanded our boundaries  do not know about other cultures around us,because
40360_1,It's really atrocious that we have to work to get unbiased legitimate news., its nearly impossible to get news about things like that which happened to Basim.,and

41562_3,I agree that everything happens for a certain thing.,I agree that everything happens for a reason.,Nan
39048_4,American needs more perspective in some way.,America needs to men broken bonds between us as a nation.,so

22743_1,It made me see how similar they are.,the only reason they viewed as being completely different is the public perspective on how people interpret them.,and
37055_1,I was amazed at how he could just look past his friends death. ,I was amazed at how he could just look past his family’s death. ,and

37049_2,I had access to a good education.,I had access to a good living situation.,and

32719_6,The culture of the United States is blind.,We don't need to fight each other.,so
33287_1,It was incredible to see how he lives his life in honor of his lost family members. ,It was incredible to see how he gains strength from his religion. ,and
33270_1,I think everybody was wondering the same thing Stacey asked.,I am sure Basim had responded to the question several times before.,and
39233_2,They need to see that Muslim people are just like us.,The people who claim to be Muslim yet attack our country are not ACTUALLY practicing that religion.,and

33411_6," a campaign of his Christian religious beliefs, it scared me  I certainly do"," not share the same beliefs him, I would not want my government to be based around loosely-held beliefs.",because
35616_1,I think it's awesome.,He judged Americans by the nice people that he met.,Nan
33735_1,The way he has come to forgiveness  let's love guide his life  is ,something only an extraordinary person could do.,and

34786_2,"Like you said, his life was so normal.",He in no way thought that his house would be bombed that night.,because
21797_8,We try to help them upon returning home to see they can cope.,and return back to their normal lives.,so
23468_1,I saw other parts of the country for the first time.,I was taken aback ,and
42448_2,You will believe because you do not have any knowledge to those other religions.,You will take their word for it.,and
21087_5,I could not imagine that he prefers men over women., that he would be punished for it by spending his afterlife in hell.,and
8057_3,They may not be informed period.,that they have no right to make this assumption.,so
35173_1,the lecture was good at turning conversations around.,opening up a conversation.,and
28880_4,It strips away who you are.,Who you have the potential to be.,and
41385_1,I do think it's important to listen to the ways people subtly express racist views.,The same is true for ignorant views about race.,and

41131_4,There has been fighting.,There has been destruction.,because
25907_1,Many of the same people regularly share parables on social media.,The same people promote putting the Christ in Christmas.,and
12666_5,I answered that question.,I'd be piled into a racist group.,because

15793_1,I'm an Asian American student.,"I could not tell who was Chinese, Korean, American, or international.",and

37940_2,", A man who went through an incredible amount of agony and pain.",Directly caused by American troops.,Nan
34686_7,he experiences  many things.,He teaches those things to his students in very entertaining way,so
22279_1,He tells us that the majority of his time overseas is spent engaging with civilians in Afghanistan.,He is learning more about them.,and
26633_4,They have taken the Bible,They have interpreted God's word in their own way.,because
36644_3,am shocked by the atrocities that our government committed against him,am shocked by the atrocities that our government committed against him his family,and
28461_2,I think it is so important to out yourself in someone else's shoes,"in this case,think about the lives of the Afghan civilians affected by war.",and
10570_2,People look down at someone else.,People look down because of their skin tone.,and
38195_1,It's really a shame to hear a story like this.,You know there is not a happy ending.,and
26394_1,From this video I understood that it really takes stepping out of your own cultural bubble to truly understand other cultures.,It is to rid yourself of common misconceptions.,and
33200_1,He is white.,He does not fit the stereotypical image of a terrorist.,and
37315_2,Hearing these things made me realize how fortunate I am.," I shouldnt take things, granted.",because
30313_4, Christians have the same thing going on.,Certain people that change what the bible says.,because
32566_2,Not only that but they affected  changed Iraq more than ISIS,could by putting in leaders that only look personal interest ,and
39660_1,They were fighting because their countries told them to.,They had no choice.,and
38098_1,I found this interesting.,His response to what ISIS forced upon Iraq is how most people in America think Muslims are.,because
28057_2,Some are normal people like me.,Some simply go about their lives not judging others of different faiths.,and
29507_2,he does this some a somewhat unbiased point of view.,he himself has claimed he is not religious.,and
21074_1,Afraid of getting to know things about other people.,Afraid of how they carry themselves.,and
32686_3,It is because of how much my family means to me.,I'm a Christian who believes in forgiving people who have wronged you.,and
22243_5,In reality it is part of their daily lives., no one bothered to understand that.,because
8828_1,I think it has more to do with a regional divide among people in the world.,There is economic divide among people in the world.,and
42547_1,I would be extremely angry if this happened to me.,"Honestly, I wouldn't know how I would be able to move on personally.",and
8177_1,He states that italian blood is actually sub saharan,African blood causes them to tan,and
15158_2,We can understand other communities.,We would have to travel to see those places in person.,and
42086_2,he is not angry thanks to his religion.," he knows that he was lucky to somehow survive the tragedy , he should not waste his life being angry .",and
14676_2,I never really looked.,I do not noticed that hair types and nose sizes.,so
21332_3,Our religion denies ISIS.,Our religion means PEACE.,Nan
34881_4,anything associated with America.,it shows a lot of strength.,and
26094_1,The fact their lives are desensitized is cruel.,The fact their lives are desensitized is unjust.,and
28333_3,The next verse may justify a statement.,The next verse may explain in detail its meaning.,because
29264_6,we think about how badly it's affecting the Afghan people,we begin to realize how screwed up the situation is,and
21087_2,He is the best person I know.,I could not imagine that he prefers men over women.,and
38829_2,I am very curious how they will be negatively affected by lack of family.,I am very curious how they will be negatively affected by lack of affection.,and
42254_2,It makes it more personable since you experience it.,You live life with it.,and
32566_1,Not only that but they affected  changed Iraq more than ISIS,could by putting in leaders that only look personal interest ,and
39885_1,I enjoyed how they went through history.,I enjoyed how they went through the issues that each race faced.,and
24348_1,It was unfortunate.,My father didn't share the same sentiment. ,Nan
33248_1,I  will be sure to see what is truly happening ,not getting brainwashed by the media.,and
11484_2,Ideas are discussed in class.,They can clarify any potential questions they may have.,and
29992_3,Explanations should be associated with the actions of a group of people.,It should not be a case of they do it because the Bible says to do it.,so
35074_1,They are obviously the main reason.,All of this happened. ,and
19749_1,There are some things that can be looked at as moral in one persons eyes.,The same thing can be looked at as immoral in another persons eyes.,and
33985_4,He survived.,Basim's wife didn't.,and
23708_1,I talk about people not being able to see various perspectives.,That relates to what you are saying.,and
26582_5,He manages to have a job.,He has a new home.,and
30167_2,"It's very hypocritical both religions are built around peace, forgiveness.", the ongoing stereotypes of Muslims having a negative connotation.,because
34719_3,i think about what the real consequences of war are to everyday people like Basim.,real consequences of war are to his family.,and
16453_1,I would say that the people of Afghanistan are actually more kind and generous than the people of the United States.,We really have no room to talk.,so
39160_9,What my country had done to his family., their carless efforts of repayment for his familys deaths.,and
42381_1,Its forbidden by their religion.,some don't hold that belief and will shake hands with men.,Nan
36333_1,Bassim has shown an amazing action of forgiveness.,He is a man of his religion.,because
24628_2,People choose what they want to take seriously in religion and politics.,They choose what they let slide in religion.,Nan
32838_2,We must forgive.,We must learn to be happy with the things we have.,and
33338_2,Why do women continue to wear them?,If they are no longer being controlled by ISIS?,so
7508_4,It was interesting to hear how someone's makeup technique can help differentiate.,It was interesting to hear how someone's physical features can help differentiate.,Nan
39103_3,It is terrible to see Muslims treated poorly. ,Muslims have a look. ,because
39752_4,Made me politically aware.,and I gained a lot of respect for these women.,and
36485_1,I like your comment.,Your comment is about pre-conceived notions.,Nan
33647_1,The beauty is that everyone is willing to let you explore their lives.,Being accepting to someone who wants to learn about your culture is something extremely priceless.,and
31987_6,it never agree with the bad guys there is a gun pointed at your face., and your life is on the line.,and
42356_3,This class has opened my eyes to many more issues around that world.,My eyes were closed to.,and
8802_4,Some Asian Americans take it as a compliment. ,Really we should think of it as the majority stereotyping us. ,Nan
37960_4,Americans get involved without any previous knowledge.,Americans get involved without any previous understanding.,and
35811_2,He revealed just what had happened to his family.,This is the lesson.,and
37853_3,they do not listen to the other side's argument.,This is one of the major issues in this country.,and
35457_4, Sam had explained what had happened to Basim's family.,Basim was speaking about what he had experienced.,and
34788_1,I was so naive before this class.,Hearing his story really opened my eyes.,and
31005_1,there are not specific rules and regulations,conflict could come about due to disparity of interpretation like you said,so
26069_1,Its really fascinating to learn about the rules and regulations in other religions Im not familiar with.,It is fascination to learn a little bit about the Quran really makes you realize how some Christians demonize Islam.,and
39122_2,To generate our opinons and feelings.,Towards certain countries.,Nan
19345_1,The Supreme Court is the court to defend and uphold the constitution.,Conservatives value Christianity over the Constitution.,and
36063_3, what it taught me about the dangerous power of our government.,selfish strength of our government.,because

39849_3,"we need to start teaching truths, expand our children's knowledge of international relations.","stop spewing lies , taking part in heroification.",and
34721_4,an errant bombing., from American planes.,because
27135_2,There are people in all religions.,which will read take away only what they want from the teachings.,and
24379_1,Hearing a man who is at more risk of being attacked than myself.,This made me appreciate the life I have here.,so
26003_2,There was a question I wanted to ask.,Was he mad at the US for doing that to his family?,Nan
35847_1,I do not know.,I could be as brave as Bassim. ,and
40682_1,He had a nice home with a family whom he loved.,He had even gotten an education in the United States.,and
7742_2,My family and I eat challah on Fridays.,That's all I do with my Jewish religion.,and
15559_4,Different races of people getting together.,People should be able to fall in love outside their race.,so
32186_1,I can't imagine the pain that was caused to Basim.,It was due to the carelessness of our government.,Nan
30364_1,Its ethically and morally wrong to have a bible based world.,Not everyone believes in the same things.,because
36972_1,I also noticed that the US government is the one responsible for the salaries. ,I also noticed that the US government is the one responsible for all the other issues in the country. ,and
33833_3,It was against the law.,During a lot of time it could easily cause someone his or her life.,and
14757_1,Back to the cost of certain sports.,High cost of hockey.,Nan
20785_1,It can be easy for us to generalize.,To direct our anger at entire groups of people that have no association with these terrorists.,and
36302_4,It guided his life-path past the anger he felt. ,"His wife, daughter and other family members were killed in an American bombing. ",and
38667_1,He sees a future in which they rebuild.,To get to that desired future he has to forgive.,Nan
26990_1,But was surprised to know that.,There are many people.,Nan
32375_1,We hear many negative things.,Unless you interact with Muslims you are never exposed to the fact they are some of the kindest people.,so
26418_2,He does it for a country that he loves too.,He only wants to see the country get better.,and
41758_2,It was not worth being angry anymore.,It was only harming him.,because
9205_1,You need enough dedication.,You need focus.,and
30857_1,I would like to learn more about every religion. ,It is interesting to me. ,because
23988_1,It's hard to think in a way that you're not used to.,I think that's what this class aims to instill in its students.,and
42076_1,It is always cool seeing different cultures interact with each other.,People will always find similarities between them.,because
27587_2,There is not always imminent danger for our soldiers abroad.,Most of the time they are just facilitating conversation.,and
25836_5,It should ensure love and equality.,", thus not favoring one religion over another and still ensuring a sense of justice.",and
39828_3, it is unhuman to send bombs on innocent humans., they are human just like we are.,because
37293_5,I can say I love just as Bassim proclaimed about his family in class. ,Maybe that personal relationship of mine is why it really struck me.,so
40849_2,Instead of doing pre-calculs.,Most of us will never use again.,Nan
36028_1,It allows an eclectic and diverse society.,We have this today.,Nan
32885_1,"Like Bassim spoke about, this would help us learn about the world,",that understand that there is much more going on than solely what,and
39586_1, He had not been able to forgive.,He could have given his life up.,and
35658_1,Basim answered wisely. ,He was numb for a while after the event happened. ,Nan
11570_1,I believe race relations is a topic that needs to be discussed more everywhere.,It should be a topic that people should feel they must walk around on egg shells to learn more about.,and
38143_1,I am very honored to have been able to be present this one in a lifetime experience., I really believe that speaking to Basim.,and
10417_1,We talk about race too much.,There are no true leaders per se of the races.,because
37518_2,His story was moving.,His story truly does make you want to personally invest time in broadening your awareness to international affairs.,and
37857_3,Whether we are not.,The only way to know is to find out.,because
19510_3,A soldier goes to battle.,Civilians cant really understand completely what it is like to be a soldier.,and
28023_1,Theres a belief in the United States., That all Muslims follow every religious belief.,Nan
39052_2,In his forgiveness he was able learn on how to transform our anger into forgiveness.,In his forgiveness he was able to learn to transform hatred into forgiveness.,and
41812_6,You think about that agenda.,what will change after Sam sort of make you rethink the idea you already had.,and
23249_1,Rationalizing that a force greater than you  is on your side vs your victims is the culprit. ,It leads to any number of acts of torture being pushed forward based on righteousness.,so
38209_4,Basim did not blame  the American people., the government sometimes treats war like a money business.,and
37739_1,It is actions outside of the classroom that must be taken.,We need to stay caught up with the world.,Nan
26793_2,He gets death threats.,He is judged because of the field he works in.,and
36403_1,I knew war was destructive.,It was this destructive to different peoples lives.,Nan
24421_1,After this class I still believe the war is pointless for the most part.,"However, my reasoning for why it is pointless has changed.",Nan
35809_1,I could not even imagine losing my family due to an accident. ,I could not even imagine going on living my life. ,and
25463_1,I completely agree with your statements.,Internal struggles become external.,Nan
15411_2,They'd rather blame other factors or certain groups of people,As a way to come with their misfortunes.,and
34558_1,It is really easy to say that we should just focus on the positivity that people bring into this world.,It is really easy to say that we should just focus on the goodness that people bring into this world.,and
32948_4,I am sure they do not want that war to continue.,They wish the best for the people.,because
29601_4,they are being sent over seas.spending,which majority of their time talking to the civilans of the area.,and
39044_3,He got some perspective on our country.,Hopefully had a good experience.,so

21680_2,They are welcoming.,They deserve for people to take the time to learn that they are kind.,and
34400_1,"I, like you, am thankful for the security of my life.",I am thankful for the security of those I care about.,and
27651_1,It seems like the US is being fairly hypocritical in these cases.,a lot of the freedoms that are supposedly guaranteed in this great country .,because
27674_3,I believe that Jesus wanted people to have an understanding on life.,I believe that Jesus wanted people to turn to him in times of need.,and
35991_1,One of the girls said they aren't wearing the hijab.,They go out in public feeling naked.,and

15771_2,It breaks my heart to see how people are afraid of people.,Afraid of their skin color being a few shades darker than their own.,because
36800_1,Sometimes in life bad things happen to good people.,They are forced to suffer.,and
26889_5,It does not matter where they are from., and what their background is.,and
28994_3,We don't immerse ourselves fully in our religion.,We are easy to manipulate into believing stuff that we don't know about.,so
19090_1,I do not know politics much.,I do not understand the necessity of wars.,and
20937_2,"In general, we know that going and killing someone is wrong.",Why are we so careless with the lives of so many?,Nan

39113_4,house in the bombing to the devastation.,what resulted to him afterwards?,and
8594_3,It's surprising how someone originates from two completely different and contrasting backgrounds., or how two people from such mixed backgrounds come together as one.,because
42102_4,I am bewildered how people bluster authoritatively.,They know nothing without qualifications.,and
24668_1,I think I have always thought similarly to you.,The war was not going on in basically someone's backyard.,Nan
38668_2,it is his heart which lets him follow the Quran.,it is his heart which lets him follow its teachings in such a dark time in his life.,and
8065_1,That includes me in the small town of Westfield.,That is why we do not realize these distinctions.,and
41332_4,This was someone's life was destroyed.,This continues to happen around the world.,and

41190_4,he knew that it was not in a lot of Americans best interests to destroy lives the way they had destroyed his,he knew he had to put his anger to the side,and
27318_6,I have found an interest in the way people work.,"who do not come from the same social, economic, or cultural background as I do.",and
24380_1,It makes me feel disgusted about this war.,More innocent civilians die than soldiers do.,because
42508_2,I can already say that 6 weeks .,his class has had a much more significant impact on me than any other class I have taken before.,and
31569_2,"It is disappointing to see what our country does to cities, people.",We believe it's the right thing to do.,because
23284_3,We need to work to better their lives.,They do not deserve this scary situation.,because
38448_4,There are people who have great education.,There are people who have great careers.,and
33374_1,People are very judemental.,Instead of focusiong on how all our religions are different.,and
36309_2,I have seen how quick we are to say that Christian groups that do bad things are not Christians.,Their actions do not follow what we believe.,because
33437_6,he sees no difference in how the presidents conduct business.,they are not the ones making the daily decisions.,because
21645_3, It really touched me. ,This is not what we hear about in the media.,because
36281_1,I believe that no one should judge others or be judged.,It doesn't matter what kind of person they are.,Nan
23394_2, I think its important for us as a country to truly learn about whats going on in Afghanistan.,Not so much about the war itself.,Nan

42480_5,He understands that being angry is not worth it.,holding a grudge is not worth it.,and
33927_2,The best part of the class was the open dialogue.,People see the hijab associating it with negative propaganda.,because
22851_1,"We have always been told that we have the richest, best country.",We are easily convinced when it is our own country being discussed.,and
40554_2,They feel empowered.,They made the decision to show their faith.,because
36581_2,People need to learn to coexist.,They should be more willing to forgive those who have wronged them .,and
19186_2,It is a means of evil.,I also see how it might be necessary in some situations.,and
39994_3,We can have a more open and honest discussion about the subject matter. ,We cannot water it down by some proxy. ,so
12825_3,"without this class, I would have never asked a question like that.",but now am I surprised with the response that was given.,because
34739_1,His smiling face resonated within my soul.,It drew me in.,and
42491_1,Hopefully classes like this can narrow that divide.,They remind us to step back.,and
8978_1,A black person will never say he likes baseball.,I think that is why black people are not prevalent in these two sports.,and

14784_5,It helped with the conditions where they were born., it opened my eyes to a whole new perspective.,Nan
40446_3,The sense of empathy I have for Basim is extremely high.,Hearing his story was special and touching.,so
38586_3,What they are unsure of is thought for them. ,It is deemed to be bad by the media. ,and
20106_1,Their lives are critically affected by the war.,It is honestly unimaginable to know how they feel.,and

24430_1,God does know.,We will make mistakes.,Nan
26411_1,Some people are very quick to judge.,They go straight to conclusions.,and
42024_1,I find this to be very sad.,There is clearly so much to learn from the world around us.,because
41660_1,It is common for people to think that Muslims are more violent.,That's not reality.,and
30064_4,"I've seen this rallying of friends, family happen due to their religion.","This rallying of friends, family happens due to what is promised in the Bible or otherwise.",because
11819_1,They totally distort our images of the countries to make us think this way.,That was something I hadn't noticed until Sam pointed it out.,and
26688_1,I've very vaguely heard the term Sharia Law before.,I never knew what it was.,and
11903_1,For the longest time I thought that was just kind of a white people thing.,We had a hard time telling the difference between people from different asian countries.,Nan
16290_1,I never imagined such a political system to really be put into place there.,One system that can hold elections with voting.,and
11100_1,They are named after Indian tribes.,The land the casino is built on used to be owned by Indians.,and
40399_4,"To fully respect, love, understand each other.",No matter what culture we are from.,and

42620_2,They have to suffer for nothing.,They have done nothing.,Nan
8435_1,Sam had to use the example.,People on Twitter were bashing Hayden.,because
41711_1,Everyone in America is doing something.,Everyone in America is very focused on a certain thing.,so
31275_3,He left to serve six months in Afghanistan.,My local congressman called him.,and
23969_3,Running a country is different.,"Laws need to be based on logical, modern day standards.",and
23691_3,The media wants people to think we're doing the right thing over there.,They want to live in blissful ignorance.,because
33085_2,"There were no laws, Bassim was on an equal playing field with the U.S. where ","he could have a legitimate significant negative effect on the U.S.,",and
37810_1,We are the future of America.,You have to start small to make something big.,and
34737_3, it seems they are losing touch with our generation., they can become more progressive in thinking they might be able to reconnect again.,because
40518_2,the public chooses to show what they think is important.,they ignore the causalities of the minorities.,and
38485_1,How can people not imagine their own families.,When seeing these awful things done to other people.,Nan
33490_4,Americans  were all good people.,he said that the problem is with the US government.,and
14766_4,The differences in ethnicity stumped me.,It made me interested in how two ethnic groups can appear similar yet be considered different.,so
13153_2,It is our story.,I think this is the way everyone should think.,and
40830_1,I imagine myself in his position.,I would handle the situation with such grace.,and
35210_2,They think that person is not a real Muslim.,they  look at a white supremacist.,and
29631_3,I don't think we should take the bible's word of advice,it is impacting a large chunk of society that has changed with times,because
33645_2,The construction of the whole will take much longer than we expected.,Due to lack of resources.,and
42570_1,Many people should learn from him about forgiveness.,He is still angry at the government.,because
31931_5, the  time we get angry at someone doing something,"petty  inconvenient, we should look back to Basim  how he",so
36093_4,It made me realize that not as many people as I thought are THAT offended by what other people wear.,Sometimes they even think the clothes you have on are cute.,because
40967_2,He lost a beautiful family and home.,Only for it to be destroyed. ,Nan
34784_1,I was waiting for this video to come up again.,it honestly keeps me grounded.,because
9243_3,"For example, Asian cultures value humbleness.",Western cultures value confidence.,Nan
27584_1,"The media makes more money off of heroic, action movies.",There are new interpretations of war where our soldiers are facilitating safe elections and having dinner at someone's house in order to hopefully gain information.,so
40411_2,Then attempts to pay reparations with a small monetary reward.,Why is it not shocking that this happened?,and
22123_1,People like to close their ears and shut their eyes.,They pretend that horrible things aren't happening to innocent people all the time.,and
42453_3,"they bombed his house, which killed his wife, daughter.",they bombed his house killed his dog.,and
39876_1,There is a lot of negativity when it comes to people discussing Islam.,Especially when it is about radical and violent Muslims.,Nan
42757_1,I thought this was interesting as well.,It shows that wearing a hijab actually makes people feel better about themselves.,because
40698_3,Basim was able to remember the good times. ,Basim was able to remember the good people in the United States.,and
40244_1,Interpretation gives the KKK the affirmation they need to do terrible things  there are two sides .,Interpretation gives the KKK the affirmation they need not to do terrible things,so
23575_1,Many people in our own government make it out to seem harsh.,It seems like an old school religion that is basically traditional.,and
34807_1,I think it is hard.,we would have to own up to our wrongdoings.,and
10028_1,Its important to recognize these individuals.,They shatter all of the explanations we think we have.,because
34039_2,"Despite the loss, he moved on.","Despite the heartache, he moved on.",and
38286_3,Some allowed Bassim to live with them.,They went on vacations together.,and
7605_1,We have moved away from these racist ideas.,We have moved towards improving equality.,and

27413_1,Developments and coming up there during the critical times in Afghanistan,Having grown-up during the critical times in Afghanistan,and
32038_3,better which is deceiving at the same time expected  someone went through, things like that I don't think there would say they are hopeful about the future of the country.,because
15313_4,I would rather sit quietly thank put something out there.,people might criticize and potentially make fun of me.,and
37801_4,I thought that every word of this advice he gave was valid.,It made me realize.,because
41134_1,I found his assessment of the status of Mosul to be exceptionally accurate. ,Basim spent 8 years living in the United States.,because
33357_3,in the same way really spoke to me it goes back to a saying I learned ,from a little kid that was treat others how you want to be treated  I think that ,and
20807_2,I like your point.,The war shouldn't be an us versus them mentality. ,and
21915_1,I blindly followed the media.,I followed the negative backlash many Muslims receive.,and

42461_4,I quickly realize Muslims are not terrorist monsters., many misinformed Americans make them out to be.,and
12385_1,I end up staying quiet more times than not.,I don't want to offend anyone.,so
22248_1,They are no different than anyone else.,It is upsetting to see a lot of hatred toward them.,so
16454_1,I learned about the average Afghani citizen's life.,The lecture helped open my perspective on how I viewed Afghanistan.,and
22455_2,They were about to go to Afghanistan.,I was terrified.,Nan
35516_2,There is not a definition of how to become an American.,What should an American act and behave.,Nan
36272_2,It is hard to put myself in his shoes., I  cannot imagine what he went through.,so
9877_1,We are all human beings.,Who is this group of people to dehumanize others/ make them feel lesser than.,so
33744_2,He had gone through an experience.,I could not imagine the experience.,so
24856_1,I have never been around someone who has been to Afghanistan.,I have never experienced their culture first hand.,and
20638_1,I would hear bits and pieces of what it said.,I couldn't believe how specific it was.,and
34988_2,homosexuality is untraditional., think that homosexuals.,Nan
27625_9,They are allowing their own personal beliefs to alter their interpretation,as opposed to allowing God to reveal it to them.,and
32237_2,He said how the stories in the Quran are beautiful  broad ,what happens is people interpret things differently ,and
36555_1,Bassim said his religion teaches him to forgive.,Bassim has forgiven  with much grace.,so

25236_1,"Instead, we like to acknowledge the bad aspect of their culture.",We acknowledge the reason our troops are fighting there in the first place.,and
36236_2,"radical muslims, muslims killing other muslims, etc.",we never hear anything about radical christians.,Nan
41512_2,This shows how many Muslims are very devout to their culture.,Many Muslims view the US as terrorists.,so
28887_1,I'm always baffled by the hatred some of these Christians display.,It doesn't say anywhere in the Bible to act like that.,Nan
8257_1,"I have now, I agree our features should never be something to put us down.","It should just teach us more things about us, our heritage.",and
14663_3,He asked how some people can decide that their race is superior.,Race can't be based purely on nothing but pigment color in ones skin.,Nan
39549_2,We were raised thinking that it was a good thing that we were sending troops into Afghanistan.,That meant that we were going to be kept safe.,because

35062_2,He does not generalize all Americans as bad people.,Something happened to his family.,because

40776_2,The continuation of their personal prosperity.,Over their entire country.,and
22790_1,I thought about it if it was applied to the United States.,I thought about if a group such as the KKK was to attempt to try to follow this example.,and
26470_3,The wounds of the past could heal.,We could begin to move forward.,and
21856_1,I come from a non-denominational church background.,They value acceptance/love.,and

38257_3,It was nice to hear religion from someone who went through so much.,He used religion to heal himself.,and
33356_2,There is another viewpoint.,I never would have thought about the fact Christians are committing these crimes.,because
29686_1,They think that  you were raced in America that, you are not in touch with your culture they are.,because
20004_4,Our military obviously doesn't put that into perspective., until it slaps them right in the face.,and
38680_1,What I took away from the segment was that several people can interpret the same thing very differently.,several people can interpret the same thing very differently and neither will think they are wrong.,and
21450_1,I thought that was interesting.,"Whether we choose to admit it or not, many of our laws come from the Bible.",because
39124_2,I donI dont think we have really considered how much change ISIS has caused in Iraq.,We have not considered how much change ISIS has caused in surrounding areas.,and
12414_2,It helped make sense of the question.,I had never even thought about this!,because
34824_1,social media outlets should provide authenticity.,The generalizations are based on someones religious beliefs.,and
32432_1,Hearing the stages of grief  pain he experienced in order to be  at, the place he is now was inspiring to say the least.,and
33925_4,It's not really shocking.,It's always really been this way.,because

40062_5,They do this by taking advantage of young naive youth.,or he truly believe in what he preaches.,Nan
42014_2,They never take the time.,They never truly try to understand it from another persons perspective.,Nan
30334_1,Americans are probably not the only ones who are like this.,Our predominant religion in the past has been Christianity.,and

21380_2,Most human actions are selfish.,That's not necessarily a bad thing.,and
20112_2,A lot of us see Afghanistan as a war zone.,They don't see a place where people have families.,and
42713_3,The media just covers a small part of what happens in the middle east.,it is hard to fully grasp what people are going through over there.,so
34020_3,Many Americans think it's a destructive religion.,They relate it to many radical groups.,because

33511_1,"Clearly, there are many statements in the Bible that can be interpreted in ","a number of ways that is why there are groups of people who protest even kill,",and
27407_1,It is upsetting that you could just leave someone.,the something that they have no control over.,because
35871_3,Basim said he has many good friends that are American.,Basim has no problem with them.,and
30322_1,It is already bad enough that Trump made it legal for churches to contribute to political campaigns.,Now this gives wealthy religions or churches political leverage.,because
15446_1,"During adversity, people act completely different.",They have a different answer from before.,and
33767_1,This has been the lecture, that impacted me the most.,Nan
27663_2,Who really enjoy having conversations like the one discussed in class.,Which I feel  they are conversations that need to be had.,because
8554_1,I did not grow up in an ethnically or racially diverse community,It is a cultural shock for me to be exposed to all of these races.,so
36153_1,Christian societies often see discriminations of Muslims as a whole.,It is unfair.,Nan

41825_1,People envision Iraq.,This place of war.,and
42589_1,Most of the news we ever see about the Middle East is about conflict,Most of the news we ever see about the Middle East is about war.,and
29064_1,My parents are very religious.,I am not religious.,Nan
30227_2,people tend to feel strongly about their believes,it is something that should be talked about for understanding others,because
13601_1,I have tried pronouncing my Chinese and Korean friends names.,It just did not sound right.,and
25958_2,There is no warfare on our grounds.,(Terror attacks could have a similar influence.),and
36254_1,Many Americans were directly affected by what happened on that day.,It's easy to ignore  the full extent of what happened outside our country in the years following that day.,so
36003_7,G-d has a purpose for all of us.,since we're still here we should work as hard as possible and strive to achieve that purpose.,and
7796_1,In other parts of world different ethnicities think they are superior,They do not associate with each other,Nan
41509_1,It is different from the Bible.,All religious books claim to be God's word.,Nan

31419_3,There's a lot of crime in the world.,We don't get our way.,and
32948_2,American soldiers are fighting in Afghanistan.,I am sure they do not want that war to continue.,because

42447_2,They did not ask you to choose which religion you want to believe and follow,it was all their decision in what they want you to know.,and
27055_2,The fact is that most of us are not.,We only have information to go off of that we have been told by other people.,and

12602_4,It has become an impossible problem in society today., to solve on our own.,so
25414_3,He brought it up in class.,It is important we are called out on our hypocrisy.,so
36067_3,Many try to understand someone else's story.,I believe that things would be different.,and
37487_3,the class period in which he discussed Muslims feelings about how they are treated in society was not something that I couldever completely understand, I am not Muslim,because
35034_9,"Even with all of the loss/suffering Basim endured, he found the strength within him to move past the destruction of his livelihood.", and continued on with his live and moved in a positive direction.,and
26780_5,Which were in his shoes  this turmoil,That destruction was brought to our country ,and

39581_4,I can't imagine having to continue living on.,I am capable of speaking out about it every year.,because

39098_3,It made me deeply angry.,Western powers caused bloodshed just to obtain oil.,and
36300_5,The frictions are a consequence of Russian interest in Iraq oil supply.,Extremist terrorism comes with foreign powers taking what is not theirs.,and
32167_1,I hope to become close to not making judgements quick.,Be like Bassim and draw the line between those who commit these actions and those who have nothing in common with the attackers.,so
35048_1,"They couldn't find jobs anywhere, no banks would give them loans.","They couldn't start their own businesses, most of the plantations were destroyed from the war.",so
32658_1,"However, being able to do this is such a tall task.","The type of people drawn to radicalism are lonely, lost, scared individuals looking for a place to belong.",because

40103_2,They bash what they do.,They bash what they believe in.,and
19936_2,We think that everyone is against the United States.,We imagine that they're all our enemies. ,and

33603_3,The men of service have served.,The men of service have protected the United States.,and
32012_6,"foreign affairs, I was  ashamed that even ",the tragedy we inflicted on this mans family,and

36095_3,Have conversations.,With people you usually wouldn't.,and
38273_1,I do believe.,It may be easier to see someone elses point of view when it comes to religion up to a certain point.,because

9505_1,This particular lecture was very interesting to me.,It honestly makes you think.,and

33795_1,With that mindset I was missing out.,I wasn't learning about some really great people.,Nan
25775_2,They do not see the daily day-to-day struggle.,Soldiers and civilians constantly face struggle.,because

16340_5,They accept this situation regarding the greater good.,"Rafi is willing to put his life in danger to accomplish peace, harmony.",and
23025_1,"If you want to buy a gift for one of your Chinese friends, make sure you never get a clock.",The phrase to give a clock in the Chinese language sounds similar to the phrase used to say goodbye to a dying person.,because
34907_1,Why is it that we emphasize on the killing all around the world?,we are blind to the things that happen.,and
39419_3,When it reaches the level of religion.,How can we be surprised?,so
42056_1,It is horrible to think.,Families everyday are being killed for no reason.,because

38595_1,At some points it felt really forced.,Kind of like awkwardly scripted to get points across.,and
31983_1,There is no way in stopping that.,The people who want to stop that should realize it.,and
33148_2,Muslims get scrutinized the most.,Muslims are who we hear the most about on the news.,because

36171_1,America has destroyed their life.,It is impossible for me to understand that those people who are suffering are not going to hate American.,and
15168_1,I truly think it is because our government has not done enough about certain racial issues.,"Our government is pretending that some do not exist at all, such as the war on drugs, private prisons, etc. ",and
33072_2,Lines in the Quran talk about violence.,The Prophet Muhammed rallied men into war.,and
23696_1,"With that being said, I have always wanted more insight into what they truly do. ","Not just when they join, but specifically overseas.",Nan
40321_3,It's a really powerful method to cope with difficulty.,It's a really powerful method to become stronger individuals.,and
39086_5,Hold grudges over little things.,People like Basim who have it way worse.,because
22956_1,An Afghanistan where they do not have to worry about death threats.,They will be equal to men. ,and
28183_2,The Westboro Baptist Church is not living by this.,The Westboro Baptist Church think they are better Christians.,Nan
39851_3,the number one reason why there is  conflict is violence.,the number one reason why there is  racism in the world is  our ignorance towards cultures that are different from our own.,because
33719_3,Did they consider that their actions would destabilize the regions for decades to come.,Resulting  in the deaths of thousands of people?,Nan
26886_1,I found myself guilty of these false judgements.,I think the main component to all of this is the fact that we choose to not educate ourselves better.,and

16293_1,There are Afghan soldiers fighting in this war.,They're just like us Americans or anyone else.,Nan

28071_4,I could see how it affected him.,and his family.,and
15015_1,This is a special time in American history.,"Identity poltics, along with race, dominate politial discussions.",and
28890_6,My aunt considers herself a good Christian.,My aunt disowned her daughter.,because
19350_1,You can watch documentaries about other cultures.,You can watch documentaires about how other people live in a completely different environment from what we are used to.,and
30883_1,Maybe that education is what someone needs to be able to form their own opinion that ,maybe even join in on their religious views?,and
38734_3,He has actually experienced.,He lived through such a horrible ongoing event.,and
12226_2,Not all places are diverse.,Not everyone is used to having people of different ethnicities around them.,and
42163_1,Taking this class has taught me.,Be more open to other cultures.,and
20131_1,"For example, LTC Garey said that the man in Afghanistan would work for both sides.","Anything that kept his family safe, he would do. ",so
29927_2,It open my eyes realizing these Christians thinking of the right thing,"to them, the right thing is what bible tell them",because
20751_2,Divorce is stressed a lot more.,Divorce is mentioned a lot more than homosexuality.,and
9544_1,This makes the game very appealing.,"It appeals to everyone, including myself.",and
26602_1,Everything may seem fine now,"Pence's personal ,narrow theology will be imposed on female scientists,maybe othners",and
41337_2,"He had to keep moving, keep fighting to make a change in his country.",It would make sure other families dont go through the same tragedies.,and
27726_6,inhuman form of law.,order around the world.,and
9138_1,I feel the question could have been framed a better way.,"""Why not?"" vs a ""why do?"" question would be better.",so
21577_1,I think this is very important to discuss.,I think a lot of us are oblivious to the fact.,because
30720_1,The two sound extremely similar.,As long as no one is forcing their beliefs teachings on anyone.,and
14900_3,There are a lot of mixed-race students in our class.,It's really awesome in my opinion. ,and
40099_5,"We will see the reasons behind the choices, opinions they may have.","We can now see the way they are feeling, during certain things happening.",and
39974_2,It is a very familiar standpoint.,Many Americans hold it to be true.,Nan
38464_1,I cant imagine living a life like that.,It is due to these freedoms that I constantly take for granted.,because
35268_3,it reminded me that people like Basim,"from Mosul, could be similar to someone in my family.",so
30599_4,We start a war around people. ,People just trying to live their lives. ,and
21054_1,Seeing number of people being killed on the news in different countries.,I think it's sad and horrible to watch.,and
23253_1,There is danger of mob mentality and any number of victims along the way.,There is also the thousands who will point and say that's not my Christianity.,so
11992_2,We often believe we can detect the ancestry of someone if it is similar to ours.,For the most part we can.,Nan
8914_1,Involvement of this kind definitely made it a lot more interesting.,It also made it easier to understand such a scenario.,and
9652_1,There were always way more black sprinters.,A lot of the black sprinters were very fast.,and
35156_2,I chose to talk about this video.,I think about this class.,because

16462_1,I loved the way Sam incorporated this segment into that days lecture.,It again made me think.,because
11086_1,Only so many people can get to speak over the mic in every class.,It's a great way for Sam's team to be able to sift through and get the general gist of how people are feeling about a certain topic and gauge frequent questions. ,because
27564_1,"I agree, it is one of the worst things one can do.",You should not judge a culture you are not familiar with.,so
24495_1,Both of them have a good understanding of the Afghan culture.,I believe they have similar opinions about a lot of the culture.,and

39566_1,There are many people in this world who want to end their lives.,They lost everything.,because

15301_4,What is acceptable to post is still a challenge., that everyone is trying to monitor.,and

37087_1,We need to be in their shoes.,We need to think about what they feel.,and
42143_5,We discussed how the media sculpts a certain image.,We discussed that image is what the majority of us see.,and

31939_5,He described the destruction he has faced.,He described the family members he has lost.,and
14833_3,He really removed the cluttered aspect of differences.,He centralized everything for me.,and
36317_2,Sam called him not a teacher by profession.,Sam called him a teacher by vocation.,and

10157_3,America has a long history of mistreating different groups based on their race.,America has a long history of mistreating different groups based on their religion.,and
12285_1,"I think in so many ways, sports are the exact opposite of racist.",They bring people together.,because
36588_3,They assumed the worst about him.,This was beacuse his background didnt look like their own.,because
32065_2,Basim was knowing less about politics. ,Basim was just living a normal life. ,and
39897_3,I think it was important we were reminded of this. ,We were humbled by listening to a life that is unimaginable to many of the students in that room. ,and
10609_4,They are who they are.,", not because of their race.",and
10858_3,We better understand the issues.,Some people are facing issues.,Nan
25895_1,The way he describes how his duties center on understanding other cultural perspectives was the main draw of the video.,He also describes the norms of the civilians of other cultures.,and
20121_1,I think that the truth about war and what actually occurs is hidden from us.,"When history is being taught to young individuals, the graphic and unpleasant portions tend to be left out.",because
32877_1,The bible is giving events, which  other people have witness.,Nan

22243_3,They carry out certain things a certain way.,In reality it is part of their daily lives.,because
34832_1,This is what people need to do.,It's unfortunate that it has to be so difficult.,and
11398_1,If you are white and walk into a black neighborhood they are going to look at you as if they are better than you.,They will see that you don't belong there.,and
31063_2,The reason I chose to respond to this video is I grew up a devout Christian.,I wanted to learn more about Sharia Law.,because

30626_1,I will admit I don't fully understand war.,Or the state of our military campaigns.,and
21436_1,I was not shocked.,I knew that ridiculous information already.,because
23509_1,I never really thought of it that way.,It does seem really difficult to be able to make many wide varieties of decisions based on a book.,Nan
21700_2,They would make greater attempts to give support.,This could help end the war.,and
42085_1,I was truly inspired by this talk with Basim.,I find myself trying to emulate his way of forgiveness even on a much smaller scale in my daily life.,and

23298_1,They are not given that chance.,The people that try to encourage peace and fight for their rights are put down.,because

37553_1,I am positive that some people become so filled with hate.,They ultimately end up joining ISIS.,Nan
39003_6,they are friendly people.,not just inhabitants within a war zone.,and
40207_4,It would not change their view of the world.,since they are not opening their mind to new points of view.,and
23144_1,I'm sure these are just small portions of crazy people.,"I know Nuns who believe in woman's rights, who have open hearts to everyone they meet despite their religion or color.",because
33807_1,I think it's our duty to expand our knowledge.,I think it's our duty to listen to what is happening around us.,and
29450_5, I see many people preach this that.,do not really follow everything their holy book tells them.,so
9949_1,Meeting people who are different from us is essential.,It makes the world a more knowledgeable and inclusive place.,Nan
11332_1,I thought this was really interesting.,I had never thought about that before.,because
19838_1,That is the meaning of these pictures.,Which is that Afghanistan is not the horrible place like we see on media.,and

13651_1,There are many racist people out there too.,These people spread their views.,so
38127_2,It really helped me put my whole life into perspective.,It helped me really focus on the things I value.,and
29833_4,He relates that to how Muslims interpret what the Quran says.,They are practically the same thing.,because
27529_1,One thing Raffi talked about was how a majority of the Afghan people are seeking peace.,he want to eradicate the war in Afghanistan.,and
42755_1,I thought this was interesting.,Thought they were going to say yeah they think it looks a little bit slutty.,because

11395_1,I found this very interesting.,It's because it is completely right.,Nan
14519_1,I agree with Domenic.,The examples she gave regarding white supremacists are influential.,and
21565_2,I thought it was nothing but terrible things.,I know that's not the truth.,Nan
32197_2,They want to have discussions.,It is part of the history whether we like it or not.,because

24077_2,I have fallen out of structured religions.,I have done this do to several things.,Nan
16181_3,I believe in one of the main reasons.,How dependent people are on the media.,because

20130_1,They only want peace.,The war that has eaten up their country for the past decade.,and

20185_1,We don't ever see or hear about these horrific incidents.,"Like you said, the war hasn't been on United States territory since 9/11.",because

22704_1,Older generations just followed it with no hesitations.,They expect us to just do the same,and
33165_1,A common stereotype of Muslims., Muslims believe in a violent religion.,and
39013_1,I could tell that Basim had given this a lot of thought over the years of dealing with these tragedies.,He was genuine during class.,because
31311_2,Knowing how they take care of them. ,It makes me question.,and
8296_1,"Women, African-Americans, including religious groups.","Problems like gender inequality, racism, including religious persecution are among the most popular topics discussed today.",and

23433_1,Dialogue helps us connect to the people.,It helps us understand how they are living their life with such great problems.,and
40995_3,We only look at the extremists.,We only pay attention when something big enough happens.,and
8355_2,I agree with you that although our DNA is 99.9% the same we still choose to see the small differences between the way we look from one another as a factor in who is superior.,I agree with Sam that although our DNA is 99.9% the same we still choose to see the small differences between the way we look from one another as a factor in who is superior.,and

8488_3,Convenience for Europeans as opposed to any other barrier.,Skin color is a visual difference that was easy to use to distinguish people.,because
38899_1,"Had Basim not forgiven, there are probable things that would have happened.",He would have probably gone mad due to all the hate inside.,and
24006_1,It is extremely important that American people together with the Afghani people to understand the politics at work.,They should decide their opinion based on logistics.,and

21181_1,Referring back to class last Tuesday.,These people are like Bassim.,Nan
21454_1,Those values were passed down generation by generation.,They became ingrained in our society and moral compass.,because
33799_1," sitting in on lectures reading various news articles from class, my mind",point of view changed about how I  other should be more invested in what is going on in the world.,and
37921_2,The world we live in wouldn't be filled with hate.,It wouldn't be filled with misunderstanding.,and
30459_1,The founding fathers made it.,There would be equal playing field for everyone. ,so

38744_1,Hes saying there is no point in holding grudges or staying angry with people.,It does nothing positive for you. ,because

26446_1,Many words were used differently.,The time of the prophet is important to understand context.,so
29494_2,Which are great  people on both sides the playing field,that there are truly no winners it comes to war,and

41910_2,He said to himself he knows Americans.,He is not mad at Americans.,and
38346_1,It really puts things into perspective.,We hear just what the war in the Middle East has done to some people,and
31959_1,"This class helps us students begin to understand, learn to have empathy."," races, religions through his activities.",and

30659_1,I found it really interesting.,We had such similar ways of living.,because

22188_1,"To my understanding, this program allows students from different nations to talk about the normal life of Afghan people.",They discuss how the war affects their everyday lives too.,and
38591_1,We expect things in the Middle East.,We don't consider how our expectations affect real people. ,Nan
14369_3,It is ridiculous to think.,k that skin pigmentation is not in the same category.,and
10087_1,"Personally, from the people I surround myself with; racism has been acknowledged to be a part of Americas history.",This is only to recognize how it simply can never be repeated.,so
26159_1,There's much culture within areas in America.,We don't now what's there more than we don't know what's outside of our country.,so
41818_6,We do not see the media showing these statistics. ,You said it undermines the movement. ,because
29175_6, the Quran have been interpreted very differently spun into a negative light put a bad taste., many peoples mouths about Sharia law  making people see Islam a hateful religion.,and
38306_1,It blew my mind.,"We gave him 15,000 in payment for what happened to his family.",Nan
8494_1,They should be embraced.,They should be acknowledged.,and
8884_1,In cities you will always have people.,Cities tend to have a good amount of African American people.,and
15987_1,I noticed cultural differences in places I've lived.,Those differences would probably stand out more to you than me.,and
34493_1,people were to really try to connect with one another., understand what each person goes through.,and
29927_1,When Sam showed those groups and talked about Charlottesville,It open my eyes realizing these Christians thinking of the right thing,Nan

39551_3,I feel horrible.,Wish there was something we could do.,and
7559_1,We should all love what we were born with.,It shows us about our ancestry.,because
15352_1,Many people think that race goes hand in hand with other genetic factors that make up a person's traits.,"In reality, it has nothing to do with that at all.",and
28817_3,Promote peace.,Promote love.,and

15819_5,I have seen the tans that some Italians get., Sam kinda just put it into to context better.,because

41899_1,It is hard to see that our country has caused so much hurt to innocents. ,I think more people should be made aware of it.,Nan
24542_1,It made me think of my family.,I cant even imagine what it would be like to grow up in a war zone.,and
20342_2,This is from watching the news.,This is from only seeing one angle.,Nan
23508_1,Every aspect of an individual's life is supposed to be dictated by the words in that book.,People make interpretations of those words.,and
19660_1,He faced daily threats.,He is doing the peace movement.,because
29271_1,When I was growing up I always noticed different races had different kinds.,I didnt really why.,Nan
31811_1,"Meanwhile, the hate and violence committed by the KKK is something Christians do not worry about.",They claim the KKK members are not actual followers of Christianity.,because
31854_5,Christians do the same thing.,follow a book that has many different interpretations to different people.,and
37308_3,I just think of  my hometown.,what it would be like to have it all gone?,and

27199_2,We don't get the full picture of what happened.,We get poverty.,because
39751_1,I never had the chance to think about how these women feel.,In society there are mostly non-hijab wearing people.,Nan
38000_3,Who are we to judge their beliefs., we don't believe in what they do.,and
31964_2,it decreases our ability to have empathy for others who we may fear,we do not fully know and understand them,because
16138_1,It gave us some background on his life.,I truly reinforced Rafi is a person just like any of us.,because
34197_1,There is a definite pattern emerging as I spend more  time in this course.,that is the knowledge that my previous schooling has failed to educate me on these important topics.,and
8343_1,We live in America.,More of the minorities features are considered abnormal.,because
28376_4,Conservative religious views prohibit homosexual marriage.,Conservative religious views prohibit a few other major beliefs.,and
29602_2,Doing this gets the American soldiers more familiar with a certain country's culture.,Doing this allows the citizens of the foreign country to build up trust with the Americans.,and

34766_1,I did not know the severity of things going on over there.,We may look at misfire as no big deal.,and
8635_1,We need to have an open diaglogue.,Understand what people are going through.,and
34888_1,"Initially, I thought they wore the Hijabs.",it was written in the Quran.,because

32997_4,see you in a certain way.,you have to see them in the same way.,Nan

33684_1,People generalize Muslims.,Most Americans don't know much about Islam.,because

31297_1,But in reality both the books are very similar.,Quran is used to establish a system of law unlike the bible.,Nan
35614_4,Basim being able to be at peace with Americans.,taking into account what they did to his family.,and
35532_1,You are allowed to.,Encouraged to follow whatever relition you like.,and

31656_1,The same comments were being repeated.,It did not make the arguments as powerful.,and
31780_3,We don't give things much thought.,It's really depressing to think about how our nations actions affect others. ,because
31525_1,I understand that people can like a candidate due to their religion.,It's not like they would be able to bring any of the aspects of that religion into their position in the government.,Nan
36724_2,It is easier to take the human out of others different than us. ,It's easier than getting to actually know the other person.,because
30715_1,I find this to be strange.,"In Ohio State if the same situation occrued, the wife must wait 7 years.",because
42741_2,It is one of the worst things people can experience.,Basim is able to forgive this.,and
30863_2,People will read what they want.,They do not want to hear the truth. ,because
35979_3,Showing no matter how bad it can be done.,We are essentially one in the same.,and
28531_1,Kids continuously struggle to get to their schools.,Education is being highly affected.,so
33259_1,There was another time during this class where Sam discussed these ,"readings  being against oral sex  other things that made the class laugh, it really ",and
14497_1,It is absolutely undeniable.,Police brutality has always existed.,Nan
35394_2,He would still be living in anguish.,Over the loss of his family.,Nan

33966_3,There are so many that share my beliefs.,I would be ignorant to deny the views of one just to conform to another.,and

42261_3,Christians kill Christians.,He made a great point.,and
34429_3,That was the old lady's advice.,always vote.,so
35904_2,Be able to have empathy.,Seek your truth.,and
15458_3,It is founded on the genocide of its natives and those who worked to maintain it., enslavement of its natives and those who worked to maintain it.,and

34002_1,we are  quick to point fingers at radicals.,radicals claim to be Muslim.,so
40366_3,This class is the only way I got to hear of Bassim's story.,I am glad for Sam Richards and Soc 119.,and
20905_1,I think it is important to become involved.,I think it is important to understand global issues.,and
36508_1,I hope that we can learn from this.,I hope we vote for candidates.,and
38603_3, that is always the way things have been.,there were other just flat out outrageous lines from both sides.,and
7518_1,The way our parents were raised.,The way our grandparents were raised.,and
38637_1,I was actually shocked by this.,Ive never heard of someone wanting to go back to the place where their life was practically taken from them.,because
20601_1,People should stop deciding what traits are superior.,They should understand them biologically.,and
33118_3,Basim tied to convince us that life isn't all bad in Afghanistan.,Many people live what we perceive to be normal lives.,and
19182_4,They discuss their differences., especially in a war like this.,Nan
41573_4,I tend to block things out that are unjust.,They're changing the world.,because
38222_5,This event could happen to anyone.,it is a very tragic event.,and
10163_2,We have not addressed these things.,"In other places, this is not the case.",and
9069_1,I wanted to really connect with them.,I wanted to let them know I cared.,and
24618_2,I know there is a part of my family that looks at my friends a little funny.,I know there are plenty of others who would look down on my friends for who they are.,Nan

15745_1,I like bright colors and a lot of designs.,They have more simple clothes with solid colors.,and
11991_1,I found this really interesting as well.,I started to wonder what little traits relate back to my ancestry.,and
41698_2,I wanted to write on the same lecture.,I wanted to due to the fact that I found this class to be a certain thing.,because
28768_2,There are attempts of people to implement Christian sharia.,Those people do not have much luck doing so.,and
38264_3,If more people were not holding grudges that are already passed.,If more people were looking into the future,and
38222_4,It put something into perspective.,This event could happen to anyone.,and
33627_1,This lecture introduced the idea.,"All religions in general, interpret their beliefs differently.",Nan
26614_1,Christians try to impose their interpretation of the bible on others.,Islamic extremists like ISIS and Al-Quada try to impose their interpretation of the Quran on others.,and
33292_1,I was glad that I got to hear Basim speak about his lifestyle.,The  way that he goes through his life every day.,and
21839_1,It is sad.,We are having this war.,because
27322_5, The Bible say one way is more correct it better than another is, The Bible is subjective ,so
32707_1,"hearing Bassim's story  how he lost his wife, daughter",nephew I truly didn't understand why he wasn't angry at the US,and
36931_3,Seeing Basim put that into action makes me want to live my life to be more like that as well. ,"If someone can forgive something that awful, everyone should be able to forgive.",because

42263_1,I also liked how Sam talked.,He talked about the purpose of the class.,Nan

35214_3,He lost his house,a bomb that the United States misplaced.,because
15504_1,Logical thinking would lead you to believe that race shouldn't be such a huge issue.,Let alone in the year 2017.,Nan
8207_1,I like the way Sam showed that ultimately Christianity and Sufism talk about the same thing.,Reducing one's ego to become one with god.,Nan
32511_1,He says his religion taught him to forgive.,He uses religion to guide his life.,and
8412_1,In society most people are taught you can't be evil.,They don't act on the message they were fed.,so
28271_6,It was weird that the church started receiving rights to refuse a gay marriage.,People decided to pay more attention to one part of the passage.,because
19546_1,Culture is a huge part of our livelihood. ,It is how we communicate with one another. ,and

35449_5,His religion helps calm him.,not put the hatred on to Americans.,and
33900_1,We must be more willing to discuss the problems happening within the country.,They can be fixed. ,so

19351_1,It is used to virtually visit the world's museums.,It is not the same thing as actually being there.,and
36042_1,I would probably be very angry.,Bassim has been able to cope with his loss.,so

27728_3,we are quick to judge and talk about lack of freedom for women,some of our laws are even more extreme,because

29524_11,soldiers die i think they are ( religiously uneducated like you said )  just adding their little racist flare into the mix which  does reflect christian ,beliefs into a good light and makes Christianity as a whole more like an extreme religion where if you break one sin you have no chance of salvation .,and

41441_2,It’s still used for its intended purpose.,I would say that it’s mostly used negatively.,Nan
26057_1,This can be seen in other places in the world where Christianity was thought to save people.,They forcibly made people convert instead of making it a choice.,and
29144_1,I still have strong faith till this day,"however, taking every word from book written thousands of years ago does not make any sense",Nan
27793_3, I was fascinated by the lecture regarding Southern American ., Asian facial features with the historical events that attempt to explain.,and
24986_1,Diversity with peoples upbringings is not at all a bad thing.,There is no one culture.,because
15194_1,It is a solid mix of both.,This should not be the case.,and
11297_1,It's interesting to think about.,"Nevertheless, it is definitely a reality in today's sports.",Nan
39092_3,Pity the misfortunes.,Stories they hear about other people.,and
40474_4,It ruined your life.,"then left you with 2,000 dollars in return.",and
27712_1,Who said your brother is gay,That it's kind of taboo Catholics to talk about like,and
28901_4, Soldiers  the initial invasion is over both, branches do the same things.,and
20198_1,I had never truly seen what Afghanistan looked like.,I had only seen only images of war torn cities or pictures of the desert or mountains.,Nan
34490_2,There is still a small amount that is.,Racial prejucide is surprisingly still a part of our country.,and
42616_2,I totally agree with it.,Its going to take a whole lot of effort to turn things back around when you are just an individual.,and
41826_1,"If we took the time to stop generalizing this country, maybe we could come to terms with their culture. ","If we took the time to stop generalizing this country, maybe we could come to terms with their way of life. ",and
38057_3,I have had many interactions with other students.,They make it quite obvious that there can sometimes be limited knowledge.,and
16165_1,"There is awkwardess, even an uncomfortable feeling of talking about race, it needs to be eased.","Easing it, we could all come to terms with the differences.",so
10479_1,It requires all sorts of equipment.,It isn't always accessible at public schools.,and
22811_1,"However, if you go to the country or talk to someone who is from the country, you get a different perspective.",You get a feel for those that live in a country where there is a lot that families and civilians have to endure on a daily basis.,Nan
27940_2, I'm thankful that he shared his story with us.,"To help us learn more about his country, city and his life.",and
32951_1,We talk about Muslim terrorists like ISIS.,We associate them with the religion of Islam.,and
29426_1,There is a thing that we call terrorism.,"There are acts that are of the same kind, however.",Nan
31299_4,How could everyone have the same opinions?,How could everyone agree on a book?,and
36956_4,He is using his experience to educate others.,I respect Bassim very much.,and
19953_4,Bassim was living a normal life.,"lost his light, his daughter and wife, because of an accidental bomb.",and
42623_3,He enjoyed life here.,He loved Iraq much he went back.,and
14499_1,They get blasted on CNN.,They get blasted on MSNBC.,and
39003_1,To be able to hear from a man who lives in a war zone., people who live far away are truly very similar to myself.,so
22724_2,To educate oneself.,To make better opinions for themselves.,Nan
20412_1,It's our responsibility to make sure we stay informed outside of traditional media,We can have a better understanding of the world around us.,so
23221_1,He was working with the people.,He was trying to help.,and
19254_1,This opportunity is relatively new to humans.,"Looking at human history, it has never been easier to travel.",Nan
10743_1,The conversation  continued.,I realized just  how deep the United States racial problems are.,and
34714_2,Women who wear burqas do not care.,women who show off their bodies do  is they want to.,because
39526_4,"people should put themselves in the shoes of the poor, oppressed , judged",it is  easier for them to understand how life could be different.,because
12361_2,In the sense that men want  to try something once but never really end up actually trying it.,Dating outside their race.,Nan
35404_1,This interview was with Basim.,Perhaps it was the closest we could ever get,and
40256_1,I did miss class one day on a Tuesday.,This is that class.,so
15385_1,I think.,We try to be funny online. ,Nan
36261_1,I appreciate his honesty towards the questions that were asked.,I admire his strength experiencing such an imaginable tragedy that he did,and
34786_3,He in no way thought that his house would be bombed that night.,It showed how quickly something can be taken away from you.,and
41181_1,Bassim is able to separate the thoughts of the American people.,Bassim is able to separate the thoughts of the government.,and
19433_1,Sam did a really good job at showing what it really looks like to live in these places.,I think it is an aspect of war we are truly sheltered from. ,and
33173_3,The Bible says to forgive.,We are not quick to listen to those words to do exactly that.,and
12710_1,"When hockey originally became popular, it was obvious that a lot of equipment would be needed.","The only way you could play the sport was in the cold, considering it is on ice.",and
41107_1,I'm a black male.,People continually assume I'm supposed to act or look a certain way when they meet me.,and
16078_1,Here's the biggest thing I personally took away from Rafi talking.,Most of the people that are living in Afghanistan are peaceful and friendly.,Nan
20674_1,My family goes to church every Sunday.,That's always how it's been.,and
8306_1,"When there isnt a severe cultural topic backing something, it can be boring",It can be hard to swing a following for the research,and
28823_2,You have to bring the girl back home.,You have to see how your parents react to the situation.,and
38006_1,He had everything taken away from him.,The United States military made an error in where to drop the bomb that day.,because
19921_2,Sam did a really good job of providing real life images of Afghan society like Rafis family.,Sam provided real life images of the traffic jams in Afghanistan. ,Nan
22371_1,The process is one of dialogues with people from different parts of the world.,It is exchanging ideas about peace.,and
36053_6,We immediately link the perpetrators to islam. ,We seem to wrongly blame this religion.,and
29753_1,We only see/hear about the extremists.,They are the people who do the things making the news.,because
41974_1,I think this hit hard for me.,we saw photographs of Bassim in America.,because
40559_1,Advertising and media has guided our culture to believing in this idea.,We need to be happy and content at all times in our lives.,Nan
32485_3,You must be extremely devout.,You must be pure.,and
25363_1,I really felt for this man.,Throughout his life he has had a variety of groups try to come into his city and take it over.,because
35329_1,The media has so much power in our society today.,They have the power to brainwash people with their headlines.,and
21322_1,I'm not happy.,I want someone else.,because
9229_1,You have such a strong accent.,One time someone was like are you from Argentina?,Nan
33837_5,they are not okay with homosexuality.,God made man.,so
28362_3,I agree with what he is saying.,Christians are moving towards Sharia law.,and
32133_1,"At first, I did not comprehend what he meant.",I grew up in the United States.,and
34706_6,I never thought about it thoroughly.,the two seem inseparable in the way they're covered.,and
15499_3,Your country is founded on genocide.,Your country is founded on the natives' enslavement.,and
23225_1,These people who died fighting a war in some other land.,It made me see how real these types of things actually are.,and
33481_2,he would have kept refreshing the bad memory.,make his emotion even worse.,and
33372_2,It is always good to understand someone else's.,See where they are coming from.,and
26896_1,It never comes to my attention.,I always forget that there are actual real people,and
39065_1,I found something really sad.,We never saw his story on the news.,Nan
36032_1,Jesus did not go to the people who were well liked and accepted in society.,He went to the outcast.,and
34318_1,I agree that what happened to Bossims family was unfair., I could not imagine the type of pain that he lives with every day.,and
31922_4,Everything he loved in his life was taken from him.,Our government's mistake took those things from him.,because
42379_5,They have personal choices of when to wear it.,or even if they shake hands with men.,and
20448_1,People are not born evil.,People have the capacity to change.,and
26136_2,"Rather than open up and fix internal problems, they switch the focus around to how bad things are over here.",what other countries don't realize is this open communication about racism taking place here in the U.S. is going to be the thing that eventually solves our race issue.,Nan
41722_1,I think a certain thing is remarkable.,It's remarkable that the kindness of someone can do something.,Nan
36461_3,He talked about it like it wasnt overall a big deal.,His life was in danger on a daily basis due to them.,and
40561_2,Today's media focuses on useless things.,It was eye opening to see Bassims.,and
19229_1,It's thought provoking.,It's cool to hear that you came from a class with only 130 students.,and
30700_1,Not only are black people's grievances legitimate and justified.,There's a reason they're grieving in the first place.,because
38923_8,There are Americans who hate him., he is Muslim.,because
19695_1,Getting to hear Rafi talk in class and seeing his innocent daughters was an eye opener.,It certainly has at least some of the students of soc 119 thinking a little more about the war in Afghanistan.,and
37543_1,He mentioned how he had been severely depressed and angry.,He never thought he would forgive the U.S government for what they had done to him.,and
40595_1,I believe this is a very lazy way of thinking.,This is why so much racism and prejudice exists.,Nan
21817_1,They show what you want to teach specific groups.,Nowadays society focuses on the negativity.,and
39841_2,We bombed Mosul.,"We bombed Mosul,a war that we started ,it makes me sick.",and
38956_1,My friends kept me updated on the fighting.,my friends kept me updated on the culture that they witness there.,and
39176_3,Bassims response was shocking to me.,He recalls that he was numb at first.,because
41035_1,"When I was younger, I would ask my mom how can people like the KKK call themselves Christians?",I would ask her how can other hate groups call themselves Christians? ,and
9724_1,It is interesting to think about ancestry/ how people have become who they are today.,It is important to respect that.,and
38229_3,"I imagine they patrolled the streets likewise to how American soldiers do in Iraq,",I wouldnt know how to live,and
19246_1,It is a journey of astonishment.,The experience of traveling and learning about new places and cultures culminates in multiple epiphanies.,Nan
24300_1,We lump all Muslims together.,We hate them for actions of Muslim extremists.,and
28255_2,They have aspirations they want to fulfill.,It is especially difficult for them,and
7847_1,Really noticing the small things about the way people look.,Linking that with their ancestry gives us a tool to better understand the slight differences among us.,and
41471_1,Of course there are a lot of similar things we need in life.,In the end some people have things that others don't.,Nan
41360_1,Those examples do not represent what the faith is about.,Speaking to someone who is Muslim will educate people the correct way.,and
33849_1,That is why I am  deeply engaged on Sam Richards class ,which I feel like he gives us knowledge that goes beyond the textbooks.,so
40790_1,I have heard statistics about the number of civilians the U.S. armed forces have killed.,Talking to someone affected by it makes it much more real.,so
37074_1, Basim had suffered.,Bassim lost is something that would break people.,and
20399_1,We would relate more to them.,To be against the bombings more so than we are currently.,and
33630_1,I agree with your response.,We hear sometimes about what happens overseas to civilians. ,Nan
31992_4, they really want to take over Taiwan they can easily bomb us.,destroy the island within minutes.,and
35401_1,Basims his attitude was incredibly respectable.,It was hard to imagine a man happy being the exact opposite.,so
21407_1,I agree.,This is the first step to making America a more comfortable space.,Nan
20678_1,It really does make me question.,What Bible are you reading.,Nan
30752_3,We value hope.,It is different from how radical Christians interpret the Bible.,and
36913_3,Unfortunately this man was affected by it like no other losing his wife,Losing his child which is a tragedy.,and
37418_1,I am really glad that in our classroom we get to talk about Muslim.,"Through discussing their culture and their society, the idea of them changed a lot.",because
9513_3,The video talks about racial inequality in Venezuela.,The video talks about racial inequality in Colombia.,and
32508_2,His brother's house was destroyed.,Mosul's wife was killed.,and
29579_1,Sam indirectly pointed out all those flaws throughout classes,The Quran and Bible are similar and are reasons for all the problems in our world today,so
42497_2,today my very best friends are Jewish,my boyfriend is Jewish.,and
32907_4,I won't think poverty.,but something positive that actually reflects the country and everything it stands for.,and
9329_1,I think you have a very interesting point.,You said it depends on the sports stars in your area.,Nan
31902_3,It was an eye-opening experience to learn their stories.,I felt like I was taught a lot that day.,and
40309_2,He showed people.,He showed shopping malls.,and
20458_1,People believe that Muslims are just aggressive bombs.,Bombs are just waiting for the right place and time to explode.,Nan
31027_2,My roommate is Muslim.,Half of my friends are either Jewish people or Buddhists.,and
33374_2,Instead of focusiong on how all our religions are different.,We need to look at how they are similar.,and
32050_2,The religion is a way to live your life everyone needs to practice.,Which the same things do the same things,and
37852_3,I think it speaks to how we need to be more open minded.,It speaks to how we need to accept other viewpoints.,and
8202_4,God is a creator of life.,Women give birth.,so
42671_2,Imagine making only four dollars a day.,Imagine trying to feed yourself.,and
37947_1,Basim has lived in America. ,Basim has understood that we arent bad people.,and
16324_1,I distinctly remember this conversation happening in class.,It resonated with me.,because
30187_3,It is compared to cultures worldwide,the view of the current administration is America first,and
27499_5,Who begin to explain the similarities.,That  i did not believe it.,Nan
11144_3,There are countries beating us by landslices in academia.,Some countries beat us in medical progress.,so
38446_1,This is a common misconception that most people have about other countries.,It is mainly due to what they are exposed to from the media.,because
33250_3,People take what this book says.,They interpret it in their own ways.,and
32916_3,learn about their culture,better appreciate these people ,and
29243_5,"is able to accept one's religion  culture  what it is,", but people would  put labels on things  of their opinion.,because
40555_3,It shows the importance of conversation.,How they help break common assumptions.,because
40713_3,I think it is amazing how he feels no resentment.,I think it is amazing how he feels no anger when he has every right to feel that way.,and
33253_1,I think it boils down to the person., they choose to translate.,and
42074_2,Interesting to hear a group of females wearing hijabs answering questions from girls without hijabs.,I do not know about everyone else.,because
36069_5,to see that we are not different.,people have problems just very similar.,and
14950_1,Race is very hard to talk about.,It offends most people.,and
20568_3,I can further my knowledge about them.,I want to continue through my own investigation.,and
26515_2,I could make an argument.,Radicals are following a perverted version of their religion.,and
36507_2,They need to work on actions that could improve relations with the middle east. ,They need to stop harming the everyday and normal families. ,and
42068_4,He is right in his approach.,The people had nothing to do with it.,because
28188_1,It makes sense.,A lot of times in our own culture we do not see outside of our culture.,because
30039_2,the book had to stay the same.,the no matter what shit it has in it.,Nan
30617_6,It is hard to relate to his hardships.,Where I was born made me lucky.,and
14914_1,They claimed it as their own.,They killed.,and
39909_1,I was self reflecting.,I never just sat.,and
31716_1,"No matter what he has been through, he wants to be himself.",He wants to be there for his son.,and
42078_2,He had so much taken away from him.,How can he can forgive so easily?,Nan
39158_3,war war countries like Afghanistanlike Afghanistan.,underdeveloped war countries like Iraq.,and
39643_1,I heard this.,My mind was racing a mile a minute.,and
22355_1,Those numbers should be more publicized.,More people would step up to speak out against the war.,and
41117_1,I completely agree with your argument.,I agree that kids will probably not care about wars.,and
40523_1,The problems that we all have daily are minuscule compared to other people.,Our problems are nothing compared to the problems these people deal with daily.,and
32311_2, very proud to be wearing them., the topic does arise- there is usually a controversial feminism attack.,and
29463_2,I agree that there will be less crime.,Sharia law's punishment is severe.,because
28134_1,At that time Ronald Reagan was the president.,"Under the Reagan Doctrine, he believed that he must fight the Soviet Unions red scare at all cost.",and
16232_1,There are many that believe you need to be tall.,Many believe you need to be quick.,Nan
24964_1,It made me think about the other side.,The side that we don't see on the news or don't hear about.,and
39892_3,This dynamic would provide insight to some of the thoughts students face.,Students struggle here at Penn State.,and
21199_1,He described the people as very generous.,It made it all seem very real to me.,and
40301_2,He went through stages that helped him cope.,He coped with the horrible situation.,Nan
40811_2,Sam knows what he is talking about.,I get his wise perspective.,and
23890_1,"As I thought more and more about it, my perspective changed on how I thought about the war.",I though about the civilians affected by it.,and
37861_3,Situations would arise that would require she take it off.,She would find alternatives to taking it off.,and
38260_1,This makes me think how I would respond to that same thing happening to me., I find it hard to believe.,and
22727_1,We should put more effort into discovering the whole truth.,We should discover more than just the snippets that we hear on the news.,and
39052_3,In his forgiveness he was able to learn to transform hatred into forgiveness.,other constructive actions feelings in our lives.,and
29396_1,who generally do not think about the civilians,who do not want anything to do with the war but every day.,Nan
13988_1,They haven't made amends with marginalized people.,This is unlike Germany where they eradicated Nazi culture. ,and
29281_1,A question I didnt think of at the time ., there are fair skinned people in south Africa with straight hair.,Nan
20621_1,"The radicalization of the Bible by people like BLANK, will never happen in places such as America and other first world countries.",The views and people of a modern society would never allow it to control them.,because
19594_1,He had an assault rifle.,I was immediately mortified.,and
35346_1,I never really thought how I did judge other religions.,I never consider that I should see the world through someone else's eyes.,Nan
14755_3,New England and Canada have colder climates.,", where the sport is quite popular.",and
29420_3, it makes me question why we have to blow things out of proportion that, make one group of humans look worse than others by brainwashing people into believing negative lies.,and
37656_1,We have tools to learn about different cultures.,We have tools to speak without sharing a common language.,and
27537_3,the statement that society is build with white american staying on top benefiting from society,I do believe many view society are built to suit white american,and
36004_1,I think that Bassim is incredibly inspirational.,He has ability to not harbor any hard feelings or hatred towards the people.,because
28029_2,Live our life.,Upon moral ground.,and
36429_4,Hearing him say that made me realize.,I sometimes I do blame others for one's decision.,Nan
28777_2,Not that they live a happy life.,I would say mainly because of fear.,because
21086_2,"You wont go to hell for being gay, you repent or not.",Gay is who you are. ,because
23931_1,I think easily the most powerful thing this amazing man said was that he had no hate for the US.,He was able to forgive them for the accident.,and
34299_1, the future., hope we learn,Nan
20568_2, I should treat it as a resource to understand the basis of certain issues.,I can further my knowledge about them.,so
22159_1,The worst part was that this guy was recruiting for one of the extremist groups.,You hear about one of the extremist groups in the news today.,and
34388_4,Very little Americans travel to places like Afghanistan.,We rely on the media to tell us what's going on there.,so
27118_1,The German people let Jewish stereotypes skew their vision of society.,The German people let homosexual stereotypes skew their vision of society.,and
9117_1,Focusing on our improvement and talking to one another like were all the same.,Is completely ignoring those who are still suffering from stereotypes and violence from white supremacists.,Nan
27064_2,it is wrong,it needs to be changed,and
30227_1,religion can be very touchy topic for many,people tend to feel strongly about their believes,because
34580_1,Stacys question was one that I wanted to ask.,I figured that a lot of people did as well,and
11190_4,They are more susceptible., to adopting racist beliefs from their parents and peers.,so
26797_5,We regularly invade their country.,We don't care that many of their loved ones have died.,so
28794_1,I thought only of US soldiers.,I thought about the difficulty of leaving loved ones to fight overseas.,and
31326_1,"I think more people should hear what we heard from Rafi ,LTC Garey.", a difference hearing their perspectives on these issues.,because
42601_2,We can make strides to better the future.,We can take away this fear.,and
36206_5, how he started out angry he felt that it would simply eat him alive, I realized that I am the same way.,and
25767_2,Millions of civilians are affected by the war.,We may not even know about them.,and
23898_1,I think this was a great class., I appreciate all that Rafi shared with us.,and
37803_3,They are worried about their country.,"Which, doesn't bring the attention to the countries that need it.",and
25523_1,Sharia is completely misunderstood in the west. ,It is villainized as this oppressive way of living. ,and
39047_5,We really take it for granted.,I do not think we appreciate how lucky we are to live here.,because
42589_3,Most of the news we ever see about the Middle East is about war.,That doesn't mean that thats the only thing going on there.,and
34929_3,I agree with the fact that Basim's forgiveness comes Customs.,we lack that culture here in America.,and
38153_1,We treated him horribly.,I see why people dislike America.,so
27465_1,It is my believe that interpretation of old teachings is a large part of religion.,"Thus, being the reason there are many different religions.",so
33569_1,The current problem is that there are policies in the government.,are solely based on religious ideals.,Nan
26218_1,I like how Sam brings humor and his own personal experience into the equation.,He tries to relate and get a few laughs.,Nan
39995_2,One benefit from this class.,Being able to understand other cultures.,so
39691_4,We need to worry about eliminating poverty.,We should fix our infrastructure.,and
15776_1,People get dumb tattoos that don't mean anything.,They aren't alienated for centuries. ,and
14429_1,I had trouble identifying others from different cultural backgrounds.,I would have felt uncomfortable.,and
16423_5,Rafi's family are the same way. ,They've all been through the same things.,and
9616_1,I feel like I dont know anything about most countries besides what I hear about in the media.,This is such a massive issue today!,and
39047_1,"We are so privledged in America, no matter what circumstance.",We really take it for granted.,and
31851_2,Everyone will think the same way based on a piece of literature.,Everyone will act the same way based on a piece of literature. ,and
40104_4,the fact that Sam brought up empathy and the importance of it I think was extremely relevant to the course.,I think it was extremely relevant to our lives in general.,so
36279_7,I can see myself becoming humble to every kind of culture.,I can see myself becoming humble to every kind of idea.,and
32555_1,The way Basim forgave is truly inspiring.,The way Basim was able to move on with his life is truly inspiring.,and
16066_1,That would've been cooler.,I understand the time we have in class.,because
8228_2, defeats the whole race, purpose of the class is to learn culture,Nan
19663_2,They fear for their life.,Movies display the country as a desert.,and
32591_5, have much confidence  wearing their Hijabs., have much confidence  wearing their Hijabs,and
36122_1,It was really cool to be in touch.,I learned more about someone's life in a different country.,and
40938_1,Christians claim KKK members labeling themselves 'Christians' who commit violent acts are not actual Christians.,People fail to realize the hypocrisy.,and
22484_1,Sam did a great job bringing in Rafi.,A lot of people won't believe whats actually going on until they actually hear it from someone who lives it everyday.,because

30957_2,They both believe in the message of God.,They both believe in praying with faith.,and
32641_3,It's because a lot of people have never met someone of the Muslim faith.,They have not had a conversation with them.,and
33483_2,"The now destroyed Great mosque of al nuri, which is one of the main reasons why America see Iraq as an enemy. ",American does not see Iraq as an ally. ,and
40102_6," People please stop to think about the actions of others, maybe some of those things, words said would never be said.","Stopping to think about different perspectives, take a walk in someones shoes you learn a lot.",because
34508_2, The media wants to portray our country as the best.,We do no wrong. ,and
38698_3,it was very obvious to see that through the photos.,the words Sam had said about Bassim.,and
36578_2,He starts complementing us.,He even saying he loves America.,and
29886_1,I do not know much about Afghanistan at all.,I quickly assumed that women barely had any rights in their country.,so
31571_2,Bosim hopes that in four months he will be able to move back home.,Bosim hopes he will begin a life in Mosul again.,and
38273_3,It may be easier to see someone elses point of view when it comes to religion up to a certain point.,That is a choice.,because
34481_2,He had a meal with Americans who were very respectful.,this made him realize that Americans are not bad people.,and
24644_1,It puts you in the shoes of the people who are actually there.,They actually have to experience these things on a daily basis.,and
42729_2,"the scale of 9 11 and Basims bombing is very different, we  hold the grudge of 9 11",after that tragedy we always had a certain idea of what Muslim people are like.,and
29645_4, it helps us to become more culturally aware.,it can diminish some of the stereotypes.,and
27136_2,More extreme believers in the religion only hear what they want.,The activity in class and video proves it.,Nan

36447_2,They do not see it.,They are so focused on the things that they differ in.,because
22294_4,We feel connected to people.,remain caught in the midst of violence.,and

35063_2,His religion tells him to forgive. ,He uses his religion to guide him through his life.,and
40401_1,Take the time to get to know a person.,What is on the inside matters.,because

28599_1,I forgot the basic concepts of differences in people's wiring,I did not apply it to this ongoing for centuries issues,and
34212_2,everyone should take more seriously.,the world would be a better place.,because
13545_1,This is obvious,There is a racial divide in sports.,and
20955_3,I was highly curious.,and Rafis response did not disappoint.,and
20709_1,Not knowing if he would be killed or not.,It made it all too real for me.,and
34528_3,Taliban forced all women to cover their faces,It was completely forbidden.,and
26174_2,That is an oversimplified summary of Sams argument.,I think it is important to distinguish the important parts of the bible from the more obsolete ideas.,and
33348_5,It makes it so much easier to talk about these issues.,See the different points of views of people in a more open way.,because
16395_2,Sam displayed the picture of all the cars in a big road stuck in a traffic jam.,It's just like we may have all been in before.,Nan
29192_1,"However, it is impossible to fully understand it.",it is so tiny.,because
38124_2,That are affecting people everyday.,Religion should not have complete control over.,Nan
7654_1,These features are only in .01% of us. ,They affect us much more.,so
38264_2,many more people would be happy with the way they live.,If more people were not holding grudges that are already passed.,and
34399_3,Saddened to learn how many civilians.,Were killed.,and
40408_2,I can't help but think about something like that happening in the US.,President Trump would use it as an excuse to go into war.,and
9872_1,I completely agree with everything Sam pointed out in class.,I completely agree with everything you pointed out in this discussion.,and
39617_3,They would understand better.,They would have a different outlook on things.,and
38308_2,Attacked as a great driving force.,That gave  the American government even more reasoning to invade Iraq.,Nan

36226_2,They are focused on keeping strong control.,They are focused on keeping up with the war.,so
28899_3,You think what you think.,Doesn't make someone's opinion.,because
34968_1,a lot of it has to do with society.,it is setup to put women in a certain position less beneficial than men.,and

35058_1,He took a completely different path.,He forgave the government.,and

12180_1,What do I really know about people in other parts of the world?,I really don't know much at all from first-hand experience.,because
36589_1,"Today, I think younger populations are exposed to much more diversity earlier on in their lives due to the cross-cultural interactions.",Relationships are forged through our society's increasingly global perspective.,and
8623_1,"To say that black people, Muslims and Mexicans are less evolved than white people is just plain wrong.",I've seen that myself.,and

34000_2,Did Christianity fail me?,Is the Muslim faith better?,so
28971_3,To deal with Muslim extremists.,With the ongoing war.,and
8719_1,I think that in America we are taught to say African American.,It is the most correct.,because
21616_4,I think about my dad and my family.,This was happening to us in America right now.,Nan
12899_1,A class like Soc119 really does allow us to accept our differences,We can be understanding of everybody. ,and

36535_1,A Muslim man noticed this.,"He tried to help her, but she completely ignored him.",and
8482_1,"In addition, there so much more to every country and culture.", I end up thinking that if we were open to learning about other countries.,Nan
11461_2,They are more likely to sign you up for that sport.,You are too young.,and
31678_1,I struggle to find the ethos of the writers of each piece of literature as well.," because, as far as I know, God did not write the Bible.",Nan
40915_1,Many Muslims hate all Americans.,It's because many Americans hate all Muslims.,because
27672_3,My best friend is gay.,I believe the Bible is out of date.,so
25488_1,There are criminal actions that aren't found in the Quran.,People just interpret each infraction.,and
11190_1,Racism is a learned behavior.,Schools aren't providing kids with the historical framework necessary to understand racism.,so
26599_1,It's no surprise to anyone.,The current U.S. government is implementing policy.,Nan
26490_3,"Bringing up groups like the LRA, Christians just ignore it.",The LRA cannot possibly be Christians.,because
20487_1,He brings back many stories.,Often he talks about the children.,so
38239_5,He showed us the pictures.,He showed us the message he sent.,and
31203_1,the photo Sam showed in class of the shopping mall surprised me,everytime he said real people it felt really strange because I was opened to a world I was absolutely unaware of,and
37790_1,We took military action.,While doing so we attempted to better the lives of the innocent citizens involved.,and
41462_1,This applies to religion too.,The way people interpret the Bible.,and
31651_1,The discussion that was the most interesting to me in these past two weeks was Black Devils.,The discussion that was the most interesting to me in these past two weeks was Racial Supremacy. ,and

38254_2,"With my feelings towards this, I admire Bassim greatly",I am so thankful that he spoke to the class about his feelings towards what happened.,because
9216_1,We often don't even talk about racism against Native Americans.,It is an uncomfortable and embarrassing look into the racist past of America.,because
12966_1,"No matter what, race will always be talked about.",It is a big issue today.,Nan
33598_2,the views  most students have are covered up.,due to the idea of political correctness.,and

21573_1,We just have this broad view that everyone in Afghanistan is terrible.,We just have this broad view that everyone in Afghanistan is out to get us.,and
32057_1,"He lost his wife, daughter, brother, nephew, and dog.",He lost everything he owned.,and
41290_1,Basim had his whole life change due to an American mistake., we need to accept responsibility.,and
42503_2,I appreciate him pointing them out.,I feel that this Christian habit of radicalizing each and every detail of the Bible should not speak for the entire community.,and
39322_5,I felt sad for Bassims situation.,"At the same time, I felt interested in his story.",Nan
34207_3,normal everyday Muslims,simply follow their religion much like many Christians.,Nan

36193_1,Zero Dark Thirty is my favorite movie.,Based on real life events that happened during the Iraq war.,and
38261_2,I would be upset.,I would have to go into solitude.,so
35065_1,Watching this video made me fairly upset.,Bassim's immediate response to the question was no.,because
35406_4,I see someone that went through many difficulties.,They have strong faith.,so
38035_1,He was able to take such grief. ,He turned it into positivity. ,and
24311_2,Negativity is placed on people.,We would be much more of an understanding culture.,and
8951_1,I have noticed myself being less quick to guess or classify people into where I think their ancestors are from.,I learned I was actually really bad at it.,because
25285_1,I think the idea of Sharia can be applied to any religion or any belief set.,That was what Sam was trying to teach us.,and
9631_2,One of the students said that we should ignore race as we all equal and interact with each other.,Based on the conduct and manners we have.,Nan
9939_1,It is truly fascinating to think about the future.,The majority of people will be of all different kinds of backgrounds.,and
36572_1,I think everyone in class that day should take that quality.,Everyone should use it in their everyday lives.,and
33483_3,"The now destroyed Great mosque of al nuri, which is one of the main reasons why America see Iraq as an enemy. ",American does not see Iraq as an ally. ,and
37687_1,Basim is a strong person who is an excellent example of the goodness within certain people.,I believe we are all born with it.,and
32672_6, they just make much sense really just show how,messed up the world  people of different groups can be.,so
23822_3,Each side could understand the teachings of each of religion.,There could be more religious stability in the Middle Eastern region.,Nan
35684_1, Hate takes over your life.,You dont forgive.,and
12199_1,"To be completely honest, this class so far has furthered my thinking about other races.",I feel like I am more comfortable already talking about race. ,because
15565_1,I am not a natural citizen. ,I was laughing. ,Nan
36722_4,People make their own race culture seem superior.,People make their own race culture seem much more pure.,so
38876_3,I tried to imagine what life would be like.,A group of people randomly came in.,and
37729_2,We're good people.,The problem he has is with  the government.,Nan
27535_1,I agree with you,it is not easy approaching a person of different cultural background,Nan
29131_3,That way they can understand oversea events,they can make their own decision about the best course of action having all the facts,and
32654_1,"Engaging in dialogue about our differences is  important,", really the only way we can begin to understand people who aren't like us.,so
31451_1,People from these countries seem happy with the way things are run there., Id believe the media is amplifying the discrimination for views and to cause concern.,so
15451_3,Rafi has to live every day with a chip on his shoulders.,He isn't guaranteed anything.,and
7965_2,People use the word EVEN THOUGH.,It makes me very upset.,and
28754_2,I was taught to use the Bible as a sort of guide.,I was taught to use the Bible to help me with any challenges I may face in life.,and
40094_1,I can't hope to imagine what it's like to live there your whole life.,It helps to keep things in perspective.,and
36574_2,I have a close friend who just joined the Army a couple months ago.,"He will be active duty to go to the Middle East, most likely.",so
34686_4,I learn from him.,he experiences  many things.,so
34691_1,What struck me much.,this class was the fact that we actually had the chance to speak with Basim over skype.,so
40752_4,to have the desire.,To look at the world from other peoples perspective.,and
25329_1,The Bible and the holy Quran share many similar lessons.,They share historic events that shaped the history of humanity.,and
25721_2,How blacks reacted with how whites defended themselves.,Then they are continously making excuses for whatever happened years ago,Nan
42595_3,Sam asked the frat guy something.,What would it take for him to go out and protest?,Nan
29344_1,Who is a men,Which person have  much,so
26137_2,Many people are sharing their stories/views on racism.,Many people are spreading the word.,so
33074_2, The Prophet (peace be upon him) came to learn that there would be an assassination attempt on those who did not believe in Islam.,He and the fellow Muslims fled Makkah. ,so
42539_3,We live in a Christian society.,We dont experience their people or culture on a day to day basis.,and
40589_3,I also respect the intent of what Sam was trying to do.,This is a 100 level class.,because
27793_6, Asian facial features with the historical events that attempt to explain., they may share physical features.,and
34062_2,It hurts you more if you don't.,You'll keep dwelling on it.,because
15664_1,Talking about race a lot may help us break away from our barbaric ideas.,Talking about race a lot may help make us a more racially equal world.,and
7920_1,America has struggled with racial tensions throughout time.,I believe the topic of race has not been addressed properly.,because
40621_1,"People who use these books regularly, need not to focus on all the bad events.","I agree, they need only to take the good, the positive, the love from it.",and
14523_1,These might be organizations such as the KKK.,They might disagree with followers of the alt right movement.,and
22053_2,Why did this country adopt a motto that includes a specific religion?,Why didn't this country try to be more inclusive?,Nan
9121_2,I am definitely someone who has done that in the past.,This class has made me realize that.,and
33998_2,I know that I would never ever be that courteous  kind talking to people who live ,in the country that bombed my house  killed my family.Another thing I realized ,and
36228_1,Why is it that fighting is important.,Keeping other human beings is not?,so
36914_1,I was surprised that he was not angry at the Americans for the bombing.,If it was to happen to me I think I would be.,because
29474_6,my heart but  open my eyes that, they experience many of the same things  us but on a more extreme level.,because
15508_1,We have a government that can't acknowledge their mistakes.,We have a government that can't fix their mistakes.,and
19977_2,Are we really?,"We do not perceive Afghanistan to be a country full of real life people, traffic jams, shops, and families.",Nan
34354_1,Things happen in America all the time.,People wont speak out to it as being racist or terrorism as long as its a white person doing it.,and
10254_1,Talk about it.,Don't make it uncomfortable. ,and
23858_1,This begs the question.,Would there have been different outcomes of the war?,Nan
36967_2,I was never able to understand it. ,In this talk I fully understood the reason of the US government entering Iraq.,and
26961_2, it's lead entirely different lives,of what they think the words should mean.,because
15729_1,Lighter skinned individuals do have a privilege.,They need to be aware.,and
32391_3,They don't leave time to contemplate their effect on people.,This is why this class is important.,and
41306_1,"When Sam initially started talking about Basim as any other normal person, I kind of blanked out. ",I almost saw it as something unimportant.,because
40304_4,I care about those who aren't in my group of friends.,I care about the environment.,and
39364_2,No one knows what decision he would make. ,Breaks happen.,and
37881_2,They have to live in a war zone.,They must be living in fear on a daily basis.,and
38057_4,I have had many interactions with other students.,They make it quite obvious that there can sometimes be limited knowledge.,and
35852_1,I learned a few things that I didn't know before.,Women who want to be separated from their husbands have to have one of four reasons to explain their decision.,and
38349_1,His philosophy of forgiveness from his religion has helped him move past his family's deaths.,His philosophy of forgiveness from his religion has helped him rebuild his life.,and
36173_1,Basim said he was angry at the first.,He learnt that anger could eat him from the inside.,and
16475_1,It put faces to these people that we make out to be monsters.,I recognize that not every person that lives in that part of the world is automatically the bad guy or terrorist.,and
35796_2,He went to college here.,He made a lot of friends.,because
32490_1,All isnt God supposed, to be merciful loving?,and
41854_2,It is happing all over the country.,It is happening to various families as well.,and
40485_3,He confirmed there was a time. ,He was angry with the United States. ,and
30238_5,hey did work hard to be where they are today,"I have also worked hard to be where I am today, using my privilege as a boost.",and
39782_2,While the candidate pick each other apart.,To prove they are most qualified for the position.,and
39373_1,Everyone has pride in their own country.,Everyone doesn't want to think the worst of it .,and
38015_4,a small portion of the Muslim population has caused pain.,a result of historical events due to differences in religion.,and
16156_1,Many people just dont have enough time or energy to invest in getting to know another race or culture.,They just automatically place other people into categories.,so
16244_1,I cannot fathom what it is like to be living in the midst of a war zone.,I can't fathom having to be very cautious everywhere I go.,and
27177_1,"Sadly, I know our world is not perfect.","Controversy is almost inevitable,",and
15948_2,One has to expect some disrespect.,It will be brought along.,Nan
40764_1,Basim has come far in his journey.,Basim astounds me.,so
40442_5,The Americans he had met had been nice.,He thought anger does not do any good.,because
19550_1,"By being diverse and learning about other cultures, we better ourselves as people.",We can better those around us.,Nan
20952_3,they are much less likely to view them as wrong.,they do not want to view themselves as ungodly or bad.,Nan
10901_1,The NFL doesn't like that they have bad publicity.,"Honestly it is such an effective, peaceful way to get across a message that needs to be heard.",and
31785_1,"However, those stereotypes are no different from the ",Christians that we see preaching hate to everyone on the street.,Nan
24420_1,The thought is heart wrenching.,It led me to think about the war.,and
35987_3,Wearing a hijab actually empowers these woman. ,Wearing a hijab allows them to be much more comfortable.,and
40992_1,America is nothing but government.,Everything that is in America is ran by big brother.,Nan
37217_1,people take this faith to use it as dogma.,people use faith to advance their own desires.,and
24776_1,I have always thought I had an idea of what the country was like.,"In reality, it was skewed by the media.",Nan
26341_1,We shouldn't be killing innocent people around the globe.,We do it on behalf of men in suits to allow them to go cash checks at the bank. ,so
26216_1,I get the idea of this exercise.,I am somewhat confused by it.,so
34257_1,When a student claims that Christian members of the KKK.,Other hate groups.,and
10968_2,He talks about topics most people wouldn't feel comfortable talking about.,He says things that people wouldn't feel comfortable saying. ,so
8767_1,I am white.,I grew up in a rural area of Pennsylvania.,and

39875_1,Dr. Richards explained that he is not a Muslim.,he wouldnt be able to believe in evolutioN.,because
40421_1,Basim identified corruption in Iraq the main problem.,We are focused on weapons of all kinds. ,and
34852_2,What it is like for people who are not white to live in America?,We should just learn their perspectives.,and
29685_3,Moving back there to live produces a certain response.,People tend to look down on those who move back there to live.,and

11685_1,People of the United States have never come to terms with these disheartening events.,The reason this genocide took place has never been addressed.,because
38291_4,he did think about family  that have been influenced by his strength.,they have been influenced by his understanding.,and
29695_1,This is why this specific activity ,was interesting.,so
39148_6,We can get up and take what life throws at us and be resilient.,We can find a way overcome our problems.,and

19917_3,There are prejudices against other people who are different.,There are prejudices against other people who are foreign.,Nan
26549_3," the fish is in it, it lives it's who life in it that it doesn't really feel it.",this really opened my eyes.,so
19756_3,They can have completely different views.,They can interpret one book in many different ways.,so
21218_2,That it can end conflict in peace instead of lives lost.,That really stuck out to me.,Nan
37951_2,Showed me I know little of what our country does.,With it's large military and global power.,Nan
30265_1, living by the Bible can is hard that,should not be done at all,so
12908_1,"If I ever have a question about someone's culture, I ask.",I feel like that's more polite than remaining ignorant.,because
30913_2,an entire nation with many people., the complexities of life is not an effective way to run a nation.,and
10230_4,Isaiah Thomas is an all-star talent.,"Allen Iverson, who are all not that tall and not the best physically gifted.",Nan
42352_3, I asked myself why that is., people in our country participate in acts of violence.,because
11670_1,I have talked about race my whole life.,I never thought I talked about it excessively.,and
35631_1,They say that he just has to say he wants a divorce.,It can happen.,and
29797_1,I love how people who have visited Afghanistan say that, they are the most welcoming genuine people,and
27157_4,He said I love my family.,We have to study more about foreign countries before we start judging.,and
41190_5,he knew he had to put his anger to the side,realize he could not personally point the finger at all American citizens.,and
36235_2,All we see is a lot of Islamophobia in our country today.,I absolutely agree with it.,because
7857_5,They have the same feelings like myself.,They have the same feelings like Sam.,because
41422_4,It was not them who destroyed his home.,It was the American government.,and
26647_1,Which ethics morality are morphing changing to today's,that societal expectations constantly,and
35802_1,Its easy to judge people.,"people that are from another country ,city , religion",and
20980_1,This definitely was an eye-opening lecture.,I'm glad that this discussion was brought up.,and
30269_3,which islams use the Quran that answers to various difficult questions,who don not exist within these texts,and
21862_3,I can realize for myself that the world is filled with people who are trying to make it by with their family.,They are trying to make it by with their pride.,so
20273_1,Sam's lecture demonstrated that reverse racism is a myth.,It doesn't really exist. ,and
21095_1,Both the brave men and women who protect us.,The civilians are negatively affected by war.,and
33148_1,There are many extremists who have carried out attacks in the name of their respective Gods.,Muslims get scrutinized the most.,because
27667_1,I viewed it many different ways,I have difference experience than my cousin reading it,and
30929_1,I am curious to know if court is involved at all with divorce in Afghanistan.,"In America, courts are used in nearly every divorce.",because
21631_1,You cannot blame those who are ignorant for acting the way they do.,The know no better.,and

24666_1,I really agree with you,"what you are saying here, I agree with.",Nan
30946_1,I personally believe that people do have the right to an opinion.,I believe they can use the Bible to influence their beliefs.,and
40123_2,"if we did interpret it literally, which you would think would be the best way, we would be stoning people to death.",We would be completely unprogressive.,and
12938_1,That s something I catch myself doing on a daily basis.,It's not because I am a racist or anything.,Nan
23288_1,Most people who think about the military would describe them as fighting for our country.,I find it enlightening to know that they are affecting others lives in a good way as well.,and
33748_2, why would the U.S. presidents.,be any different to an Iraqi like Basim.,Nan
27601_2,we have different controversial topics,we need the realization of our differences,and
34429_2, It is worth it.,That was the old lady's advice.,so
37472_2,We need more of an emphasis on this.,All the stereotypes our media has given to the Afghan people.,and
32158_1,i think that he is wise to be able differentiate,between the American Government Americans.,and
22436_1,"Then, they remember the negative aspecs of what we said.",It keeps going in these vicious Whisper Down the Lane scenarios.,and
32732_2,"Its basic to treat people with respect we let other people,","like the media, make preconceived notions us  really",so
26142_1,We need to keep talking about it until every single person here recognizes its negative impact on society.,We need to keep talking about it until we completely fix the issue.,and
10707_1,My mom was born in Norway. ,It always blows my mind that two people on the absolute opposite sides of one land mass eventually married.,and
36401_2,there is hope that this feeling of empathy for others will become instilled in younger generations,It will make this dream possible,Nan
21439_1,Most of my teachers have probably engaged in all those acts.,They were disciplining us so harshly for not saying god bless you.,and
24086_1,There are many people who recognize the Bible being their guidebook to life.,It is a perfectly rational decision.,so
39629_1,It is a hard decision to make.,American soldiers are constantly dying in battle over there in an area that often times seems to be running low on hope.,because
41098_1,This outlook is based on opinions.,It is extremely controversial.,because
21209_1,"But I truly hope in the future, we focus less on the things like war.",I hope we focus more on the different aspects of their culture.,and
26819_1,This class discussion helped to really humanize the Afghan people.,"It showed everyone, in many ways, they are just like us.",and
37983_4,I tried to put myself in Sam's shoes. ,I tried to imagine how I would feel after a tragedy like Sam's. ,and
28143_1,The story that Rafi told the class about the little boy who was shot by the US military.,They thought the incense he was using was a chemical weapon.,because
23549_1,This often leads to large misconceptions from people.,It creates incorrect assumptions.,and
8270_2,I hope that any close-minded individuals in our class will see through these examples. ,"The sooner society accepts the idea of complete and utter equality, we will no longer be stuck in the horrible spot that we are now.",because
41057_1,I am upset about what happened with the terrorist. ,It does not make me angry will all Muslims I encounter.,Nan
41740_2,I too was curious about this question.,I was intrigued by the response.,and
27118_4,The German people let handicapped stereotypes skew their vision of society.,The German people passively allowed Hitler to rise to power.,and
24067_1,It's crazy that those people gain a following.,It proves to me how irrational some idiots can be. ,and
20705_1,Rafi said that Afghanistan citizens are peaceful people.,His job as a lawyer involves spreading peace.,and
33241_6,that we need to be thankful  the life we have  try to overcome this attacks ,"Bassim said, living my life in anger was only hurting himself   hindering any progress.",and
26852_1,Laws of abortion are being threatened by this administration.,"They view themselves as Christians first, Americans second.",and
34901_3,all our government does is attempt to give him a measly sum,that will never compensate the lives lost.,and
23265_1,I think it is important to find something that makes you believe in what you are doing.,It is important to find something that gives you purpose.,and
33730_1,"Hearing about Bassam's story, seeing pictures of his family,  finding out", our country is the reason he lost many things he loved.,so
28228_1,although I disagree with things U.S does living in America,comparing it to something portrayed as worst thing ever is not something I am inclined to do,because
36258_2,I tried for a minute to put myself in his shoes.,I tried to imagine this happening to my family.,and
33501_7,to do through sometimes uncomfortable conversations  forcing the students to ,forget about what they have always known  looking at the world through the lens of another person.,and

30836_1,It was very surreal for me to have someone who had experienced the war. ,It was surreal to have someone who went through so much in our class to tell their story.,and
8787_1,It opened discussion.,It gave us a means to have meaningful conversations.,and
26265_1,"I have known spiteful, racist Christians.",I have known loving Christians.,and
14838_1,White person will  associates with another white person.,The white person maybe from opposite countries.,Nan
35286_2,I have come to the conclusion.,Forgiveness can be learned through many mediums.,Nan
28473_2,They should read the according holy book for that religion,They interpret the religion for themselves.,and
11989_3,I was thinking to myself I could definitely do this.,Sam had them all reveal where they were from.,Nan
38400_2," I come from a middle-class, white family",I had a fairly easy upbringing.,and
27101_1,I think there would be a problem.,"As the government, people implement Christianity.",and

41103_1,Putting yourself in someone else's shoes is key to understanding complex issues.,Putting yourself in someone else's shoes is key to understanding complex arguments.,and
35184_3,It isnt a two sided argument about one race vs another.,There are so many groups that were targeted and hurt.,Nan
34562_2,Everything we hear about Afghanistan is always something negative.,We were talking about women are not treated equally.,and
34126_1,It was devastating to see how all of that was destroyed in seconds,there's nothing we can do about it.,and
30825_3,It's something that a lot of Americans need to understand.,Come to terms with.,and
22459_2,It was still the same man I knew before the military.,He wasn't just a robot.,because
22885_1,They probably live in a world much different from our own.,They do deal with bombings and other effects of war more so than we do here.,because
38158_2,I had to hear from tough guys in my life.,He is the guy who truly meets up with the definition of being forgiving.,and
36631_2,There is not reason to hate.,We had no idea of the horrible tragedy.,and
19715_3,They need to be informed of the reality of the world.,The world is the one many different race groups live in today.,Nan
30482_1,He is driven by his country.,He is driven by his peoples.,and
8332_1,I know that personally I would have been very bad at this activity.,I am not educated in anything talked about in this video.,because

32021_2,Most of the information we get from the news are statistics.,Most of the information we get from the news are line graphs.,and
29412_2,many modern problems are not addressed.,it is up to peoples' interpretations of those books to create laws for a large group of people.,and
9946_1,It makes me wonder.,What the human race will look like in the future?,Nan
33027_1,"I agree with you that church state must be separate, ",that I wish to see this happen in my home country of Pakistan.,and
31585_1,I can definitely agree with you on the point.,People in this world would lose their rights if individuals lived by the Bible word for word.,and
38923_2,Even more amazing is he uses his religion of Islam to allow him to forgive.,Even more amazing is he uses his religion of Islam to guide him.,and
31347_2,It gives us the freedom to agree with our own faith.,it gives us the freedom to disagree with our own faith.,and
8904_1,I really liked this post.,You said what we are all thinking.,because
23828_1,People need to be more understanding and intrigued to learn about other countries.,People need to learn how other cultures differ from ours.,and
29082_4,obviously interpret religious scriptures in ways that suit ,their personal beliefs  intentions.,and
14704_1,I immediately realized I had been spending a lot of time around my friends from Arkansas.,I picked up on the expression.,and
31611_1,This has been a philosophy America from day one., I think that far it has been effective in promoting religious freedom.,and
19404_1,"When the little kids were blessing the soldiers, as a practice of their religion, the soldiers shot and killed them. ",They were unaware of what the boys were doing.,because

39701_1,It's crazy.,The media depicts people from the Middle East as savages who live in a war crazed culture.,Nan
8731_1,It made me want to look at myself in a mirror.,I wanted to see what distinguishes me as an African American.,and
35916_8,why do people go killing others using what they interpreted from the Bible?, get confused due to the fact that I highly doubt any God would want people to kill.,because

40076_1,I talked with Basim.,I understand his point of view. ,Nan

41208_1,Let's touch on that a bit more.,Basim is also Muslim.,and

40308_3,I don’t know as much about the Middle East in general as much as I should. ,The United States are so involved there. ,and
38210_4,I think Basim in telling us this was attempting to raise awareness.,We work to prevent our government from letting these events continue to happen.,so

33325_3,It could change the way that future presidential candidates think and their platforms.,Change the United States citizens think about international issues.,because
27643_2,sometimes they try to incorporate their beliefs into ,policy  knowingly unknowingly.,and

9419_1,I come from a traditional indian family.  ,All of them had parents that are from there. ,and
39233_3,The people who claim to be Muslim yet attack our country are not ACTUALLY practicing that religion.,"If they were, they would not commit these crimes.",because

30157_1,Which individuals believe that islam is about violence destruction,who in reality the quran preaches peace,and
31428_2,They were in religious books.,That was a part of their lives.,because

42069_4,I personally would like to thank Basim  sharing his lessons with the class., it is really important to us to see other perspectives in the world.,because
32809_1,Having conversations with others that do know what is going on is , confusing  frustrating  me.,so
38212_1,What we have covered in this class has been some of the most knowledgeable information ,valuable information Ill keep with me  the rest of my life.,so

9342_1,He went off to Ohio State.,He has now had a black girlfriend for six months. ,and
21211_1,"Things like that, should be a focus.",A nation is not characterized just by its political conflicts.,because

10883_3,Terrorists are enforcing unjust laws.,US drones are striking civilian-occupied areas.,Nan
19154_3,This person used to live in that country., for more than twenty years.,because

22441_1,She told me that I shouldn't tell people that I'm Arabic or Muslim.,She was so afraid of the Islamophobia going on.,because
41279_2, we practice different religions and come from different backgrounds.,that's true.,and
27048_2,Who have heard people talk  negatively about servicemen.,That the armed forces how what they do is wrong.,so

12465_1,"I think it is the same to hear people call hispanics no from Mexico, Mexican.",Perhaps the other way around even.,and
35644_1,"Bassim proved to me that there is much to be gained from accepting the past, ",I think that this is one of the most important lessons we have learned from this class.,so
36506_1,I know that he campaigned on getting soldiers out of Iraq and Afghanistan.,I see that ordinary people like Basim still feel that nothing has changes.,Nan
33496_7,Radical Christians are extreme. ,All we hear about in the media are radical Muslims.,and
12430_3,This seems to be a useful message.,It can be turned around and used to as an excuse.,because

40633_1,We don't always get to see the other view point.,It is so hard to relate.,because

29053_1,People really have misconceptions about how Afghanistan looks.,Nobody has really been there during these times.,because
27059_2,They feed the needy.,They do other similar things.,so
12474_4,A black person was unable to thrive without labor.,and that we gave them purpose.,because
14677_1,It's easy to mistake different races.,Education can tell what each different feature means for ancestry.,so

41070_2,We  were talking about how President Trump.,Put the ban on Muslim people.,and

24517_1,I think there are many ways to interpret the Bible.,People do interpret it in many ways.,and
10679_1,You actually talk to your neighbors.,You will find that you probably have a lot in common.,and
34480_1,One of the most important things that Bassim discussed is that he loves the people of America.,The government is the real problem.,Nan
31391_1,I think a huge factor of this is that people don't want to see the negative things that are associated with their religion. ,They want to put their own religion on top with positive outlooks. ,because
34617_1,We find ourselves caught up in these grudges.,That can have a huge impact on our lives.,Nan
35593_1,Basim's strengththe traumatic event was  inspiring.,the  ability to look at the silver lining was  inspiring.,so

36058_2,We are deeply upset by what happened to Basim.,Basim went through a lot.,because
33047_2,While religion may not be the only positive crutch that people can resort to in hard times.,It is important for people to find healthy outlets.,and
29018_2,When people think of war zones they think of deserts and third world countries.,The photo was shown of Rafi and his family on their birthdays and the pictured mall.,because
34505_3," I believe that all people of the United States, myself included.","make more of an effort to make the world a better place, any way that we can.",and
16169_1,What we can do is use the internet to learn about their culture.,"We should learn about causes of the war, along with the current climate.",and
14690_1,The human mind is linked everywhere.,The human spirit is linked everywhere.,and
40506_2,I find it interesting.,People prioritize certain sins as being not as bad as others.,so
30742_3,I found this interesting.,My best friend from homes parents had a very messy divorce.,because
30433_1,I can understand that real people are taking part in this war.,This war is not happening in my immediate life.,and
10157_1,It is a hot button issue.,America has a long history of mistreating different groups based on their race.,and
41637_4,We do not have a problem with oil.,We do have a problem with Russia.,and
11231_1,People come from all types of places.,They are going to have different opinions about things.,and
21355_1,I believe that God is very loving.,The Bible was written long ago.,and
38480_3,meanwhile religion should be something based upon peace and unity.,Religions should not be based on hate.,and
36916_1,He also said that his religion teaches him to live like this.,It teaches forgiveness.,and
40664_2,We occasionally need arguements.,We also need to be tested so we can learn.,because
23306_1,This is another factor.,Many people are not educated on other races.,Nan
31041_1,We should not look at it as negative.,It is how Christians would view the Old Testament.,because
10096_1,I am from Panama.,There is a big difference between social classes in Panama.,and
12256_1,I grew up surrounded by racist people who loved rap music.,I grew up with founding fathers who loved slaves.,and
9165_1,"However, we fail to realize something.",Most of the nations that we defame are much more wealthy than we are.,Nan
42324_1,It is true.,It is not often that we take a step back to understand why others do what they do.,so
29714_2, football are more popular ethnicity.,they probably have more resources.,and
22431_1,People are unwilling to explore other religions.,People become educated.,and
9109_2,"But, the times are different now.",Talking about race can be counterproductive.,Nan
25206_3,It affects every feeling they have.,It affects every decision they make on a day to day basis.,Nan
33241_5,that we need to be thankful  the life we have  try to overcome this attacks ,"Bassim said, living my life in anger was only hurting himself   hindering any progress.",and
38515_2,it is really heartbreaking hearing someone.,He lived through Isiss takeover of Iraq.,and
30330_3,I'm not saying it's a cult. ,"However, it's close to one. ",and
38886_1,seeing families torn apart by one bomb dropped.,Hearing suspected terrorist activities is  sadden.,so
38432_1,He learned to forgive America.,"It is what his religion (Islam) teaches, 'Forgiveness'.",because
38289_1,I feel like too many people hold grudges.,It only detracts from their social life.,and
42445_7,You explore.,see differently.,and
27494_2,It reminded me of the time I rushed to New Orleans  Hurricane Katrina hit., I was in the front lines helping rebuild homes.,and
37172_3,Who gets to decide what will be carried over into todays world ? ,Who gets to decide what is considered outdated? ,because
16350_1,I think people are dating outside of their race more now.,Love wins.,because
41696_6,He wants some kind of outcome to make up for the losses he has suffered., from which I dont blame him.,and
35615_2,He has a lot of American friends that he met when he lived here.,They have all been kind to him over the years.,and
41959_1,He said what he thinks.,It will be better in by then.,and
39278_1,There were many things I learned.,Everything they talked about was real facts.,because
11801_1,People ask me what I am.,They can't figure out where my ancestors are from by looking at me.,because
10929_2,I was raised here.,I think this is why race is a big issue in our country.,and
36970_2,His city was destroyed too.,He is still not angry. ,and
31595_1,Why didn't I know about Christians that are terrorizing villages?,Why didn't I know about Christians that are oppressing people?,and
30729_2, to one another really makes you question the point of having conflict that, different religions in the first place.,so
27507_3,Sam actually cares.,He puts in so much attention to easily tell the difference between traits.,because
27055_4,We only have information to go off of that we have been told by other people.,That is why I believe that both of these speakers experiences really opened the eyes of a lot of people in our lecture including myself.,and
30369_1,I hope that more people can get educated on Sharia Law and the Establishment Clause.,One day we won't have to worry about stuff like this.,so
38210_2,I think Basim in telling us this was attempting to raise awareness.,We work to prevent our government from letting these events continue to happen.,and
37684_3,We have micro aggressions towards Muslims.,Having a real person tell a story about the religion fueling forgiveness is important.,and
21230_1,"When you're in court, you have to state the oath of the sworn testimony.",There is still that aspect of religion.,and
36436_1,"I felt this was one of the most intereting, insightful lectures of the year. ",I got a chance to hear directly from a person who has experienced everything that Basim Razzo has had to endure. ,so
39043_1,He seemed to have had been affected.,He was affected by the United States government.,and
22902_3,They have hopes and dreams.,They are just like you or me.,because
41366_2,They wear long sleeves.,The sleeves cover their whole body.,and
37157_2,They tried sweeping the problem under the carpet by not making a huge deal out of it. ,They gave the survivors an embarrassingly low amount of money. ,and
27880_1,Religion should be something that motivates people.,It motivates people to be good people.,Nan
31275_4,He left to serve six months in Afghanistan.,My local congressman called him.,and
36805_5,It makes us look at our behavior. ,It makes us see if there is any hypocrisy there.,because
38069_2,This brought everything to life.,Truly grasped my emotions.,and
22264_1,I thought why should we help people that didn't seem to care if we were trying to help them.,"I was reassured to hear Rafi say that he, his friends, and family are grateful for the help.",Nan
30422_1,I think line graphs and numbers within statistics are hard to truly understand.,They distance the view of the graph from the actual violence.,because
42236_1,G-d gave him another chance at life.,Why would should he live life being sad everyday?,Nan
33647_2,Being accepting to someone who wants to learn about your culture is something extremely priceless.,Being accepting to someone who wants to learn about your culture will be a gift in life.,and
10607_2,It can create many dating opportunities with someone.,I think everyone should consider it.,so
41145_2,Books are a good way to make yourself cultured.,I still believe.,so
41504_1,It is always eye opening when Sam brings up a new topic with a twist.,It is always refreshing when Sam brings up a new topic with a twist.,and
30451_2,Beliefs are too different now.,For rules in the Bible and Quran to try and interpret the sacred books.,because
39339_1,What  if some foreign military came into the United States.,Infiltrated our cities and streets.,Nan
36055_1,Sam wants us to understand.,The world from other perspectives.,Nan
39160_6,His unimaginable pain.,What my country had done to his family.,and
41536_2,efforts of sheer force in their domestic lands.,"we were to portay our selves than a military power,  diplomats, I think we'd be better received.",and
35653_3,You question what you are taught.,You question what in life you believe.,and
19121_2,I slowly realized how did racial problems impact on the modern society.,I went to high school which is diverse.,because
30284_1,The topic of divorce in Islam is very controversial.,This is due to the fact that a man can basically instantly divorce his wife by repeating the word talaq three times.,Nan
36425_1,Generalization allows the message to be easily distributed.,Generalization allows the message to reach the most amount of people.,and
38652_1,I could not imagine having someone come to my house.,I could not imagine having someone set all of these rules which are unconstitutional.,and
41249_2, There are many judgement calls to be made.," When something is not mentioned explicitly, it may be interpreted in many many ways.",and
38116_2,The world has advanced so much where Mosul will end up as another city that is left behind.,The world moves on without it.,and
22185_1,I have a significant interest in how this war affects civilians.,I feel young people can contribute towards putting it to an end.,and
26473_1,These actions are often overlooked in mainstream media.,Many are willing to remain complacent instead of taking action for change.,and
29902_7," that get a divorce,  it all makes sense, that  there is ", many reason people may not want to be  anymore.,so
20288_1,Paul later realized what he was doing was wrong.,Paul ended up becoming a Christian himself.,and
36258_3,I tried to imagine this happening to my family.,I just couldn't even fathom the idea.,and
22019_1,Not only did it cause me to appreciate the fact that this war isn't happening on our own land.,It made me empathize with the innocent people who are dying from this stupid war.,Nan
27401_1,It is extremely unfair.,A man could be refused divorce.,Nan
40144_1,"To truly expand my perspective, I would need to travel the world.",I would live with people in different countries.,and
8498_1,Learning is far more important than education.,I think we need to fix the system.,and
27730_4,The divide is shocking to me.,The divide between church and state.,because
21524_1,This lecture has made me appreciate.,I do not live in a place.,Nan
31905_1,people in our country were a little more forgiving more knowledgable of,"people following different practicer simply different colors,",and
11975_2,My religious background excludes the evolution of apes to men.,Different races are simply the product of our ancestors' migrations. ,Nan
41965_4,I would be extremely upset.,I would be angry.,and
20704_1,"Like many people in the Unites States, Rafi has a family.",He has a career.,and
35479_1,There is immense agony that I have,Is there a real valid reason to hate America?,and
24308_3,"When it comes to acceptance of people from other countries, we immediately assume the worst.",We put them into the most negative stereotype possible.,and
32089_3,Reading up on more information it was such a tiny part of the hell ISIS created for Iraq.,Reading up on more information it was such a tiny part of the hell ISIS created for everyone around the world.,and
8295_1,The founding fathers built this country pertaining to upperclass white men,unfortunately the custom has stuck in today's world,and
30902_1,Religion was never meant to be a divisive tool.,Religion is something to bring structure.,and
38757_2,We discussed how its unfair for women to be completely clothed.,Men can wear whatever they want.,and
32634_5,At first I couldn't empathize with those who suffered through it.,I couldn't remember it at all.,so
28880_5,It strips away who you are.,Who you have the potential to be.,because
11322_1,Sam discussed that we shouldn't be afraid or embarrassed to talk about others features like noses., They are apart of who we are and our genetics.,because
28432_1,Afghan citizens are normal people.,They are just like us.,Nan
35777_1,That is why I think this class is so interesting.,That is why I think this class is so important.,and
22278_1,I learned that the times where soldiers feel like their lives are at risk are rare.,I learned that the times where soldiers are in contact with the enemy are very rare.,and
20217_1,Colonel Geary went to visit the command posts.,As part of his rounds for the Afghan security forces to talk to the suspected commander.,and
32336_1,It is something very interesting.,"every person who reads the book, can interpret the stories differently.",because
38513_2,This raises the question.,We're supposed to not like a group of people.,so
23614_1,They rule over villages.,They impose Sharia law on the Afghani people.,and
12091_1,It may have been beneficial thousands of years ago.,Society should have progressed to where that logic is unnecessary or detrimental.,and
26501_5,They adhere to American political traditions.,seems to be an unquestionably essential step in the campaign process.,and
35983_2,They need to be more skeptical of everything.,They need to search for the truth on their own.,and
38026_3,A person thinks the U.S. media doesn't give people enough information about the rest of the world.,A person thinks we need to be more aware about something.,and
40762_1,Sam asks a question. ,"""What if a foreign government came searching for your resources?""",Nan
42474_2,I thought this was interesting.,He was expressing how important forgiving other was to a religion.,so
29796_1, our country is  much larger than we have such a wide ,variety of people in our country people arent  trusting in one another.,so
24207_4,Muslims are innocently practicing extremely similar content., before we invade and declare war.,Nan
7568_2,It's subconsciously in everyone's mind,In the light it can be worked on.,so
33843_1,"More importantly, I think that people should really stop trying to interpret these books.",Unless they lived in that era.,because
32683_4, live their life somehow in a peaceful way ,all the conflict are around them.,and
35602_2,"The words of the Bible, which many people claim to live by.",The words of the Bible have been twisted to say what some want them to say.,and
40522_2,There are more people.,In a similar position and situation as Bassim.,Nan
31265_1,The books were written at least 2000 years ago.,Laws from the books are outdated now. ,so
42720_2,It is crazy to me.,There are so many people who generalize Muslims.,because
37304_1,Basim mentioned how ISIS entered Mosul.,ISIS started converting Mosul to something that it was not before.,and
39940_3,We all have different feelings.,We all have different beliefs.,and
12291_1,"It's not really talked about refferring to race, the amount of native Americans living in the country.","It ties into what Sam said, a lot of Americans don't think they exist anymore.",and
30946_4,"If you are debating on how a society should run, you should not use the Bible as a source.",It does not have the answers for the complexities and specifications of these arguments.,because
37356_1,You can do whatever you please. ,A hijab doesnt oppress anyone.,and
32059_2,"slaughtered their families, destroyed their home.",responded with a unconvincing reason of technical mistake.,and
36859_2,I have never had people challenge my viewpoints. ,I have never had people challenge my opinions. ,because
19431_1,I thought this video was really interesting as well.,"Being in America, we don't really learn about the people living in the war zones.",because
15373_1,I definitely started analyzing peoples faces a little more.,I have started noticing different traits on people.,and
24267_1,"When the troops leave after a few days, the Taliban takes back control of the villages.",The citizens are left in fear.,and
41323_1,The reason is to show us a different perspective.,It guides us toward a better life path.,and
14926_1,I think he was inferring that people who do this can be judged.,They don't match.,Nan
31829_2,the other will do nothing.,The other will have negative effects on you in the future.,and
19936_3,We think that everyone is against the United States.,We imagine that they're all our enemies. ,and
10835_1,"From a scientific perspective, people, having a dark skin tone, are able to counteract absorbing too much UV rays.",Avoid the risk of getting skin cancer.,and
32247_2, to say that all the morals., beliefs in the Bible Karan are outdated is completely misleading.,and
20659_1,I think this lecture opened up the minds of many students.,It enabled me to see different perspectives.,and
14510_3,I was really surprised.,Everyone was actually from A Latin American Heritage.,and
41966_3,How could Bassim not be angry with we Americans?,We essentially caused him to lose everything he had in his life.,Nan
22373_1,The live with enemies at every corner.,There has to be a strong reason.,and
23457_1,Everyone deserves the right to follow whichever belief system they chose.,They should  be completely safe in doing so.,and
15990_1,Penn State has a unique culture.,Penn State brings different backgrounds together.,because
38767_3,That would benefit the Iraqi people.,The revenue seems to go into the pockets of politicians.,Nan
10764_2,It was really interesting how impressionable the way people talk is.,I didn't even notice any change until someone pointed it out to me.,and
19648_1,We have a lot to learn about other countries.,This will help make the world a better place.,so
33961_3,Started  saying I was spiritual.,Rther than religious.,and
38357_4,I always use my religion to guide me through my life.,That's why I'm not angry at you.,and
39671_3,The wars help to foster anti-American attitudes across the globe.,There are direct victims of our warfare.,and
40863_6,He doesn't have hate in his heart.,He doesn't have anger in his heart.,and
42627_1,We cannot forget the people(citizens).,It's their country.,because
21637_1,You said that war is a business.,An image is portrayed of a certain group for business purposes.,so
22548_1,I really also appreciated how Sam put up real pictures of Afghanistan.,"They depicted the real, normal lives of the Afghani people.",Nan
37574_5,someone will always disturb the peace,it was decided long ago,because
34967_1,We have now touched on the topic of what privileges come along with being white.,we definitely do need to talk about the privileges that come along with being a man.,Nan
38557_1,I cant imagine going through something like what he went through,i am not able to talk about it to a large group of people.,Nan
27994_3,People can interpret how they choose.,People can interpret how they cherry pick.,and

34686_1,I go into Sams lecture every day.,I learn from him.,and

9607_1,I wish that one day there would be a time we could coexist.,I don't think that's going to be possible at this rate. ,and
29996_1,more christian in the U.S does not give us the right to tell people of their religion,what you are doing is wrong,because
20059_1,I agree.,It is very easy to forget what is happening half way across the world.,because
21788_3,Saying Americans believe soldiers are emotionless during service is untrue.,It is unfair.,Nan
20003_2,The families all go to work.,They have dreams and aspirations.,and
35816_2,I believe in my faith., I don't think I would be able to overcome that.,and
38336_3,I always pray when I am scared.,I always pray when angy. ,and
34386_4,it is hard to forget.,avoid the impacts of the ongoing war.,so
36505_4,He was affecting the normal people there.,I always assumed.,and
39651_4,In other war zones.,I was able to see a personal example from a real person.,because
30100_2,Religion can be  has been used  a tool excuse evil but ,"most religious people (Jews, Christians, Muslims) Ive come to know  serve",and
21759_1,It is always so upsetting to see.,One parent leaves the family.,Nan
35678_1,It is extremely important to throw away the labels.,We have on people.,and
25400_1,It's been in place for so long ago.,It's brought all back up again.,and
38158_1,I believe that Basim is one of the toughest guys.,I had to hear from tough guys in my life.,and
24821_1,Many practicing hold the Bibles scripture as law.,"They aim to live by it, word for word.",and
36252_2,I agree.,I gained respect for this man.,so
38303_1,I was raised a Catholic.,I went to Catholic school my whole life.,and
19027_1,Knowing this can help us be more conscious of the issues that are happening around that world.,Knowing this can make us less ignorant to things around us.,and
39150_1,I respect his decision in talking to our class.,He talked of what he went through.,and
32371_1,I really like something that you said.,I like how you said you ignorantly thought about/judged a lot of things.,and
38776_2,The society was ruined. ,The population displaced. ,and
31099_4,The Bible is filled with verses about rape.,The Bible is filled with verses about deceit.,and
24142_1,I've thought about how Christians are quick to say not all Christians are in the Klan.,But they believe all Muslims are terrorists.,so
9484_2,I was surprised to see that he picked my friend Melanie.,I had a few classes with Melanie last semester.,and
19133_3,It represented black Americans fighting against whites. ,"They had 25,000 members.",and
31913_2,Someone asked someone how he wasn't angry.,Someone asked why someone wasn't angry at Americans all the time.,Nan
19736_2,It was a more conservative time.,"Sam mentioned 1 Corinthians 'but now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler.'",and
30590_1,The man we skyped did not stay angry. ,He kept living his life. ,and
25996_1,They are what make different cultures unique.,They help create a sense of identity.,and
20764_1,They are very conservative.,They are traditional in their thoughts.,and
37736_2,We shouldn't use technology to simply keep our opinions. ,We shouldn't use technology to reinforce our beliefs.,and
27395_1,This made me think about the world.,I've been brought up in the world.,Nan
40562_3,It is a testament to his personal strength.,It is a testament to his perseverance.,and
30082_2,Having sex before marriage was uncommon.,Many other things were not allowed in the Bible.,and
27778_1,I got older,I question my religion more,and
32719_3,We are very similar.,The culture of the United States is blind.,so
28937_2,Conservatives being traditionally Christian Catholic.,They often push policies.,and
32574_1, the things that are stated can be interpreted., in many different ways.,so
35528_1,It is due to this.,We are able to disassociate Christianity with the violence of people and groups,because
27054_2,In the arguement that we don't see there is a middle ground.,Whether you support the military or side with those who oppose it.,and
20584_1,Thousands of innocent people are dying due to this war.,This war is being fought in the cities that those people have/had everything in.,because
38086_2,Dominate societies.,Is by controlling and limiting forms of communication.,and
28552_4,They need to understand what the social norms are.,They need to communicate with the people of the countries where they spend a lot of time..,so
12843_2,Many others have come to accept the white man with long brown hair.,The white man with long brown hair is the fixed image of the most evolved individual.,and
40873_6,The lecture helped me with my family., with Bassims ideas in mind.,and
33112_5,the dead will remain dead., the pain will only leave with time patience.,and
9686_2,They don't discriminate either,There obviously are certain oddballs out there that share different views.,Nan
40287_1,"As the world evolves, we will discuss different issues.","from there, we can see topics through different perspectives.",and
41558_2,Why would he suffer?,Be sad during his life.,and
40679_2,Those you would find in the US.,Who were just trying to get.,and
31049_5,A culture comes in.,points something out to us.,and
35983_4,They need to search for the truth on their own.,"It can be with their religion, or their views on other countries.",and
34499_1,This is the point I guess I am trying to make.,"Without connecting with different people, it is going to be impossible to change your mind about people.",and
40472_1,I appreciate that we were able to directly communicate with him.,It was an interesting learning experience.,because
24320_4,They have lives much like our own.,Portraying them similar to us would promote positive change.,so
37345_2," to gain his perspective, see the consequences of our countrys actions.", to learn from his actions- continuing his life of forgiveness.,Nan
27230_3,It is something people hold dearly.,It is something people talk about seriously.,because
21345_1,no matter what our race is we reject violence.,no matter what our race is we reject terrorism.,and
26322_2,There are no true specifics.,It leaves it up to interpretation.,because
9450_2,I doubt he can distinguish just based upon facial features.,"Honestly, he is often pretty accurate or close to the correct answer.",Nan
21569_1,Rafis talk made me upset.,The things that we focus on are very miniscule.,so
42718_2,He is Muslim.,He is told to forgive.,and
30799_1,Some Christians take the bible word for word.,They believe that anyone who is gay or gets divorced will not get into heaven.,and
38019_5,"Religion spreads peace, hope, love.",Religion provides a set of morals.,and
10542_3,Sam said she was perfectly balanced.,She was a perfect mix of the two backgrounds.,and
29277_2,The sun hurts people’a brains.,Hair offers protection from the UV rays.,so
41310_4,Tears were welling up in my eyes.,I could not believe something cruel could happen to him.,so
13276_1,They do not make others feel uncomfortable.,They learn that there is more than making a assumption on their race.,and
31378_4,They do not understand what Muslims are going through. ,They do not understand how Muslims feel.,so
15195_3,A black or brown skinned person comes from a different set of ancestors.,They come from a different region of the world.,and
21380_3,That's not necessarily a bad thing.,Recognize what they are.,and
41812_4,You sort of go through what your current perspective is about an issue.,You think about that agenda.,and
41688_1,"In life, you can force everyone to pay attention to what you think is the most important thing. ",They might not think it is as important. ,because
40880_1,The media should do their part to minimize hate in the world.,The media should release the facts.,and
27834_2,Racism is not a mainstream topic in the media in other countries.,Racism does happen.,and
15103_1,Asking questions about it can be sensitive.,I like the way that Sam says its just the way we are.,because
31929_1,I feel that forgiveness is a common theme among most not all religions., it must be important to learn how to forgive.,so
30556_1,I never really knew anything about divorce.,I never knew that these laws existed.,so
37836_1,"From what I remember; Basims wife, daughter, nephew, and brother were killed.","The US government offered him $2,000 for their deaths.",and
21837_1,I originally thought the war in Afghanistan was just people constantly shooting people.,I thought thought the war in Afghanistan was just people killing one another.,and
40477_1,He came to America before his life was ruined.,He saw how great the American people were.,and
12325_1,I think this was fascinating.,We learned that due to different shapes/ sizes of their physical features we can sometimes tell that they are from different places.,because
26682_1,People should have their own belief,to Enforce Christian on non believer,and
34955_1,I have no idea what is occurring overseas.,I have a few cousins and uncles.,Nan
9818_1,The whole lecture puts into perspective how similar everyone around you is.,I think that's why I enjoyed it a lot.,so
33550_1,We should reflect on Basims advice.,"Nowadays, we have resources we should take advantage of.",and
15589_5,I make progression through education.,I create a path to be followed.,Nan
38491_2,Basim is such a beautiful soul.,Basim truly was the light of the room during this class.,and
26912_1,His answer regards the hospitality that Afghan people showed towards him.,His answer regards the generosity that Afghan people showed towards him.,and
35863_2,We have to experience things we are uncomfortable with.,Race is one of the top values we are unfamiliar with.,and
31570_2,Bosim said that he lost many friends.,he was forced to leave Mosul.,so
34813_3,religious law is interpreted.,different ways for everyone.,because
41450_2,He hasn't done in since classes started.,It was bit concerning to me.,and
42080_1,my house was bombed.,my family was killed.,and
29581_8,it is a huge class,everyone may not get a chance to voice their opinion without using twitter as a platform,so
37208_1,My first impression was amazement. ,It was easy for the entire class to communicate. ,because
37939_1,I vividly remember this question during class.,it really made me think about a numerous of different things.,and
21193_1,They spend very much time pointing fingers at each other.,They never take the time to work out their own problems within their own groups.,so
19315_1,The problem with these outlets is they make things less personal.,They remove people from situations.,Nan
41443_1,I also really enjoyed hearing Basim speak in class.,It made me realize a whole other perspective.,because
41457_2,These people spread messages of hate.,These people spread messaged of harming others. ,and
42603_1,I was thinking about how I would feel.,I might be in their shoes.,and
30702_4,Even if your history was that gruesome?,relevant to your day to day life?,and
12474_2,Slave owners were helping their slaves.,A black person was unable to thrive without labor.,because
42520_3,Something will enable us to move past hate.,Something will enable us to move toward love.,and
8535_1,It can impact class in a positive way.,It can allow students to have open discussion during lectures.,and
33080_1,I thought it was interesting.,He mentions that he could only remain angry for so long.,because
39392_2,He has felt that pain.,He accepted it.,and
23268_1,I have a personal reason why I get out of bed every morning living my life in the best way that I can.,I want my baby sister to be proud of me by being a good example.,so
26948_2,The bible has a very similar stance on premarital sex.,The bible has a very similar stance on other issues.,and
21087_7,I could not imagine that he prefers men over women., that he would be punished for it by spending his afterlife in hell.,because
25818_1,No separation makes it difficult to agree on which religion to teach in schools. ,Everyone believes in something different. ,because
8039_2,Trips to parts of the world most similar to our own.,The trips  have affected my opinions and misconceptions,and
24091_1,Some individuals choose to see only the fact that there is mention of homosexuals.,Some individuals refuse to go on.,and
25845_3,It is important to know about the Establishment Clause as well.,We should be able to distinguish the difference.,because
40305_2,My first instinct should be to think.,I should analyze frustrating situations.,and
24527_4,We cannot rely just on these books to guide our lives.,we also should use our life experiences.,so
26782_4," I'm just not a brace person, I mean he yes daily death threats", his family are constantly in danger.,and
12484_2,It was a very eye opening point .,Many friends felt the same way.,and
31232_2,He should drive the back and forth discussion.,He should drive forth more.,and
27160_1,I like how they touched on the subject of divorce.,It is something they talked about before.,because
9564_1,There could be plenty of explanations for this topic.,This is what I believe.,Nan
21846_1,They are constantly arguing over how to interpret it.,This is prevalent in our society through the media.,and
39624_1,I have often thought.,Other countries do not care about who the American president is.,because
8692_1,This is a good exercise to witness.,It allows the people in the room to see that two people may look similar.,because
27751_1,Many people assume that a large amount of Muslim societies base their laws and norms around the teaching in the Quran.,That is not the case.,and
8107_1,America was built on diversity.,Humans have the ability to travel now.,Nan

39919_2,I think the lesson of learning to move on can be applied to many people. ,I think the lesson of improving our lives in better ways can be applied to many people.,and
32238_1,I chose this video.,I remember not knowing much about the lecture.,because
34823_4,"Christians should be discussed compared to other religions,like  Muslims.",one would see any religion bias.,and
30841_4,He had a great partner.,that was sadly murdered.,and
29410_3,the reality of it is that a majority of the people.,it follow these religions are doing to promote peace with love.,and
26587_6,We should focus on why we are giving more funding to schools who already perform well on standardized tests.,We should focus on why we are cutting funding to schools who do not as well.,and
36433_1,Living with hate won't get me anywhere in life.,It won't undo what's already done.,and
22966_3,It is hard to imagine their personal lives.,We are never exposed to that part.,because

12393_4,I was attempting to make my own guesses.,Te groups were finally made.,Nan
26656_1,It means more people are enthused about football.,"Therefore, more high schoolers go out for football.",and
32664_1,Human flaws  laziness will stop many,from ever taking the time to understanding the full scripture,so
30949_1,I use other sources of information to back up my opinions.,That is what I believe most Christians should do. ,and
39254_2,I cried tears of sadness.,Repent sadness because of his unimaginable pain.,and
20064_4,I never asked myself.,The history books go far enough to cover history in a correct fashion.,Nan
35224_4,They a dialogue.,That is how they became close.,and

29428_2,who says something i care deeply about,who something i am very weary of ,and
33927_5,People see the hijab associating it with negative propaganda.,Propaganda has been fed to them of the person wearing the hijab.,because
15484_1,"Overall, I think talking about race and continuing protests for equality is important.",It's a right that we should be thankful for here in the U.S.,so

26803_5,I associate war and the country together.,I don't have much knowledge on their culture.,because
21587_1,I am glad that Sam chose to talk about this.,I think it will push people to want to be more informed and create opinions for themselves rather than just watching the news and accepting what is told to them without having any actual education on the matter.,because
30317_2,the administration of this county need a serious reality check.,running a nation based on a religion has failed throughout history.,because
36345_1,We should be able to forgive even the worst possible situation.,It will negatively impact our lives living with the resentment.,because

32898_1,Having family in the military friends who were muslim made me, which grow up understanding that not all of them were evil.,and

42521_2,I believe forgiveness is one of the hardest things to do.,It is one of the most important things to do.,because

26275_1,I appreciated how he pointed out flaws in both the Quran and the Bible.,Members of each religious group don't feel particularly targeted.,so
32848_4,No one is wrong.,Nor is anyone right.,so
40318_3,We grow stronger in how we move on.,We grow stronger in how we tolerate the difficulties the world throws at us.,and
31538_1,Times opinions change throughout time it makes sense to me, that the Bible would only cover the very basis of what good human moral is.,so

26780_2,That you aren't sure what you would do,Which were in his shoes  this turmoil,and
28890_3,My aunt had a child out of wedlock.,My aunt considers herself a good Christian.,and
35842_1,I think people can take a lot away from this.,It shows that sometimes you need to keep going with life.,because
29430_2,we are seeing many more people joining our family.,We do not believe in christianity.,and

36997_1,I  know he wasnt looking for sympathy.,I couldnt help but feel for this man.,Nan

35896_3,They fail to see everything else around them.,They fail to see the rest of the world.,and

36282_1,He jokes with Sam.,Last time Basim spoke to a Soc 119 class someone asked the same exact question.,because
30558_1,I think it was imperative that Sam shed a light on the acts of violence committed on both sides.,Everyone knows about Muslim violence.,because
39828_2, it is unhuman to send bombs on innocent humans., they are human just like we are.,and

40700_1,Basim has more compassion and forgiveness in his heart.,Many people today who have not experienced half of what he has.,Nan
42590_7,We can be more well-rounded. ,We can be more aware. ,so

36239_1,Being affiliated with neither makes it easier for me to see this.,I can see the hate on both sides.,because
30631_3,Class discussion broaden our minds.,We really question those things we have grown wo live by.,and
30817_2,Both are explanations of why we are here.,Both are explanations of what our purpose as people is.,and

41746_1,The fact that Basim is able to forgive.,Due to his religion.,Nan
11254_1,"I don't see why those in the Alt Right, and the rest of the racists do not understand anthropology .",.1 percent is the only difference between each individual.,and

38956_3,my friends kept me updated on the culture that they witness there.,Opened my eyes to the impact that the United States has on Afghanistan.,and
7918_1,We can grow in mutual respect.,We can learn from one another.,and
30763_3,We all read everything we would know we weren't going to heaven.,Who honestly wants to be reminded of that?,and
38643_3,growing  emotionally is the part that is harder,growing intellectually is the part that is harder to people to grasp.,and

39981_1,I am not very religious.,"I struggle to understand how should my family be killed, how I could find strength to forgive.",because
26633_2,There are so many Christians out there with hate.,They have taken the Bible,because

19282_3,"Their children have parents, just like ours.","They work hard to support their families, just like us.",Nan
7621_1,It is played mostly by black people.,There are mostly black people living there.,because
8893_4,"For example, the iclicker helps.",since now students can affect the content of the lecture in real time.,Nan
23550_1,"Discussing religion, race, or homeland is important.",It shes light on truths about the rest of the world. ,so
9365_5,It does not matter what type they follow., some can be more religious than others.,Nan
32071_1,He is brave and strong.,He chose to live on with his life.,because
8301_1,I think there are too many cultures and opinions today for the government to accommodate everyone.,Until the moment the U.Sgovernment takes actionand reverts tradition.,Nan

39384_1,There is a type of fear.,There is a distorted view of Muslims.,and
10764_3,It was really interesting how impressionable the way people talk is.,I didn't even notice any change until someone pointed it out to me.,and
29853_3,I support the idea of having Sam do men vs. women in the same type of setup., a white women.,because
31966_3,Sam showed us pictures of the capital city.,Sam showed us pictures of the malls.,and
39679_2,The war on terror has created such a fear in everyone that lives on America.,They are unable to forgive.,so
26644_2,I never was really exposed to the Quran. ,The Quran is very similar to the Bible.,and
20814_1,I learned  it.,They weren't that different ultimately.,so
32959_3,I feel that most people dont understand that Americans tend to somewhat block out all the negatives that come from Christians.,the United States is heavily populated with Christians.,because

38787_2,The answer Basim gave.,Was extremely beautiful.,and
33315_1,We live in a representative democracy which, our government reflects on our people.,so

32228_3,Trying to attack anyone.,Trying to attack Christians.,Nan
33778_3,Mr. Bassim was angry.,Mr. Bassim realized how this behavior is not benefiting him at all. ,and
22638_1,I learned the phrase born-again thanks to an unlikely Christian such as George W. Bush.,Anti-Abortion bills from the Christian perspective are always part of the fare of the Presidential Candidates.,and
42711_1,Basim has been through so much.,The rest of the people that use to reside in Mosul have been through so much.,and

40104_2,if we could all see that and take a moment to try to figure out what those reasonings may be the world would be a more peaceful place.,the fact that Sam brought up empathy and the importance of it I think was extremely relevant to the course.,so

37260_2,I think that people have the idea that people that are different from themselves are wrong.,This is because they do something you wouldn't or believe something you don't.,because
42729_4,after that tragedy we always had a certain idea of what Muslim people are like.,Basim does not hold the same grudge and does not judge the American people as one whole.,and
26889_3,It affects real people.,It does not matter where they are from.,and

27521_1,People losing their lives.,People losing their families.,Nan
33118_1,I thought that we might hear from Basim.,Basim tied to convince us that life isn't all bad in Afghanistan.,and

37525_3,Why should I stay angry the rest of my life?,He forgave.,so
39939_1,it's surprising how little we know about the world we live in.,We rarely get to know to see into the lives of other people.,and
20494_1,A group of Christians interpret the same line in the Bible in many different ways.,They apply it to their life in different ways.,so

35997_1,It's difficult to use the bible in legal arguments.,When it comes to things as divorce.,because
39623_1,I agree that I am very interested in hearing how the effects of divorce to a person whose parents divorced so quickly like the Quaran says.,This is as opposed to my parents divorce who has been a very long and dragged out process.,Nan
11311_3,Those features allow them to run faster.,They are able to jump higher.,and
41363_4,She provides examples of how the Quran supports that.,It is what more Americans should be hearing.,and

35983_3,They need to be more skeptical of everything.,They need to search for the truth on their own.,and
27769_1,He banned Muslim from the middle east,he is reinforcing their stereotype of terrorist wanting to destroy america,because
22127_1,Religion is confusing.,"No one person will interpret the Bible, Quran, Torah, etc.",and
23077_1,It is very eye opening to me that the civilians hate war.,They want it to end just as much as everyone else does.,and

29520_1,Hearing from LTC Richard Garey was an eye-opening experience.,He mentioned how rare combat was compared to how common many civilians think it is.,because
39983_1,He went on to explain the process of grief that he went through.,he was feeling numb.,Nan
39897_1,His belief that his God must have a plan that is bigger than him is a reminder that everything happens for a reason. ,I think it was important we were reminded of this. ,and

33998_5,in the country that bombed my house  killed my family.Another thing I realized ,was the fact that the reason that Bassim was able to be  kind  forgiving ,so
24256_1,Americans seem to have this prejudice against Afghani people.,They believe that they are bad people who are just trying to cause wars along with perform terrorist acts.,and
34404_4,"I will never know what that is like, the best I can do is try to feel, to connect with people who may have those struggles."," it isnt my job to ever pretend to know, but empathy in many ways can make you more aware, more thoughtful, more insightful,  respectful.",and

11781_1,(family friends) did the ancestry.com test.,All of the children got different results.,and
26987_1,The media is part of the problem.,The media hides the truth behind wars.,because
40749_1, We live in this Christian land.,It is difficult for us to see things objectively.,and
40113_3,Much more of a patriarchal society.,Than what we have here in America.,and
19369_1,I guessed Italian due tf the skin color/ the dark hair.,I was wrong.,because
37413_1,I agree with your idea about we have to find a common ground between other culture and my culture.,Understanding cultures will make it easier to relate.,so
32851_2,My opinion is very objective., It doesn't work well in these responses.,and
34697_1,He said he did not hate Americans.,He said he loved the American people he had contact with.,and
35505_1,I can say that I have a different attitude empathy.,This is due to Bassims story.,because
39238_3,Anger would've consumed him internally.,I increasingly respect his refusal to hate.,because
29036_2,it have been losing their lives over a war.,it probably should have ended long ago.,Nan
19449_1,It's about war.,It's somewhat about the minds of people.,and
39995_3,Being able to understand other cultures.,Being able to understand other religions.,and

39182_2,It really shows the extent of how someones faith can help them.,In horrible times it allows them to be at peace.,and
27572_2,I began to realize that the opposing forces had been intertwined within the public.,It wasnt as simple as being able to drop one bomb and kill only the opposing forces.,Nan
36956_10,I respect Bassim very much.,I admire Bassim very much.,so
39632_4,Touched upon in our labs. ,just how much people thought wrong of this statement.,and
38334_3,She hands out St. Jude prayer cards,She is a big believer in his message.,because
34363_2,That the bible says it is wrong.,We never really were told to read the bible.,and
36324_3,The first step to getting rid of this ignorance is to inform ourselves of the places that go beyond America.,Life is not only in the United States.,because
13796_1,Many times people think badly of other races.,They just dont know people from that given race.,because
28810_1,The religious literatures have been translated over the years.,They have perhaps been somewhat modified.,and
27480_2,Rafi spoke about how most Muslims want peace.,Rafi spoke about how these terrorists were not a representation of all of them.,and
38288_1,He proves the stereotype.,People who live in the Middle East are all violent.,and
34312_1,All of these incidents are the result of the United States government's actions.,They have taken a toll on every single person in Mosul.,and
35721_2,"Like Bassim's family, I believe that this is fear.",Many civilians have in these areas that are constantly in war.,and
34942_2,which is selfish than to notice.,realize that we should be doing more to help out other countries who are struggling way more than us.,and
36212_3,Basim Razzo gave me new insight on how we should move forward.,He allowed me to be at ease with problems that I have fought against in my past.,and
39851_2,the number one reason why there is  conflict is violence.,the number one reason why there is  racism in the world is  our ignorance towards cultures that are different from our own.,and
15879_1,That image got me thinking. ,About Mexican people and people from South America. ,Nan
14369_1,It kills bacteria.,It seals cuts.,and
19646_1,I think it is human nature to want to protect your family in times of danger.,It's human nature to just run away from all of it.,and
26704_4,It is so normal to think it's right.,If it was Muslim first how many red flags that would have.,and
32174_2,Basim's entire life was changed by a moment of horror that was caused by the United States.,We did not hear anything about it.,and
37851_1,He has no set game plan for lectures.,That is due to the social climate of this country.,and
34460_1, I did forgive America causing me  all the travesties.,to whatever is left of my family.,and
28806_2,There has never been a time in my life.,I knew there was no war occurring in Afghanistan.,because

36067_1,Many others began to take a step back.,Many try to understand someone else's story.,and
39853_1,"On one hand, trying to learn about new culture takes effort.",To understand a completely new culture takes effort,and
35117_1,I still love my religion.,I will most likely be a Catholic until the day I die.,and
24727_1,I did not realize that the people of the country are very similar to us Americans. ,"Especially when he said they have children, aspirations, jobs and hopes",Nan
23906_2,It seems incredulous that as a society we're still using the books today.,Those books don't specifically denote word for word laws that are used today based on interpretation.,because
36799_5,That's completely understandable,"  I were to encounter the same things Basim had, I definitely wouldnt be accepting",because
15944_1,The core concept of this class is about making connections to and with people.,It is about finding distinctions/traits that allow us to figure out how to understand how people other than ourselves tick.,and
40368_1,Our military goes overseas to protect us.,It causes complete chaos and devastation.,Nan
22836_1,I don't feel that we should judge others.,They believe or interpret something different than we do.,because
38254_1,"With my feelings towards this, I admire Bassim greatly",I am so thankful that he spoke to the class about his feelings towards what happened.,and
40837_1,"Going through the 20th through 21st centuries, war changes.",It was something that existed on battlefields. ,and
41770_2,I see how other people think.,I see how they like to express their feelings.,and
25544_1,The Quran does not have exact references to all grievances.,Lawyers try to interpret the Quran laws into new laws.,so
23038_1,The Bible will not give explicit answers for all of our complex ethical questions of today.,There is no way of knowing thousands of years ago some of the ethical dilemmas we face today.,because
40035_6,He might even repeat it in conversation.,even though they know very little about the topic.,and
42102_2,I am bewildered how people bluster confidently.,I am bewildered how people bluster authoritatively.,and
31683_3,It will forever be remembered.,"That one is the terrorist attack on New York's Twin Towers on September 11, 2001.",and
41956_3,All five bridges were bombed.,It's hard to get across the river.,so
38987_1,He explained how he had lived in the United States  8 years.,he has friends who are American.,and
26990_2,There are many people.,And Organisations that take part in Violence,Nan
30632_1,My only input is that not everyone is perfect.,"As humans, we are going to make mistakes.",and
33159_3,They took his everything. ,He still lives on. ,and
36653_1,I find it difficult to understand the ongoing altercations.,I have limited knowledge.,and
21584_1,The media only shares what it knows will get it views.,It shares what it knows will get people to come back.,and
39112_1,I'm glad people like Bassim reached out to Sam., He can tell his story of whats going on over in Mosul in general.,so
40722_2,He incorporates religion into how he deals with sadness. ,He uses his religion to forgive. ,and
34656_2,The bombing destroyed a city.,The soldiers left the city in rubble.,and
11428_3,Money affects being good at a sport.,Culture affects being good at a sport.,and
33879_1,I thought this from the movies I have watched.,"Also, from articles I have read in the past.",and
41445_2,So could political inteference.,Those traditions may have actually worked in the past.,and
30299_1,The issue of race that weve learned about is very similar to the issue of religion in the world.,There are slight differences that cause such great issues to people.,so
11404_3,His family did not feel as though she was good enough.,She wasn't black.,because
35783_2,Many choose to find answers.,Many choose to find peace in holy scriptures.,and
33565_6, I learned a lot from watching that video.,well reading about your personal story.,and
38797_1,Him speaking makes it real.,we hear about bombings in the middle east all the time on the news.,Nan
24649_1,I think the last guess would be in Afghanistan.,There are misconceptions of that area.,because
36074_1,Sam clarifies what he is discussing.,It is not an attack.,and
8887_1,"One of the million basketball courts in the city, to find ice rink hopefully you all have the hockey equipment necessary.",want to play some hockey?,and
34554_2,My favorite part was when Sam had the other volunteers try them on.,The one girl mentioned how the hijab made her less worried about her appearance.,because
25906_1,"In the mind of those I knew in my youth, abortion was seen as a crime by the mother and doctor.",They believed the mother and doctor should be punished by prison.,Nan
10465_1,People are looking to date in other races. ,It's exotic is not right.,and
27507_2,Sam actually cares.,He puts in so much attention to easily tell the difference between traits.,and
26949_3,People have sinned.,One message that is a central theme of the bible is to love your neighbor.,because
39735_3,keep on going.,he has to forgive.,and
38482_1,Hearing Basim's story was absolutely heartbreaking.,Here's the worst part.,and
22856_1,Being able to experience German culture was very eye-opening to me., I would like to continue to gain new experiences in new places.,and
31077_1,The lecture was very eye-opening to me.,It enabled me to see the ways I have wrongly labeled an entire population of people.,because
38925_6,Many have been through absolute tragedy.,"Instead of taking anextremist path, they use Islam to heal and as a light through dark times.",so
11931_1,Show them were more alike than they think.,There's nothing wrong with it.,and
31606_1,This is completely wrong.,Only a select group of people are committing these horrible crimes.,because
31138_2,we can view sharia law differently,it sounds different or they way of following seems different,because
41676_2,This class is really helping me gain perspective on religion.,This class is really helping me gain perspective on race.,and
38496_4,I never thought that the U.S. would bomb a resident's home.,Learning that this happens a lot was completely devastating to me.,so
9595_2, Learning can occur at any time.,I believe that the only constraint on learning that we have is ourselves.,and
31841_1,Your home is destroyed.,Your family is taken from you.,and
15782_2,Black and brown people get stuck with more of the negative roles.,They get stuck with roles like drug dealers.,and
30335_1,Everyone who thinks like this has just not explored the world .,The possibilities they have!,and
15472_1,Race issues in the U.S. give it a bad reputation.,They can be a main cause of large division here in the states.,and
37910_1,Hearing him talk about his stages of grief.,HIs goal of forgiveness was unreal.,and
24635_3,I was raised Catholic.,I was somewhat forced to live by the church ideals.,Nan
42049_3,He lost his daughter.,He lost his brother.,and
42458_6,Not everyone wanted to be involved in the war.,yet people still hate them and their German descendants.,Nan
36775_1,The media never discusses Christian extremists., people that  they should do horrific acts to justify their religion.,and
36847_3,We are able to raise a family in this country.,We tend to look past all the negativity that America is causing.,and
25690_2,Their core values are the same with majority of the people around the world.,"The values are family; work ,wealth.",and
13502_1,One thing that stuck out was people staying in their own regions.,People were not leaving.,and
30519_7,People discriminate against homosexuals due to their lifestyle.,goes against someone elses religion.,because
7835_1,It should be taught and known that race doesnt matter.,It is just a concept that humans have made up,Nan
27812_3,"I've noticed to many of us that are international, from different countries and cultures.",Is common sense.,Nan
19825_1,I thought it was almost half fighting.,The other half keeping order among the people.,and
16265_1,Rafi was a guest speaker.,He fit the description of a peaceful man who lives in Afghanistan.,and
21627_1,"I agree with you, Isabella.",The world moving in the direction of mixed races is great regarding humanity.,Nan
30781_1,That's why I feel like there should be no arguments surrounding.,This all deals with personal preference.,because
34251_1,"Obviously, I have never been in that situation.","God willing, I will never have to be in that situation.",and
31354_1,The Bible's teachings will always be important.,As the world changes faith needs to account for these changes as well.,Nan
40910_2,I heard about his family.,I realized his family is no different than my own.,Nan
23702_1,I personally feel like I wouldn't be receptive.,I would not be open with them.,and
25287_1,My personal relationship with my religion and faith is what led me to see Sam's argument so easily.,I already mostly believed it myself.,because
41240_1,That was the only thing left for him.,It is amazing that he was able to find peace with this.,Nan
37181_1,This prevents us from finding about the truth about our country.,the actually news we should be focusing on like how our government bombed Bassim's house.,and
25111_1,They find parts of the Bible that support their beliefs.,They use religion as their backbone.,and
42485_3,He’s trying to show us how to understand their culture. ,He’s trying to show us what it should be. ,and
23609_1,You made a lot of good points in your post.,I agree with a lot of what you said!,and
31299_1,I think this causes many issues.,I think this causes conflict to arise.,and
39936_3,They are thought of basically the same by many Americans (I was guilty of this myself for the majority of my life).,These past few weeks have been an excellent way of showing that that isn't the case. ,and
22240_1,People are unwilling to actually research culture and people.,They should not only read about it.,and
7521_1,"We place excessive blame today's society, our lack of communication about equality.",Our general has done a better job in achieving more racial equality than ever before.,so
40029_3,By the end of this class I had developed a serious respect towards Basim.,Felt grateful to him.,and
9166_1,They're far richer than the United States.,There are several African countries that have a higher economic growth rate than we do.,and
24107_1,They will take a scripture they want.,They will take away the meaning they want.,and
42697_1,I cannot imagine the pain that Basim has been through., the pain that Basim has been through in the years following the bombing.,Nan
41098_2,It is extremely controversial.,Each viewpoint brings a fair argument to the table.,because
29369_2,it gives a bad reputation to all Muslims in media., where they are  often talked poorly about.,and
40810_1,Bassim taught a classroom of college kids.,Lessons we would never get otherwise.,Nan
36956_7,I respect Bassim very much.,I admire Bassim very much.,and
40351_1,China had massive wars.,Genocides every 50 years.,so
37047_4,we should encourage learning to engage in a battle of arguments.,we should  not encourage a battle of weapons .,and
21328_1,I personally would not feel comfortable speaking my opinion in this setting.,I commend those that do.,so
10825_1,"Most of the time, it's not always something we are aware of.",We may be inclined to assume a reality of someone.,Nan
14811_2,I was never able to talk freely about it.,I was never able to get a good understanding about it. ,and
36380_4,"Other people see, not worse than we do.",People have sense of fear every single day of their lives.,and
41041_3,Tthe foreign policy of other countries are so different from ours.,It makes them view America as having one type of goal and mode of operating.,Nan
36824_1,"I know the bible, any religious book.","the is not meant to be taken  literally ,word to word.",so

42717_3,I cant say that I know how I would feel. ,I have never had an experience like Bassims in my life. ,because
29277_4,Hair offers protection from the UV rays.,"Otherwise, sun would kill them.",so
30256_2,People realize some things are outdated.,People realize this upon reading the Bible.,and
12068_2,This is something that I think is talked about and stereotyped often.,No one actually makes the case with the understanding of why things are the way they are.,and

32860_2,"The Christian, this lecture somewhat made me uncomfortable, ",Sam was pointing out facts about Christianity that ,because
9733_2,And become more aware of the implications we make.,When we as a society group people together by skin color because that is not what should define us.,and
41141_1,The book you speak of is excellent.,I enjoyed reading it very much.,and
39299_2,The only way to fix a problem like this.,Inform people of things they many not know.,and
36916_4,It teaches that is similar to lots of other religions too.,This shows the similarity of people with different cultures.,and
34790_1,Basim's story is something I couldn't imagine.,"his strength to not be angry, is something that I will not forget.",and
42264_3,It was meant to make people look at something from a different perspective.,I feel as if it's working.,and

34229_2,The courage that he has shown.,Since that devastating day in his life.,and
31188_4,I thought the class on Sharia Law was informative.,It is a term that is widely used so often in a negative way.,because
33804_3,every single person was talking about it., social media platform was talking about it.,and
41655_2,LinkI feel it is essential to not generalize certain races.,you should put yourself in their shoes and look through a different perspective,and
38986_1,He explained that he is upset over it.,There was some anger at first.,and
8096_1,I found the reasoning behind the different accents fascinating.,The way language is such a dynamic entity is fascinating.,and
35541_1,He may not have had hope about the future of Mosul or even his country., There were still aspects of his life he enjoyed.,and
31757_1,"The term bring back is often used in the arguments of people including religion into the classroom, which completely ignores what this country",was founded onthe separation of Church  government.,and
28697_5,Interpretations a person could have once reading the New Testament.,One person doesn't experience life like others do.,and
29913_3,it is surprising to me that even with such a small income.,every year they  quick to buy gifts to all  this visit.,so
36273_1,I was meeting him for the first time. ,I had no idea about his background. ,and

35755_2,Some people associate Islam with dangerous actions.,Some individuals that follow it adopt the prechings.,and
13446_2,Regarding having  issues trying to speak about race where you come from.,I struggle with that.,because
15258_1,The media portrays certain issues.,The media takes stuff out of context. ,and
36556_1,It is not alarming to me that someone who has a faith background handles a devastating situation like his in the way he did. ,"I think it brings up important questions about what role religion plays in someones life, no matter what religion they identify themselves with.",Nan
15158_5,We would have to travel to see those places in person.,it is truly a life changing experience.,and
34080_3,That actually digs deep.,Goes beyond.,and
13463_1,I grew up in majority white community.,I have never really been in a position where I was considered a minority.,and
34217_2,other materialistic possessions.,to a bomb.,and
10671_1,I honestly think they are then going out in the world to try to spin things.,They are trying to guilt others into thinking they are racist.,because

26289_1,We have an obligation of learn about this stuff.,It is our country.,Nan
27768_1,There is another thing that I think contributes to this.,It involves the recent actions of President Trump.,and
15089_3,She felt uncomfortable.,Being around many people that were not black.,so
20835_1,We had a large amount of discussion about the government and religion.,We discussed all of the checks on it from the establishment clause to the Lemon test.,and
13369_1,It's taught me to look for these racial images.,It's taught me not to be deceived by them.,and
8645_4,I felt guilty for misidentifying others.,Guilt doesn't make sense.,Nan
11528_2,The govenment needs to strip the constitutional rights of organizations based on racism.,It should strip them for those with unethical values.,and
12293_1,It dehumanized people.,It caused so many people to not live the free life they should have lived.,and
34913_1,Everyone has their own way of religion.,Everyone has their own way of living life.,and
22759_1,"In my opinion, not any holy scripture should be used to help determine things.",Not all have the same beliefs anymore.,because
39148_1,We can do nothing and get angry.,We can live with hate every day.,and
33373_4,"People, set in their ways, are not easy to change.",It is not easy to accept other peoples views.,because
22502_2,It's purely a religious argument.,People don't seem to get this.,Nan
15371_2,We could also analyze the size and shape of eyes.,It becomes easier to identify where someone could be from.,Nan

26840_1,You hear all the time in the news about all these bombings.,ISIS is a huge threat,and
16397_1,It was tough to see the numbers increasing in recent years of.,Afghan citizens killed.,Nan
39774_1,the thing that caught my attention during this lecture.,"we have all come to love , call home the United states",and
41387_1,"Hey Lauren, I agree with what you said .",You said about attaching an issue with a face and an actual person that we can speak to.,Nan
29023_3,These certain people view themselves a certain way.,"These people view their religion a certain way, too.",and
11150_5,We see pictures of starving people., and disease ridden people of color.,and
14986_1,I believe black athletes are better at sports.,This is due to the way they were raised. ,because
24767_1,We can learn about each other's differences.,It can make each of us better people.,and

37211_3,I do not need to know what celebrities are doing., I would feel much more impacted to be  I was told about the struggle people face all over the world.,and
30107_1,I think it was really refreshing to see the similarities between Islam and Christianity side-by-side,I had never really thought of them as alike before,Nan
39940_2,We all have different experiences.,We all have different feelings.,and
15412_2,India has cultrual diversity.,USA has racial differences.,because
9091_1,Raising awareness is another tool.,"There are some people who will probably never let go of their nationalist, white supremacist, hateful views.",because
40976_1,This is almost like the extremists of Isis.,The extremists are trying to rid these western countries of non-extremists.,and
15669_8,We are moving towards., a less discriminatory country.,and
41175_3,Empathy is important. ,Empathy is important about sensitive issues. ,and
19831_1,Rafi is a very gentle guy.,He doesn't deserve to live like that.,and
40447_1,I was honored to hear him share his story.,He was strong after his life was shattered.,and
38130_3,My family is so important to me.,I do not know what I would do if I ever lost them.,because
27586_2,He told us very different stories than the ones LTC Garey shared.,The face of the war and mission has changed.,and
8811_3,They lost WWII.,They must be bad,so
20209_1,We can try to be like the accepting people.,I also think we have to realize that some people will just never act like that.,and
14588_1,I believe stereotyping about race is unfair.,People could be from any part of the world and look like they may be from another corner of the globe.,because
26468_1,I wish him the best.,I also hope Sam has him in class again before the semester ends.,and
38652_2,I could not imagine having someone come to my house.,I could not imagine having someone set all of these rules which are unconstitutional.,so
22011_4,My partner and I recalled the crossing of the land bridge.,We knew that's why the groups of people in that slide all looked similar.,and
39367_1,I'm from Jersey.,I know corruption. ,and
22834_3,"There are rules about sex, abortion, alcohol, divorce and much more in each of these practices.",The only difference is how those rules are interpreted.,Nan
38523_2,We are vulnerable to whatever ideas the group has.,We are vulnerable to their biases.,and
23810_2,They value charity.,They value helping the unfortunate.,and
11153_2,They spend their entire life in LA. ,They have never seen the ocean.,Nan
33037_2,Basim was affected first hand by American violence.,"Basim was affected by American violence first hand, but he remains a certain way.",Nan

21360_2,He brought up that we all claim to be Christian.,We want to interpret the Bible literally.,and
22517_1,It was truly a humbling experience.,It gave me a whole new angle on the war.,and

38012_1,Watching this lecture gave me a throught-provoking question.,Do we really need religion?,Nan
23408_1,Because we do things like we did to Bassim.,Then don't talk or care about it.,and
23005_1,It is easy to put different groups of people into little boxes.,That's all we think.,and

15346_1, I never really knew that a person's nose could tell of where their ancestors came from.,I found that to be fascinating.,so
10085_1,I think that the people who were criticizing Hayden were very naive.,I would even dare to say they lacked the courage to debate him in front of the class.,and
30448_1,We reach out.,We listen to more people like Rafi.,and
41736_1,Some reason he does not seem bothered by the Islamophobic president.,He feels like the policies will remain the same any way.,because

31742_3, I would always hear stories from the media that women aren't allowed to walk in public without a man beside them voice their opinion in front of a group of men,But I found it super interesting that women are allowed to divorce their husbands.,because

37486_3,It was easy for me to be familiar with the statements. ,I have heard them before. ,because
29649_2, it ties into a little bit of what was talked about during the Black Devils lecture concerning the Reconstruction Era  more specifically.,even the initial devastation of the war itself was over.,because
33685_1,I remember talking to my friend this week about the hijabi lecture we had.,I thought it was amazing.,and

42716_3,It was a call to a group of students from this country.,Our government took everything from him.,Nan
19204_1,This is important. ,It really brings a big military operation down to a really humanistic manner.,because

29420_2," it's just eye opening to see how similar our human race is, ", it makes me question why we have to blow things out of proportion that,so
41599_2,They would be more concerned,They would be more willing to help.,and
7583_1,"The proclamation is made that white people are smarter, better due to the fact that they are more evolved.",It makes absolutely no sense.,so
27331_1,I have grown up with military and deploying to the middle east friends,I have seen the war effect on them and their families and friends,so

37954_1,Bassim saying that nothing has changed between the presidencies is shocking.,To me an American citizen I see a difference with each president.,because
27413_3,He doesn't want to relive those again,He is urging everyone to stop fueling the war,and

24144_1,They wonder whether we're only shown the negative things.,They wonder whether we're not shown much of the positives.,and
34228_1,I think one of the hardest things that Bassim had to do in a time like this was to be able to realize that life keeps going on.,"If he kept this anger inside of him, it would eventually consume him.",and

38376_2,I thought it was insane how before the bombing Mosul was a beautiful place, Bassims home was astonishing.,and

21523_1,Personally I did not fully think about how many people are truly affected by war in their everyday lives.,Simply due to the fact that the war in Afghanistan is hundreds of miles away from my own home.,because
31122_3,It doesnt hinder her in any way.,She was proud to wear it.,and
35700_1,Without the ability to accept difference.,people will never understand each other .,Nan
8227_1,We were supposed to be discussing serious issues,No one should feel like walking on eggshells,Nan
8026_4,Is shows how living in a certain climate shapes people., or location over time shapes people.,and
20701_1,I chose the video clip titled What is War Like for Civilians.,it captures exactly why this class was an important one for me.,because
40206_4,We have been emphasizing other countries.,We are very open.,because
10663_1,I think that people just need to get over the barrier built in their mind.,The barrier says that dating out of your race is weird or even wrong.,Nan
27902_1,One thing tends to happen.,I think.,Nan
11726_5,I do not feel that these are valid responses.,"we cannot claim pride in our ethnic identity as Americans unless we understand, acknowledge, and talk about how we got to where we are today and the expense of whom.",because
15452_1,I believe that one of the problems is that a lot of people feel uncomfortable talking about it.,"On top of that, people do not know how to talk about race when it is the discussion at hand. ",and
31617_1,"However, I've heard the many chilling stories from people about where they were.", what exactly they were doing at that moment in time.,and
39429_4,We must educate ourselves before we make a decision.,We must educate ourselves before we judge someone else.,because
41115_1,It is an all-around cool thing that they got going on.,I hope.,and
33284_1,"When he was explaining what had happened to him and his family, I put myself in his position.",All I could imagine was the intense burning anger I would feel.,and
22138_1,It makes me happy that they are positive.,At the same time I feel upset because they will have to deal with the stress of living in a war zone as they grow up into beautiful girls.,so
9768_1,Sam even goes on to say we are all genetically 99.9% the same.,How can one race say they are head over heels better than the rest.?,so
27701_3,Whenever I would come home my parents would instill in me different lessons.,"Because of this I was a very young, naive, little kid growing up.",and
15507_1,Social media platforms provide information.,We have information at our fingertips.,Nan
33810_1,"Sam started talking about Iraq, Mosul.",I had no prior knowledge to the situation he was about to explain.,and
38062_2,Without questioning the agenda of the information.,Whether or not there is a certain bias.,and
20489_1,The idea that Sam was trying to convey here is something that really resonates with me.,It's something I feel very strongly about as well.,and
34918_1,It would be very tough to lose just one family member.,to lose your whole family all at once is just unimaginable.,Nan
39793_1,We learn about how giving their culture is.,We learn about how caring their culture is.,and
40443_2,At the hands of another country.,For no reason.,Nan
38731_1,Here is a man speaking in front of 750 students.,He is in a country where so many hate his religion.,Nan
10655_1,It is interesting.,"Randomly, where we ended up on earth is what determined the kind of human we would be.",because
36007_1,America ruined everything he had. ,It hardly gave him anything in exchange. ,and
39590_2,That friend resides in Iraq.,He's lived there his whole life.,and
35559_3,Religion is complex.,there is not one right religion.,and
41877_3,The government does bad things.,Its hard to acknowledge.,and
35257_1,I found Sams lecture about Christian Sharia.,one his most interesting lessons this year.,so
10010_1,As you said things are not brought out to light as they should.,I think you will see more issues that were once kept hidden just addressed. ,and
26885_2,People think things are negative regarding Afghanistan.,People think things are complicated regarding Afghanistan.,and
10139_1,I highly doubt we are the only country with racism.,I just think that our country is more open/ sometimes extreme(i.e KKK / Neo-nazis) about how the feel towards people of different races.,and
23969_2,Running a country is different.,"Laws need to be based on logical, modern day standards.",and
31586_1,I really respect the fact that you took the time to read the bible.,Not many people take the effort to read the bible.,so
25014_1,I thought that Sam bringing Rafi was a great move,I don't think that many people had ever met an Afghan person.,because
42066_5,You can stay angry to make life more difficult.,You can move on to live a more happy life.,and
28902_2,On the tactical level things can vary between areas of operations.,On the strategic level it's essentially the same.,and
33239_2,That is why I think we should be thankful everyday for the life we have.,I am from Panama.,and
33635_2,someone had lost their family.,everything due to the bombing.,and
37962_1,Double check things.,Make sure they are correct.,and
31035_1,It talks about destruction.,It talks about things that will happen to you if you disobeyed your leader.,and
9878_1,There is zero logic behind any of their beliefs.,They should not be given the attention they hope for.,and
11413_1,People have seen Afghanistan on the news.,Thats how they form their opinion.,and
40341_4,One could even consider calling themselves.,someone from another religion.,Nan
8446_3,One province from another province.,One family from another family.,Nan
39311_3,Will be more important.,Than members of someone else's.,Nan
11447_1,He escaped communist rule to Spain,He came to the United States.,and
26129_1,I am also saying this as an atheist.,I was raised Jewish.,Nan
31544_4,Which it is up to the free will of his creations to take the bibles examples,teachings to lead their own lives,and
25092_1,That is not exactly what caused me to become disenfranchised with Catholicism only,I felt that I could separate them from the church that I went to.,because
14963_1,Indian society and country should be looked at.,It should be seen through the prism of where it's going.,and
42359_1,I got a message from this lecture. ,It was that we cannot change the world without understanding. ,Nan
21262_4,He put up slides that were real cars just like any other country.," but when a lot of people think of Afghanistan they dont think these things they think of war, poverty, and the country being destroyed.",Nan
22100_2,These people would come back.,They have such a positive view of Afghanistan.,and
33675_2,Basim says in Islam he is told to forgive.,Islam led Basim to this realization of forgiveness.,and
32285_1,I am familiar with Saudi culture.,I am familiar with Saudi culture due to a prior Penn State film class.,because
25770_4,They were singled out.,They realized that the bible also excluded many other groups of people.,Nan
26705_3,he said people are wrong,he is trying to make us a christian nation,and
32562_1,"I believe we should learn from the Bible, Quran, or Torah.",We should use what we learn to help us live morally.,and
19453_1,"We surround ourselves with people who look, act, think like us.",We only learn about other people through the media.,so
42165_1,I have learned not to stereotype races.,There is much more to each person than the color of their skin.,so
30233_1,Putting in place legislation that discriminates against.,"a certain community ignored the idea of the separation between church, state.",and
8311_2,I believe the answer lies more in the rinsing and repeating of top athlete creating.,Sort of a long term sports evolution systej at the top level of play.,Nan
35964_1,Everything that Basim said was really interesting.,I plan on keeping up with what happens in Mosul.,and
40206_2,We have been emphasizing other religions.,We have been emphasizing other countries.,because
29564_1,Another question surface,how we can overcame dishonesty in some media to better educate United States population,and
10068_2,They have no understanding of what is going on outside their border.,"They are a harsh, cold people.",Nan
15723_1,I remember being with her.,We approached a group of my Latino friends.,and
8431_1," With hockey you need a puck, sticks, goals.",With hockey you need an ice rink to play.,and
26474_1,Change can only occur with action.,That is something that needs to happen.,and
15459_1,I believe that the race card can be abused only when used as a crutch.,It enforces a learned helplessness attitude.,Nan
30582_3,It is just so hard for me to grasp a government style that is run interwoven with religion.,America has so many different religions yet none of them interfere with laws.,because
42445_6,You go out.,You explore.,and
20096_1,This does nothing but hinder that individual.,It hinders the people around them.,and
39842_4,We complain about foreigners invading our land.,We do the same to other people.,and
28924_1,I found these statistics alarming.,I believe those views to be radical.,because
19176_3,The same amount of people that participated in the Civil Rights Movement need to come together.,They need to demand that things change.,and
10406_2,Naturally the athletes they idolize has a major influence on which they one(s) they choose to participate in growing up.,Naturally the sport the most folks in your community play has a major influence on which they one(s) they choose to participate in for leisure.,so
10741_1,Those answers are no less correct.,Those answers are immensely relevant.,Nan
31327_2,I realized there are so many holes in it.,I realized it sometimes contradicts itself.,and
25846_1,I understand that the Religious Freedom Bills are made to discriminate against the LGBTQ community., That is not right I disagree with part of the example he read us during class.,and
31593_2,We associate those same events based on an interpretation of the Koran with Muslims.,We associate an interpretation of the Koran with their culture.,and
39677_1,Losing  many relatives  must be extremely devastating., I can't imagine the pain that Bassim must have been going through,and
38719_1,A foreign government came to my land in search of my resources.,My life was destroyed.,and
28490_1,That comment Sam said about War being a real thing and not just out there really struck me.,I've always just thought of it as something out there.,because
16407_4,This makes me upset that we stereotype these people. ,We stereotype their country with a negative connotation . ,and
34676_1,America is far more self-sustaining.,the international dynamic America has with the rest of the world is come to our shores.,and
23654_1,There are many things said in the Bible.,"Sam mentions such as how you should marry, how you should eat food, how you should raise your children.",so
33938_5,I belive Basim losing his child is hard to understand in America.,We could never imagine a random bomb dropping on our house.,because
29607_3,We think Afghanistan to have limited resources.,"The Afghan people aspire to live productive, fulfilling lives.",and
35149_1,His discussion was of being out in the wilderness.,This changes you,and
12477_1,So many people around the world making these claims made it easy for people to buy into it.,This allowed them to not feel like monsters for what they were doing.,and
40596_3,People refuse to think a step further. ,They would rather put someone different in a category. ,and
12255_1,I grew up with white teachers.,I was the only person in my class on the day I learned about slavery.,and
30149_6,"The idea covered the use of violence, killing in self-defense, too.",His idea wondered whether all the ideas were followed through the use of the Bible/Quran.,and
36167_4,This time could be used to do many other good things.,There are a lot of positive things that we can get done by not hating.,so
8533_1,I observed in every town I visited that the locals all looked very different.,Attention to detail is key in talking about race.,and
34023_4,He did not build prejudice about American people.,Americans should be able to get rid of their prejudice about people practicing Islam.,and
20347_1,"You live in this county, you have worldview.",I do not understand empathy.,and
39498_2,An individual must be strong to speak to hundreds of students on a personal tragedy.,Speaking on a personal tragedy requires much courage.,so
40741_3,The American government should reflect the actions of the American people.,This was on them.,and
7530_1,Sam picked out Jefton randomly.,Sam had him pick out someone.,and
30678_1,I still have my faith.,I attend mass as often as I am able.,and
40858_2,I don't mean to speak of it as if it's a last resort.,I don't mean to speak of it as if it's a plan to calm people down.,and
39602_1, I never even thought about that aspect of the war.,All we tend to think of in war is it is America versus the bad guys.,and
42385_2,It teaches us to dig deeper beyond what is at the surface., it teaches  to understand each other on a basic human level.,and
15362_1,This was a very intriguing exercise.,The exercise shined a light on the snap judgment people can make.,Nan
41725_5,He finds solace in our country's people.,He funneled his anger toward our government.,and
30512_1,I am glad that Sam talked about this subject.,It allowed me to remember everything I learned over the past few years.,and
33024_1,"It was refreshing to see, being a Muslim.",two holy books compared side by side.,so
29512_2,It is very eye opening to the injustices in the world.,Injustices that are not usually represented in the news media.,because
40596_5,They would rather put someone different in a category. ,They would rather move on. ,and
22745_1,They are also hypocritical in that talk about the first amendment.,They are also hypocritical in that talk about he right to free speech.,Nan
25864_1,Many radical christians do not know it.,The teachings in the Quran and Bible are very similar.,Nan
11290_2,They don't necessarily like it.,Their parents or family members want them to play that sport.,because
42356_1,I always try to see the arguments from both sides.,This class has opened my eyes to many more issues around that world.,and
42444_2,You can believe in whatever you want.,You have strong points you have made own your own.,because
36271_2,He said he uses his religion to guide him not only through everyday life.,He uses his religion to guide him in trying situations.,and
32485_1,"Today, everyone is committing sins like those.",It seems impossible for anyone to go to heaven.,and
34123_2,I want to be less focused on what other people are doing.,It is so easy to judge other people. ,and
9168_1,There are white impoverished people. ,There are black impoverished people.,and
36734_1,I think Merve has a great point.,She brings up how Sam helps us view people as human beings.,Nan
39179_4,"There was no response with aggression,nor hatred, during this horrible incident.",He has been able to see the positive to overcome any misery. ,and
40928_2,The news says negative things to divide.,It is to sway public opinion.,and
36991_10,we can all learn from him.,forgive more not being angry.,and
39424_4,He is spreading such a message of hope.,Everyone should make a note of.,and
9735_1,I chose this clip due to vividly remembering this moment in class.,The feeling contradicted with my own thoughts on this topic.,because
8146_2,Now media is so prominent in everyday life.,I believe the negativity travels quicker.,Nan
35406_2,I see someone who went through many challenges.,I see someone that went through many difficulties.,so
29895_2,who i wonder how that,which aspect plays out in Afghanistan,so
36009_1,I am really glad that Basim has allowed Sam to open up to us about his story.,I think that it is really eye opening to see how quick someone else's life can be ruined in a matter of seconds.,because
38567_1,After the conservative party (BJP) came to rule.,There has been a lot of violence from the many Hindu groups in India.,Nan
15221_1,There are many problems America has with race now.,This question is redundant.,so
12381_2,What makes him wrong?,What makes him right?,so
40995_1,We get very wrapped up in the wars that we are fighting.,We only look at the extremists.,and
28991_1,These people are the ones that inspire the misconceptions ,that  we have about the multiple religions.,Nan
19968_1,Forgiveness is something that helps you feel better., I do not believe we can truly forgive in drastic circumstances unless we forget.,and
29998_1," Christians believe Jesus Christ was born on Christmas Day, ", we celebrate that day.,so
41607_2,he explained that a United States soldier had never heard of Iraq.,he was there ruining lives.,and
23444_1,Lieutenant Colonel Gary had to explain.,Lieutenant Colonel Gary had to give examples to support.,and
29832_1,"In this video, Sam is talking about how broad both of these books are.", how differently they can both be interpreted.,and
34857_1,I think it's interesting.,Religion can give people forgiveness.,so
21089_2,Our minds will generalize the opposing country often times.,"It is easier than thinking about the civilians, who are just like us, being negatively affected by the wars.",so
32945_1,You are moved by that is great.,You are educating yourself is great.,so
39825_2,How he feels with his life.,What has happened was truly a tragedy.,because
36544_2, it's important to note that this bible was written  long ago., the technology we would have.,and
15376_3,Both parties do have to project what is on their mind.,Not what someone wants to hear.,Nan
15730_2,Educating people would help end unjust bias.,Educating people would help end ethnocentrism.,and
38280_2,It is easy to feel sympathy.,You feel it when hearing about an event.,Nan
36278_5,I feel that my eyes are opened.,We communicated by discussing debates in class.,and
14959_1,It has been outlawed since independence in 1947.,Those who did belong to the lower castes get special reservations from the government.,and
36400_4,feel that  people should  take time to understand people of different religious backgrounds,understanding people from different socioeconomic  will lead to increased tolerance hence less fighting.,and
34348_1,I hold the dumbest grudges.,Bassim can forgive the United States.,and
41812_2,"Now, what Sam says sort of makes you think of the current ideology you have about the world.",He brings up this idea that people usually do not want to talk about.,and
41508_1,There are things going on all across the world. ,There is not just war. ,and
32991_1,In the past class Sam brings up a good point.,there is a lot of Islamic phobia and distortion of how we see things,Nan
10521_1,"Just like you, I'm proud of my heritage.",I didn't feel the need to discuss it.,Nan
30879_1,These people are truly against someone they shouldn't be backed by our government.,Who is a representation of the people.,because
29412_1,I think that using those religious books to govern nations causes problems.,many modern problems are not addressed.,because
10494_4,White guys think in the same way.,They think black guys play basketball.,because
35326_2,Sam talked about how the various radical Islamic groups.,Follow the same scriptures.,Nan
30118_4,It is interesting that people are continually insistent that gay marriage should be illegal.,Delving into the Bible/Quran shows something else.,and
37889_1,I agree with what you were saying.,Sometimes it is just easier to sugar coat life.,Nan
34532_2,When you said how hard it is to put oneself in Bassims position.,In many ways we can only get a sliver of what he must have faced.,Nan
23630_1,I could agree more with someone of a different religion.,I could struggle to agree with someone of my own religion.,and
35845_1,Bassim truly opened my eyes to the truth.,I see what is happening in other countries due to war.,Nan
38093_4,we have class to discuss what happened.,what we think about the issue  talk 5 mins about it  continue on to what was planned for that class period.,and
40375_1,His religion believes in forgiveness.,That's what he did. ,and
23794_1,There will be people who are knowledgeable about the Afghan culture.,There will be people who have the resources to protect the Afghans.,and
32601_1,"One thing that bothered me from this class, was the fact that the U.S was responsible killing his family.", our government barely even acknowledged the amount of pain.,and
36582_4,Its getting us to do exactly what Sam wants us to do. ,it gets us talking.,Nan
25744_2,People in the Middle East seem to not care.,They are so generous.,Nan
20092_2,They were taken from him.,His brother and nephew were taken when the army bombed both houses.,and
11977_3,We can educate people.,"Whether you're black, Asian, or Guatemalan, we are all 99.9% the same. ",Nan
35840_1,I think everyone can learn a lot.,From the way he deals such awful situations.,and
9359_2,It made me see that we are not too different from each other.,Also at the same time we stereotype and misjudge people.,Nan
35637_1,It put a lot of things in perspective for me.,It really showed me something.,because
40882_1,We should just work harder in the U.S.,We should not be reliant on foreign oil.,so
28005_4,The other could allow us to focus too much on them.,Possibly dividing us even further.,and
36953_1,He went through the worst tragedy anyone can ever imagine.,he found it in his heart to find the good in the American people.,and
39666_1,I can't even imagine growing up in a place like Iraq.,It is constantly ravaged by unending warfare.,Nan
19667_4,"It seems silly, considering Afghan people are humans.",They go shopping like other humans around the world.,and
27867_3,It's an act of pure evil.,It's an act of terrorism.,and
38925_5,Many have been through absolute tragedy.,"Instead of taking anextremist path, they use Islam to heal and as a light through dark times.",and
7593_1,"Different parts of the world have different cultures, styles, make-up, traditions.",Even the food we eat is different.,and
29371_3,"Who know i thought that way , i ws younger time went on",Who grew more aware this class  strengthens that belief.,and
34648_2,the adversities they have endured.,being able to understand.,and
32691_1,"Many people prejudge without ever knowing, living amongst the people they criticize.",People hate others for the wrong reasons.,so
37016_1,This in itself is impacting our awareness.,This is impacting our knowledge. ,and
36307_1,We do not know about the Quran.,A lot of people assume that the Muslim faith allows for these acts of violence. ,so
40401_2,What is on the inside matters.,How they view others is what matters.,and
12359_1,I grew up in a very diverse town.,I have witnessed manyy biracial relationships.,Nan
35217_1,He lost almost everything he ever loved.,He managed to find happiness in his heart.,and
38376_3, Bassims home was astonishing.,After everything that happened.,and
29726_1,We mistakingly assume Afghanistan to be extremely poor everywhere due to the war ., limited resources .,and
32494_3,creating a nation of freedom that is only acceptable,sometimes legal under one religion,and
38921_4,Basim is always trying to do the right thing, follow his religion all while moving on with his life.,and
22609_1,I think that we know that war happens.,We don't really understand how others are affected by it.,Nan
16320_1,"Once you have been there, you would see that Kabul is a place where there are ordinary shops and malls.",They have rush hour traffic that would make traffic in modern cities seem like nothing.,Nan
39177_3,The anger would eat away at him.,It would hurt him more than it would help him.,because
19470_1,I find another point very interesting about the Americans.,"Although they physically resembles Asians, they have their own traditions.",Nan
39045_2,Be able to tell.,Their entire life has revolved around war.,and
27367_1,You believe in and practice the word of God.,You find God does not exist.,and
12067_1,t,This class aims to answer the,and
36090_3,In a normal everyday setting just walking down the street I would never strike up a conversation with a random person.,I would never ask them why they wore what they wore.,because
41093_2,His religion teaches him to forgive.,Christianity also does the same.,and
42303_1,I think that this is crazy.,There are protests and uprisings since the election of President Trump.,because
19515_1,Going thru these situations with somebody can make partners become even closer.,It can tie them up emotionally.,and
12700_2,Without having been given reparations for what has been done.,Are still talking about what has happened to them and to others.,because
29780_2,I thought it was place constantly at war.,"I didn't think much about something in a certain place, though.",and
11562_1,It is complicated.,"It is ugly, just like many other countries in the world.",and
26006_1,Another point I wanted to bring up.,The U.S offered Basim nothing for destroying his home and killing his family members.,Nan
22633_1,It can be hard to see similarities between someone that seems very different than you.,"LTC Garey emphasized that the Afghan people have children,  jobs and aspirations just like we do in America.",so
15758_1,"People need to accept that talking about race can be uncomfortable, awkward, being something new, including scary.",We will never make progress otherwise.,and
37923_1,We choose to think otherwise.,It is seen as incorrect.,and
35950_5,We all share similar qualities.,similar tendencies because we are all people at the end of the day.,and
36166_1,I have to recognize that this is happening.,I have to realize it's not right.,and
11361_1,I definitely believe in the science of evolution.,I just don't know if a god was involved.,Nan
33353_3,"they are Muslim but, I think it might be a slight thought in the back of", my mind that I just wasnt aware of  Sam brought it up.,because
37394_4,He lived his life completely forgiving the individuals who carried out this operation.,That would be unhealthy.,and
22666_1,Do we use the bible as a coping mechanism?, If I believe the bible is telling me xyz then that means I AM RIGHT and it is OKAY to do xyz.,because
21356_3,He brought up that most hate groups in the United States are Christians.,"They think it is what they should do, fight for what God says.",Nan
23893_1,"Kristen, I like you pointing out that civilians in the middle of the war are people just like you.",It's true.,because
34423_5,"it is that we should learn to forgive, to be strong.", and live with kind hearts.,Nan
32038_1,One of The most interesting things i heard was how he had no Hope it to get,better which is deceiving at the same time expected  someone went through,because
41610_2,"I never really thought about the outside world,not on purpose.", I was  preoccupied in my own life to see what was happening in the world around me.,because
36799_9,"  I were to encounter the same things Basim had, I definitely wouldnt be accepting",The people who caused it.,because

39477_1,This portion of class I found to be particularly interesting.,"Once again, I was challenged to look at an aspect of life I was aware of in a whole new life.",because
29615_3,"makes their decisions, all.", they interpreted their own books in a similar way.,because
15597_1,That is why I came to this conclusion.,I certainly agree with what Aleksandra stated.,Nan
15919_2,To have  opportunity.,To prosper in lives.,and
24860_1,"After this lecture, it made me want to take a stand.",I wanted to make some kind of impact about this topic.,and

34777_2,Sam continued the story.,He described what had happened to Basim not long ago.,so
38819_1,It is easy to think that Middle Eastern people are violent. ,We have our own violence right here on our own soil.,and
42019_1,It was amazing to sit in class.,It was amazing to be taught about the middle east.,and
41698_3,I wanted to due to the fact that I found this class to be a certain thing.,I found this class to be interesting.,and
41021_1,"At this point in adulthood, it is difficult to change ones character.",It is difficult to change ones  level of empathy.,and
38647_1,Men also were forced to changed their shorts.,Women had to wear veils.,and
15300_2,I think it is better to have encouraged and sanctioned social media use in class.,Many students will be on their phones anyways.,Nan
40844_1,I like this video a lot.,He brings up American media.,because
36732_4,Basim is attempting to use Islam to forgive Americans for what their government did to his house.,Basim is attempting to use Islam to forgive Americans for what their government did to his family.,and
26835_1,This is the most prominent.,People feel comfortable with those that look like them.,because
23164_3,We won't really know how it feels like,We never had to experience the problem.,Nan
41655_3,LinkI feel it is essential to not generalize certain races.,you should put yourself in their shoes and look through a different perspective,because
40657_2,the casualty numbers are usually high.,casualty numbers are made up of people we do not know personally.,and
27797_1,It's a shame,Atrocious mistakes in the past limit ethnicities,because
27580_3,The war on terrorism is completely opposite of that.,There are no uniforms.,because
36320_1,I know that I sometimes forget that the people.,I read about in news articles.,and
20519_1,The people of the Afghan village had all three of these qualities.,Im sure there is even more we can learn from them.,and
38221_3,"Bassim showed a specific city during class, too.",Bassim showed the city where he was from.,and
33863_2,It has continually been the same policy.,Each president promises.,and
10377_1,Yes there are acts of racial discrimination.,They seem very trivial and less aggressive than the ones that take place throughout different parts of the United States.,Nan
42068_6,The people had nothing to do with it.,he personally knows and has made friends with many Americans.,because
39002_4,The inhabitants within Iraq are friendly.,The inhabitants within Iraq are normal people.,and
19532_1,Thousands upon thousands have been affected in grave ways,They will continue to be affected.,and
15905_1,We don't have that conflict in the United States.,I have the utmost respect for the Afghans.,so
15466_1,Social media platforms provide information at our fingertips.,I personally believe it's harder for our generation to be blind to the negative realities of the world.,and
38820_2,"I have so much admiration for Bassim because of the level of maturity, positivity, and empathy.",He is able to enlighten us.,Nan
39807_4,We can start by having more empathy., They are just like us too.,and

33174_2,He can actively decide to not feel what is natural.,He can listen to what this book is saying.,and
8566_1,I think that we need to find the middle so that everyone can be comfortable in their own skin.,Everyone can be given the same opportunities as the person next to them. ,and
7679_2,"not only have I not had this problem, I had never even thought about it prior to coming to Penn State.",I grew up in an extremely white neighborhood.,because
35993_1,Christians constantly argue about what is correct.,Christians constantly argue about what Jesus really meant when he said what he said.,and
12212_3,If he had stopped to really look at them he would be able to tell the difference.,I found it very interesting.,Nan
38254_3,I am so thankful that he spoke to the class about his feelings towards what happened.,He is not angry with us,and
35058_3,The government did this to his family. ,He made a positive life out of it.,and
31188_2,I thought the class on Sharia Law was informative.,It is a term that is widely used so often in a negative way.,and
39380_5,"Sam to showed us all of the traditions that these people contain, not the hate.",the violence shown by the groups we associate them with is special.,and
9581_2,Middle school really was painful. , I didnt feel like I was learning anything.,and
26943_2,People should learn more about the force that guides their lives.,They should better themselves with it.,and
11614_1,It is crazy to think that we are the way we are because of time.,That we change according to where we live.,and
31083_1,American people look down on the Muslim practices of divorce.,Muslims think that the men hold all the power.,because
27824_1,"Gay kids can be physically, psychologically tortured by unscientific conversion therapies.",There is no word.,and
31633_1,I want a love where its not perfect,There's no one I'd rather get through life with.,Nan

14818_5,He wants to show different sports using the pictures.,t's not a totally comfortable topic to openly talk about.,and
35940_5,We wouldn't want to kill each other.,We can get that much closer to peace.,and
23276_2,I do not know how I would survive in that country.,It is hard to imagine my life compared to what it is right now.,and
39897_2,I think it was important we were reminded of this. ,We were humbled by listening to a life that is unimaginable to many of the students in that room. ,and
11205_4,They may want to take steps to reduce carbon emissions in the U.S.,if they come to that conclusion.,and
27957_2,people talk to reassure their beliefs,they never see truth outside the chamber,and
40053_3,They are something unique.,They must be protected.,and
38214_2,Our world can sometimes be filled with such hate and crime.,We are simply unwilling to take the time to truly understand other people and their cultures.,because
42229_3,Imagine if it happened to my family.,I do think I could resolve to not be angry at people.,and
12208_1,People are the way they due to natural evolutionary processes.,The processes determine their biologic make up.,because
29275_2,Who is the person hair retains,which moisture used,so
39659_2,The soldiers they were killing were just like them.,They felt empathy for each other.,and
25811_1,People he had never met had invited them into their homes.,They served them tea.,and
36223_2,"Through wold history classes, I am educated enough to realize Christianity has a dark past.","Christianity has had acts of violence, barbaric ways.",and
15991_3,This separates us.,It brings us together.,and
32132_1,I found this interesting.,Most professors at Penn state do not alter their lecture plans from semester to semester.,because
37478_1,We packed up., We left.,so
38301_2,I was so surprised.,He carried himself.,and
35513_2,Everyone grew up differently based on their friends.,Everyone grew up differently based on their school.,Nan
15674_1,"Here, you pointed out how your father has been a football fan since you were born. ","This led you to become one yourself, as culturally, so are most Americans. ",Nan
38858_2,How can people worship the Bible?,How can people take some parts of it so literally?,and
41431_3,It's sometimes hard to fight against our own subconscious biases and misconceptions.,It's necessary to flip the script.,so
19995_1,It is affecting everyday civilians tragically.,Something needs to be done about it.,and
29257_3,"Likewise, I am glad that the Church does not govern the nation.", there are many different beliefs ideologies.,so
33555_4,"educate themselves more on worldly issues, we would not be  nave.", only think about what is happening in the United States.,and
24124_1,I found it really interesting how he kept trying to make it clear that most of his people do NOT hate America., ISIS is just a small group of extreme radicals.,and
8270_1,It opens our minds up even more to the ideology of equality. ,I hope that any close-minded individuals in our class will see through these examples. ,and
39773_4,Our nation easily kills innocent people.,This is something to think about.,and
30017_2,I enjoyed this part of the lecture,it was valuable knowing it is acceptable eventhough some of my actions may be been wrong according to the bible,because
24276_1,This backlash goes to show.,There should be this separation between the religion sector and the schools.,Nan
12814_2,I could have just as easily been born in a different country.,I wasn't.,Nan
25964_2,We dont know how they are different.,We dont know how what goes on changes the course of their everyday lives (Both the Military and Civilians).,Nan
16255_1,They are just fellow human beings.,They live a life doing the same things that we do in the United States.,and
27864_1,I think that we need to remember that the people ,Afghanistan are people just like us they all are just ,and

29592_2,There are a lot of different statements.,They have many opinions.,and
14800_1,I hope this new mentality allows me to expose more people to this thinking.,This will break down common generalizations.,and
26106_1,I really enjoyed this lecture being that I felt like it made me really step back to look at the issue.,I never knew that this was a thing that some people pushed for.,because
29298_2,the actions of radical individuals are no representation of other individuals.,it share their same religion.,and
26509_1,I have an opinion. ,Growing up with a religious background is good.,Nan
15881_1,I thought she was from Cambodia.,It was her darker skin.,because
8992_2,I realized that people around my county may have certain ways of saying things/words that are native to our area.,Because people have been locked into our particular area.,Nan
29752_3," give back to the community, practice kindness, pray often enough."," youre set, whether not you actually follow all the rules outlined by Jesus his disciples.",and
29150_1,I do not expect drastically changed belief imposed from the start by religion,"however, we need to draw a line from being too literal and making judgement off them",Nan
9588_1,I believe that technology is somehow making us more aware and connected.,The almost infinite access to information dissolved all of the boundaries that stopped us from learning.,and
32322_2,"today, people try to use their beliefs to established what is supposed to be right and wrong",it causes conflict between other people with other interpretations of their own beliefs,and
20821_1,I then thought.,How many other innocent people has our government accidentally hurt.,Nan
32876_1,It's all just opinion  with how the bible is written that, (I'm in a bible study class  I know this much) it's all left to people's interpretation.,so
36800_2,Sometimes in life bad things happen to good people.,They are forced to suffer.,and
34372_2,That is the way I was raised.,I have never argued with a person about whether they should believe in divorce.,and
36252_4,I gained respect for this man.,I loved how he was willing to speak to us.,so
13030_3,We should address it.,Put it in the past.,Nan
35071_4,Iraq is going through., but there isnt much more we can do.,Nan
7888_1,It is easy to look at someone.,Put a label on them.,so

42570_5,He is able to acknowledge his sorrow.,but also control it.,Nan
11513_3,Race is talked about too much in the US.,We should just move forward and forget that race is an issue.,Nan
38689_5,"we realize they aren't right , wrong  holding certain beliefs.", they are shaped by their life experiences like ours are.,and
41426_6,I didn't know security wasn't strong.,I didn't know security wasn't abrasive.,so
38918_1,It's a sad thought.,It's a fact.,Nan
11353_1,I thought it was very interesting.,Sam mentioned the breakdown.,Nan
38127_3,It really helped me put my whole life into perspective.,It helped me really focus on the things I value.,and
40036_2,"This discussion in particular, as well as the Sociology 119 class as a whole is what needs to be done",people need to stop being so stereotypical and biased from their cultural perspective.,and
21661_2,I'm Jewish first.,He wouldn't even be in power for us to talk about him.,because
36712_4,"We can do wonders  helping people hold onto hope , forming morals.",I don't believe that it would be a good set of rules to run any full society on.,and
7874_1,It was shocking to look at these images.,It was shocking to realize realize that I actually could not tell the difference.,and
38108_1,War leaves a wound in a place. ,Sometimes the wound can never be healed.,Nan
27975_3,it will create peace,they will be rewarded in the after life,and
42504_1,I definitely agree about something.,I definitely agree about the Soc 119 environment.,Nan
19814_3,He was initially suspicious of their motives.,He had to learn societal norms.,and
21982_2,He said the issue did not pertain to him. ,He said he was uneducated about it.,and
39265_2,Tragedy allowed him to take his knowledge further.,His knowlege into the lives of others increased. ,Nan
10742_1,Yet I had not even thought about the millions of Native Americans that were killed.,Many more displaced from their homes.,and
15162_1,We can't just believe that only happens here.,We can't just think that only happens here.,and
33904_5,exposure to them to see some stories on the news  assume that all Muslims ,are terrorists  extremists  thats all youve seen.,and
22415_3,It is put into practice.,It is not always necessarily an inherently bad thing.,because
33957_1,the idea that the media doesn't show us things.,doesn't truly keep us informed about what is going on in the world.,and
10489_3,Many people don't play hockey.,specifically because of the financial requirements.,and
27320_2,Which has ever lived on this Earth.,Who is free of sin that person is Jesus.,and
36283_1,He says that the few months he was numb.,He didn't fully understand what had happened to him and his family. ,because
14818_4,He wants to show different races using the pictures.,He wants to show different sports using the pictures.,because
24883_1,He came out!,He spoke to us!,and
32922_2,The issue with this is that it plays on the fears of the American people, of the reality of the motivations of involvement of ,because
32466_1,I hear the news about how the United States is involved in a war ," that there are people dedicating they lives to end this war on ISIS,",and
28880_3,It should not be brought to the United States.,It strips away who you are.,because
33998_7,was the fact that the reason that Bassim was able to be  kind  forgiving ,"willing to talk to our class, was  of his faith.",because
40408_1,They call it an accident.,I can't help but think about something like that happening in the US.,Nan
12190_1,This part of the lecture made me think I need to experience the world more.,I need to make my own judgments instead of believing what I am told about people.,and
15211_2,I noticed the different vowels.,I noticed the sounds the were emphasized in accents.,and
33323_1,That may be the case on American soil.,That is not the case for people of different countries.,Nan
14814_2,It's funny to see only black people on the basketball poster.,It's funny to see only white people on the hockey poster.,and
32040_1,That speaks volumes.,"Like most times, the US likes to be involved in other countries.",because
38149_2,We still reap the benefits of American interventionism,It is from the resources they provide,Nan
37851_6,You cannot just teach out of a book when it comes to this class.,because it is contingent on being aware of your surroundings and responding to the stimulus that we face in everyday life.,Nan
7857_8,They have the same feelings like Sam.,as he mentioned in lecture.,and
30975_3,We hear other politicians talk.,Politicians talk about the small populations of Muslims.,and
23342_1,Afghanistan is a country that has known war for almost thirty years.,What do we really know about the war and how its affecting the civilians of Afghanistan?,Nan
39660_4,They had no choice.,The opposing sides spent Christmas together.,because
29915_1,would be hard to make it one most likely not work.,"such a long time, ",and
34803_6, they are not life-changing.,he damage they do to the individual afterward is sometimes irreparable.,and
8315_3, The issue would be about race, the issue would be about your family tree.,Nan
30779_3,It showed me how the other side thinks.,It is able to justify their way of thinking.,and
23912_1,It's also interesting to see how this issue is rarely talked about.,It's interesting how Christians today react to Muslims.,and
36154_5,Having empathy is a good step towards ending discrimination.,putting ourselves in other peoples shoes is a good step towards ending discrimination.,and
8542_3,He uses it as a channel for low ball insults.,He uses it for rants.,Nan
39752_1, Hear how they feel on a day to day basis.,Hearing all the misconceptions about women who wear hijabs.,and
35389_1,The fact that only 17 percent of Christians have a biblical worldview is eye opening.,that just justifies that a majority of Christians are in a sense prioritizing certain parts of the Bible compared to others.,because
38492_2,then he realized that he could not let this define his future.,He realized that he had to move on before it consumed his life.,and
11470_1,I did not realize how much DNA and ancestry had to do with skin pigmentation.,I always thought like you about people.,Nan
41698_5,I wanted to due to the fact that I found this class to be a certain thing.,I found this class to be interesting.,so
34471_1,"I thought his actions are extremely commendable,",I thought his actions are exemplar for us all.,and
21536_3,It can be very traditional.,It includes harsh punishments in order to establish law in our system.,and
15481_1,This is what has pushed race to the forefront of conversation.,This makes our country progressive compared to others. ,and
21850_2,We talk with special guests.,We come to find out that these are real people.,and
21806_1,Death rates for civilians are only increasing.,Sam shows a graph in the clip.,and
12910_2,People can get an understanding of not only other cultures.,People can understanding how to make everyone more equal among societal groups.,so
35390_2,I'd like to learn what Christians believed in.,I'd like to learn which rules they followed.,and
31987_1,"With the man always going along with whoever was in power, it was a very moving story where he had to put his village."," his family their lives anything else, I would not know what decision.",and
8491_6,"Our species is designed to see, analyze differences.", in order to reproduce with what we personally find attractive.,and
37680_1,No matter who you are it takes a special person to come out of losing their family.,not feel anger no matter how long it has been.,and
25862_1,This prejudice needs to change.,Or we will never advance as a society.,Nan
23321_2,His duty as an Afghan is to make countries have different opinions on Afghans.,They are real people.,Nan
22698_1,These books were written thousands of years ago.,They are very cut throat and literal.,so
38214_1,"After his lecture, A Class on Empathy, it made me realize.",Our world can sometimes be filled with such hate and crime.,because
38835_4,we read about the Christian kid who  killed multiple black people at a church.,his beliefs interpreted that there was a need to racial cleansing.,because
42151_1,These kinds of activities are always the most entertaining.,most enlightening lessons that promote deeper thinking in my opinion.,and
20317_1,It would help them successfully complete their service. ,It would help them come back home safely. ,and
38706_4,He knows our governments goal.,Was to protect the citizens and not hurt him.,because
33239_3,I am from Panama.,"In 1989, we suffered a U.S. invasion.",and
15125_1,"Personally, I use my Facebook to put up pictures for family.","Personally, I use my Facebook to look at dog videos.",and
8338_1,I do understand.,I agree with your point.,and
22692_1,I knew it was the main book of Islam.,I knew it was probably similar to the Bible.,and
27707_4, they have to face punishment., limitations they dont have the same beliefs someone else.,because
23132_1,This shows how different each person's interpretation of the Bible can be.,Stereotyping people within a certain religion is so unfair.,and
40852_3,We fail to see how similar they are to Christians.,We fail to see their gruesome history.,and
23826_2,They believe their country is superior so they do not need to learn about other cultures.,Maybe they're just too ignorant to realize they should be aware of other cultures.,and
19739_2,They are the reason why the government needs separation of church and state.,It is why the government has separation of the two.,Nan
23977_1,It helped me realize. ,We are not as different as I had thought originally.,Nan
41887_2,I would hear more about what they had to say.,it was intriguing and semi-sad to see.,and
16211_1,"Yes, part of what they assume might be right.","Ironically, it's irrelevant to the fact that they do not know.",Nan
15529_1,Despite the fact that the US was at war in Afghanistan for most of my life.,I feel that (like most people my age) that I'm not well informed about the Middle East conflict.,Nan
32725_1,They really didnt shy away at all  were very proud of  what ,wearing the Hijab meant to them.,and
32918_1,There are way more news on other countries other than the ones we know about.,There are way more news on other countries other than the ones we care about.,and
33101_3,Americans find it easier than most to make generalizations about Islam..,It's harder for Americans to learn about Islam than to generalize about it.,and
33681_1,He said that he hears many people talking about Muslims killing people.,He never talks about Christians killing people. ,so
20184_1,These people are just like you and me.,They have families and friends.,Nan
23874_1,We are simply attracted to someone.,There's just something about them.,because
22576_1,I am also Christian.,I found it really interesting how closely our beliefs and values really are.,Nan
41811_3,I am very intrigued.,I have not thought of that before.,because
9167_1,We fail to recognize that these countries are extremely wealthy.,They do have impoverished areas.,Nan
20503_1,Resources are available.,Sports have become a culture aspect.,and
11923_3,They found their faith at a young age.,I am not sure what I should believe in.,and
41961_3,he can go back to what used to be his home.,Now it isn't.,and
26671_1,Many people associate Afghanistan with conflict.,It was enlightening to hear the people of Afghanistan are welcoming and kind.  ,so
37055_2,I was amazed at how he could just look past his family’s death. ,We are not responsible for his anger. ,and
15918_3,He wants his daughter away from discrimination.,He wants his daughter away from hate.,Nan
21665_2,They follow Christianity but wish death on soldiers and citizens.,It's not just ISIS out here using religion for hate.,so
36834_4,He moved on from his tragic experience,Anyone can do the same,and
26531_2,I don't think about the way war affects civilians.,People in America don't have direct war in the United States.,because
12603_1,The government that leads this country has traces of racism.,"It allows racism to be a continuous societal flaw, enabling it in certain situations.",and
37719_3,It's time we start to forgive.,It's time to hopefully make a change.,and
37873_1,I thought that was so interesting.,I thought that was strong of him.,and
27554_8,it could diminish hate,it can create solution for bad things faster,so
35000_3, is much farther away.,less prevalent in our society.,and
35301_1,Its easy to just turn against another side.,Empathy is super important.,so
39971_1,I can not even imagine the level of grieve Basim must have had.,losing most of his family to an accidental miscue from a foreign military power.,and
42564_1,Raising awareness or talking about an issue will only spread to a local level.,spread to a state level if youre lucky.,Nan
20374_1,It assists in being able to work together effectively.,It keeps everyone safe.,and
27113_1,Dialogue allow us to sympathize with them,They hope and pray for a better future,Nan
36279_4,I can see myself becoming more open-minded,I can see myself becoming humble to every kind of culture.,and
34509_2,I would at first be numb and then angry.,I still don't think I would have enough strength.,Nan
38655_1,I thought for the longest time that all the people from those countries are militant,I thought for the longest time that all the people from those countries are radical.,and
41705_1,Basim did not blame Americans.,Basim blamed the American government.,Nan
34348_3,Bassim can forgive the United States.,destroying his house.,and
33369_1,I agree with what you are saying.,Someone has different beliefs or views from ours.,because
28551_1,People think that militaries are sent to foreign countries to kill enemies.,It's much more than that.,so
20092_1,He had a beautiful wife.,He had a daughter.,Nan
39018_1,I am fortunate.,I am fortunate to have had that opportunity,Nan
41059_2,We have to let it go.,We do nothing withholding all of the anger within us.,and
32065_3,Basim was knowing less about politics. ,Basim was just living a normal life. ,and
33635_4,everything due to the bombing.,raids that happen on their home front..,and
19617_1,Lieutenant Colonel Garey mentioned in his talk was that he was an adviser., I think what he mentioned comes down to the role of United States has in Afghanistan.,and
32060_4,Bassim said that he began to forgive.,Bassim said angry was eating his up,because
35529_5,There is separation of Muslims in the US through the media.,There is alienation of Muslims in the US through popular stereotypes.,and
34150_1,We heard many times.,You don't care.,because
16175_1,The topic that resonated with me was War Affects Real People.,Most people are so unknowingly oblivious to what Afghanistan really is.,and
10321_1,"Your post really reminded me to recognize the soft skills, mindsets, and competence.",I have other areas that I bring to the table.,Nan
30615_2,Everyone decides individually the extent they will follow it.,Everyone decides the way they will interpret it.,and
11050_1,Many different ethnic backgrounds surround me at State College.,Countless different qualities make up these people.,and
36109_1,He realized being angry was going to affect him in the long run.,It was going to eat him alive.,because
20799_1,Its truly scary.,It's horrifying to think about.,and
20394_1,Soc119 opens my eyes.,It gives me a fresh perspective on the world.,Nan
23307_1,It affects how they talk about cultures too.,It is due to the fact that they are uneducated on the subject.,because
32285_4,I am familiar with Saudi culture due to a prior Penn State film class.,We read/watched films that had to do with something.,because
30962_8,"Racism, discrimination, and inequality are real today. ",These issues should not be ignored. ,Nan
21492_4,Couples date.,They are attracted to each other physically.,because
31936_2, I would love to learn more about.,hear different peoples opinions on.,and
35354_1,I completely agree with your statement that Basim doesn't generalize all Americans.,Why should we generalize him.,so
40479_4,To an accidental bombing.,Showed much compassion talking about us U.S. citizens.,and
15572_2,There are many many paths.,You just have to find yours.,Nan
35569_2,"Having family, aspirations.",All was quickly taken away with the accidental bombing.,and
13602_4,We don't have westernized names.,Pretty much all Koreans and Chinese students at Penn States have a westernized name along with their original name. ,Nan
30134_1,It really is quite beautiful., it is not very long.,and
36297_2,it shows that in their value system the connection with a friend is important than the gift itself,"This I can say is definitely not the case in the States, that speaks volumes.",and
39496_1,I feel hatred towards our government for doing this to Basim.,For doing this to his family.,and
40259_2,There was not a lot of difference in the presidencies in the USA between 2003-current.,There was no change from Bush-Trump.,and
23063_1,It is so important that people understand that just because we are at war with a country does not mean that every single person in that country agrees with that war.,Just because we are at war with a country does not mean that every single person in that country agrees with that war or is involved with the war in some way or another.,Nan
29534_1,it is hard convincing people looking into different culture any more than mainstream media stories,when people begin to do that looking at afghan people as actual people,and
42718_1,He said that it is his religion.,He is Muslim.,because
40449_1,It astonishes me that he has the fortitude to continue to live his life the way he does.,if I were in his position I do not think I would be able to be as calm as he is.,because
21795_2,He would lay awake at night unable to comprehend the horror he saw.,He could hear numerous men crying softly in their bunks.,Nan
29902_1,There is many reasons behind why people in the country ," that get a divorce,  it all makes sense, that  there is ",and
40749_2, We live in this Christian land.,It is difficult for us to see things objectively.,because
35315_3,He knew that is not what American culture is.,He is able to think past one or two tragic events.,so
41529_4,War affects the other countries.,and civilians.,Nan
36364_2,It was interesting how Bassim sees nothing wrong with the American people.,Many of us helped him in his time of need. ,because
39801_4,the regular person cannot get an education nor health benefits,that wages and pensions are being reduced.,and
23591_2,They introduce themselves as a person.,We put a label at them.,Nan
37750_1,Classes like Soc 119 allow a spark of this trait to grow with one's character.,Classes like Soc 119 allow a spark of this trait to evolve with one's character.,and
42023_1,Here's why I feel that we do this.,We are uncomfortable.,because
21801_4,He is a kind person., and a father.,and
14078_1,My brother loved basketball.,That's what he put all his focus in.,and
10384_1,It is insane to think about not even knowing how many native american tribes are present in the US.,How that information is never presented to us in high school.,and
26279_1,Dr. Richards' lecture brought up a difficult question.,How do you rectify the hypocrisy of these documents?,Nan
36483_3,I commented on the video.,It was just before this one where Sam shared Basim's story.,and
35755_3,Some people associate Islam with dangerous actions.,Some individuals that follow it adopt the prechings.,because
35974_7,It is something unique.,I don't think many people could do this.,Nan
15223_1, America can ignore the fact that people have different skin colors totally. ,Meaning there will be no discrimination or prejudice to different races. ,Nan
19226_3,We need to look at how each race is unique.,We need to see how beautiful their cultures are.,and
26641_2,I do not put myself in their shoes,do they exist to me,and
11734_2,We need to combat white supremacy.,We need to speak more about it to come to terms.,and
39956_2,"Despite the ambiguity, this year's classes led me to ask questions.",I learned many things this year.,and
41363_2,She explains Muslims as very forgiving. ,She provides examples of how the Quran supports that.,and
26973_6,Its a shame I wonder what the outcome would be.,How far a society we would have become.,because
29602_4,Doing this allows the citizens of the foreign country to build up trust with the Americans.,Doing this allows the citizens of the foreign country to learn that Americans are there to help them.,and
41730_2,A man who wants to cut taxes for the rich.,A man who uses Twitter as his main form of communication with the entire country.,and
38544_2,How much love Bassam has for Americans.,When he has everything in the world to hold against us.,Nan
25013_1,They are putting their lives on the line.,They are not just another statistic.,and
26122_1,There are constant allegations of President Obama being Muslim.,They are a clear example of Islam being unacceptable in a civic leader.,Nan
39179_1,I personally found the response to the tragedy very moving. ,"There was no response with aggression,nor hatred, during this horrible incident.",and
42728_1,I feel like Basim talked about how his religion teaches him to forgive.,that is what helped him to forgive us.,and
29022_5,people would be more understand and rely less on war,war is a tragedy,because
36572_3,Everyone should use it in their everyday lives.,We start to learn how to let go of anger.,because
20495_2,They choose to live their lives in very different ways.,They understand the religion in very different ways.,so
41768_3,I always wanted a class where we could sit back. ,I always wanted a class where we could take in the information. ,and
12482_1,The scientific mindset of the 17th century is still living and thriving today.,It has allowed for atrocious groups like Richard Spencer's to exist.,and
27200_3,we can better understand the situation there,we can treat other fleeing muslim with more respect,and
20424_1,I just think about images.,I have seen on the news.,so
35052_4,They sounded great on paper. ,but were completely dumps.,Nan
25449_3,Christianity is a religion that preaches peace.,Groups built on hate could not be Christians.,Nan
30808_4, hear people from the actual country we understand that people are put at risk, every single day- innocent people that don't want anything to do with hate violence.,and
31503_1,People think their actions are right.,It is hard to know what is right.,so
16387_1,He talked of people realizing the reality of people around the world.,This helped them essentially not to judge them.,and
39937_2,We got to speak to men from both of these countries.,"We got to learn more about the culture, history, and current political problems.",and
30390_2,Their goal is to distract the general population from the serious political issues on the table.,This makes people overlook injustices the government may be perpetrating on its citizens.,Nan
31614_1,I agree with you that government should be separate from religion.,I disagree with your point that using the bible as a daily guide of life can be harmful.,so
31989_2,It is almost ironic.,Many Americans scrutinize against and are afraid of Sharia Law.,Nan
40466_1,Hearing Basim's story is something I will never forget.,I think that I will be a better person because of it.,and
9145_2,It was only natural she didn't understand everything going on in the U.S.,She had been here only two years.,because
41658_3,he could differentiate that the problem was not from the general Americans., he could differentiate that the problem was from the government.,because
35423_2,He said he did not blame Americans.,All he had seen from us was kindness.,because
9494_2,"I don't want to offend anyone when it comes to race, politics, or privilege.","Often times, I avoid the subject.",so
13153_3,It is our story.,I think this is the way everyone should think.,and
29902_6," that get a divorce,  it all makes sense, that  there is ", many reason people may not want to be  anymore.,because
41847_1,It was interesting to hear from someone who actually lives in Iraq.,It was interesting to see their point of view on it.,and
40954_3,Religion is complex.,How can it be interpreted similarly. ,so
33938_8,We could never imagine a random bomb dropping on our house.,We could never imagine a random bomb killing our loved ones. ,because
27630_3,it was nice that a white professor to be able to talk about the issue of radicalism in many faiths.,it make the connection that those kkk members are no more american.,and
14824_1,It can be directed towards your social class.,It can be directed toward the climate you live in.,and
29400_1,It's interesting to think about how American soldiers., are actually interacting with civilians from different countries making sure they are safe at the same time.,and
21490_1,LTC Garey could get away with it.,He had the rank and pull to do that sort of thing.,because
36367_5,they tried to give him money in return for him losing many members of his family,I just thought like wow the USA is actually trying to repay this guy for killing his family with a small amount of money,and
41420_1,He had actually lived here.,He made friends with Americans.,and
11000_1,"I think that the American education system likes to heavily sugar coat topics for young students,",I believe that hurts the students as they are being taught very vague historical content.,Nan
39668_2,Basim was able to avoid irrational hatred toward the American people for crimes their government committed.,Others aren't able to forgive very easily.,and
36051_1,Sam explains that we have been focusing on Islam.,He feels that it is a relevant topic.,because
24436_1,I've made a lot of  wrong decisions in life.,Idon't know if I'll make it to purgatory. ,so
41917_1,I decided to respond to the video.,How are Things in Mosul Today?.,Nan
30697_2,where we are a society today.,the most people our age have never partaken in that kind of racist behavior themselves,because
11704_2,We can quickly generalize all members of the Alt-Right to be filled with hate.,We can say that they hate anyone who isn't white.,Nan
35255_5,It would be considered bizarre by Americans.,"To Muslims, that is considered a wrong act.",and
39282_1,Sam started talking about the numbers.,Sam started showing the class about today's numbers.,and
39793_4,You learn these people have lives with real value.,How they are affected matters much more to people everywhere.,and
21801_2,He works hard.,He is a kind person.,and
42052_4,his friends have treated him well.,his friends made him see we can be good people.,because
22192_2,A modification needs to be made.,Everyone has to work to attain peace.,and
27227_1,The Bible was written extremely long ago.,Our society has matured.,and
11451_1,"If I remember correctly, this discussion began with the talks of white supremacists.","It was regarding their recent actions in Charlotsville, Virginia.",and
26201_1,America has hundreds of different religions.,We will never operate under a singular religious Sharia law.,and
37585_1,The Constitution states government shall be separate from religion.,aren't these conservative beliefs propagating Christian Sharia?,so
19074_1,We were able to look at a war-torn country.,We saw a shopping mall completely similar to ours.,Nan
19390_4,Protection doesn't have to include killing.,or destroying the lives of innocent people.,and
24533_1,Human beings are being killed over a dispute.,This has been going on 10+ years.,and
31826_1,I feel like many people are quick to jump to conclusions.,We often forget that cities like Mosul have real people just like us.,so
39110_2,He’s such an insightful person. ,Iraqis reached out to him to say what he talked about was spot on.,and
36069_2, allow eyes to be open.,to see that we are not different.,and
41850_4,t Iraq is just a war zone,all the citizens are at war.,and
24969_1,They showed them they were safe.,They are protected to vote.,and
41405_3,Everyone should have the right to. ,Everyone should not feel judged in the country that they live in.,and
33117_1,He went on to show what Mosul was like.,what his house plus family were like.,and
42691_5,It made me realize how ignorant it is that we don't explore other cultures.,We are all the same same and have familes and jobs.,because
30966_2,I have found myself yet again feeling guilty for not understanding how ignorant and rude so many white people are.,I wonder why this is a problem that has yet to go away.,and
33904_1," it comes to Muslims, it is very easy,  youve had little to no ",exposure to them to see some stories on the news  assume that all Muslims ,and
26784_1,I completely agree with everything you said.,I also agree with what Sam said. ,Nan
14404_1,People associate talking properly with being white.,People associate talking ghetto as being black.,and
38014_4,"people should notice that love ,peace can be a favorable advantage over hate","people should notice that love , peace can be a favorable advantage over violence",and
41850_5,t Iraq is just a war zone,all the citizens are at war.,and
19341_1,"Yes, this explicitly goes against our constitution.",Our constitution separates church and state.,and
30232_3, discriminate against the LGBT community., the Bible says that's wrong.,because
33612_2,everything can change in just one day.,We need to live everyday like it is our last.,so
32864_3,"religion to each other  it allowed me to have a different, more open-minded", perspective of these religions  how we treat them.,and
30447_2,They are humans.,They are like us.,Nan
24826_1,Look at the entire Sharia law with both religions.,"It tends to lead people to harsh, strict ways of worship.",and
39875_5,He clarified that the reason the class is focused  on Islam right now., the class is focus is a ridiculous amount of Islamophobia.,and
41106_3,Is being challenged.,I feel the same way.,because
42184_2,Basim said he doesnt want to be governed by Islam.,He wants a civilian government.,and
15890_4,The separation between whites and Mexicans is clear.,They can look at each other.,Nan
30168_1,I like how you relate your experience living  interacting with those, in the Middle East what Rafi was speaking about in class.,and
27099_1,Religion should be within each peoples heart.,Religion should be within each peoples life.,and
12184_2,"He said we, as Americans, still have this idea that all of Africa is poor.",There has been that stigma for a while.,because
38026_4,A person thinks we need to be more aware about something.,of the world we live in.,and
32676_1,I agree.,Trying to have religion be the basis for laws is not productive or effective.,and
41682_1,I consider myself to be biased.,I am a special needs person.,because
19251_1,You can learn about many different types of culture.,It's a complete mind changing experience.,and
26127_5,"In the home, people are not usually ever encouraged to pursue other religions.",just to accept what your parents gave to you or alternatively to abandon the religion.,because
20926_1,We dehumanize it.,We do not really think about the actual lives that it effects.,and
11401_1, They are all wealthy is the reason why.,They wouldn't be caught dead serving tables at a restaurant.,because
35069_2,It took away women's rights,Abolished influence of western culture,and
8490_1,A lot of the girls I have dated have had many similarities with my mother.,They have had similarities with my sister too.,and
29023_4,"These people view their religion a certain way, too.",as the superior group.,and
22312_1,The Taliban member was willing to get in such close quarters.,He was willing to talk to the enemy and trying to find them.,Nan
35324_1,I was born catholic.,I do not consider myself a very religious person.,and
10505_1,It is something that makes them different from everybody else.,"Often times, they are proud of that.",and
32949_1,"We, as Americans, cannot generalize people of a different country.","For all we know, we are the same as them.",because
39993_1,Sam had a discussion during class.,Sam made points during class.,and
36048_1,The instructor is willing to be free.,His teaching techniques has many advantages.,and
30512_3,It allowed me to remember everything I learned over the past few years.,It allowed me to reflect on everything I learned over the past few years.,and
41657_6,"They asked does he feel angry, the feeling is that it would take a long time to get over this event.","No matter what he stayed calm, peaceful through it all. ",and
34485_2,I think we base are believes on stereotypes no one ever talks about how generous these people are all they talk about is war ., more war.,and
22766_2,I think it would be challenging for me to continue to have hope for the future.,It would be hard to live with a positive outlook.,and
42508_1,This class is doing literally just that in front of me every Tuesday.,I can already say that 6 weeks .,and
40352_1,China engaged in war with Russia and Japan often.,Would you have guessed more people died?,and
34496_1,"At Penn State though, I have had multiple interactions with Indian people.",It has definitely been an influential part of my life.,and
13870_2,I knew people had distinct features based on where they are from.,I never realized that larger noses are more normal.,Nan
27256_1,People follow a religion.,People don't follow a religion.,and
26300_1,I just thought about how some people with similar aspirations to my own would be unable to fulfill them.,They may be caught up in a war that they do not even want.,because
20088_2,I was actually able to appreciate what these men and women were doing every day.,This was in order to fight for our country.,Nan
26405_1,LTC Garey later found out that the guy was not talking.,There were enemies in the village.,because
15298_1,We need to come to terms that this is a racist country.,We need to eradicate this dllemma to keep it from eradicating us.,and
39217_1,I can connect to this.,My friends were affected by a major flooding.,because
38330_1,He does this in hope that we might help others who have experienced loss,He does this to have people be more aware that there are great people like him in Iraq.,and
32242_2,They freely choose to wear their hijab.,They like it.,and
28685_3,Now it's different.,She's in a different position.,because
9513_6,The video talks about racial inequality in Colombia., and how a lot white people in those countries have power.,and
21065_1,The media portrays Africa as poor.,We see images.,and
19979_1,Being a civilian from Afghanistan.,Rafi provided tremendous insight on his life and perceptions in and out of Afghanistan.,Nan
34595_3,No one is near.,Would it be stealing to pocket it?,and
32094_1,I'm not aware.,I'm not close to being aware of all that happens with ISIS.,and
33781_5,it really made me think about how people see things differently.,depending on where theyre from how theyre raised.,and
34816_4,not being a big deal.,everyone is Islam.,because
42691_1,I'm glad he brought this to my attention.,It made me realize how easy it is to explore other cultures.,because
22133_2,Rafi's partner was murdered.,"Amazingly, they have positive attitudes.",and
34162_1,The Bible provides a basis on which people should go about living their lives.,Quran provides a basis on which people should go about living their lives.,and
41422_1,Bassim was able to acknowledge not all Americans are bad.,It was not them who killed his family.,and
14397_4,He is only being able to jump that high.,and nobody realizes it.,because
36034_1, I believe business owners should have the right to decide.,I believe religious figures should have the right to decide.,and
19121_1,I slowly realized how did racial problems impact on the modern society.,I went to high school which is diverse.,and
29285_2,It made me feel very uncultured,it made me feel ignorant about what is really going on around us in the world,and
12463_1,There is only one person that has ever guessed where I was from.,I was really impressed.,and
12162_1,People from different areas of the world come to America.,They probably think all Americans look the same.,and
41882_2,They were understaning.,They said that behind closed doors.,and
40104_3,the fact that Sam brought up empathy and the importance of it I think was extremely relevant to the course.,I think it was extremely relevant to our lives in general.,and
9233_1,I didn't even realize it until I came back to State College.,People would laugh at me every time I used the word.,and
34511_2,I went back to my dorm room,I watched all of the videos on Youtube that I could find of Basim Razzo from previous semesters of Soc 119,and
11068_1,Dr. Richards frequently calls out people with particular physical features.,He says why they have them specifically.,and
27087_2,These people are just like me.,I think it's important to fix this misconception.,and
15863_1,He tells stories of meeting all of these people who are nothing like me.,He tells stories of young kids who are so much smarter than we are.,Nan
42497_3,today my very best friends are Jewish,my boyfriend is Jewish.,and
15626_3,I do not agree.,It is something that can not be solved.,Nan
27053_1,We enjoy taking strong sides on things.,We enjoy demonizing the other side.,and
14223_1,We take the easy way out.,We don't discuss it.,and
39283_5,"think about real history, remember that whites actually made 650,000 on average household","blacks made under 100,000.",and
36487_1,Your second paragraph made really strong points about pre-judging people.,We really don't know.,Nan
26778_1,I agree with your idea.,It's not about body structure with race.,Nan
38258_2,Sam pointed out how most religious teachings are essentially the same.,This applied to what Bassim was saying.,and
32888_1,This advice from Bassim was powerful and simple.,It can be taken up by us in Soc119.,and
34875_1,I think this is the reason that this question was asked last year.,I'm not the only one that thinks like that.,because
40127_1,Our land is predominantly Christian.,"We are biased, lacking objectivity in our views.",so
37479_2,One of my friends had to stay home from school that day.,It just happened to be her dad's turn to miss work.,and
35655_2,Utilizing this understanding to create laws.,Everyone must follow is authoritarian at best.,and
21065_2,We see images.,The images aren't always the full picture.,and
42375_1,Learning from hearing others personal experiences.,learning from reading a textbook are two very different methods.,and
42498_2,I attended tons of Bar Mitzvah temple services.,I attended tons of Bat Mitzvah temple services.,and
33675_4,Islam led Basim to this realization of forgiveness.,Forgiveness to relieve inner anger.,and
29645_1,Hearing about Rafi  LTC Garey's firsthand experiences is really invaluable to us, it helps us to become more culturally aware.,and
23588_1,We have goals in life.,We would like make this country better in any way.,and
41442_1,It is a shame social media has so much potential.,It can bring together the society in which we live in today.,because
30952_1,You cannot make the nation one religion.,Our nation is multiple religions.,because
19951_3,"I'd just like to focus my thoughts and understanding on how the war, and our presence in other countries is affecting the well being of people who live in those countries.","I'd like to focus on people who just want to live like us; safely, happily, etc.",because
8473_1,Your response was very good.,It made me think a lot.,and
21274_2,It can be easy to dehumanize the issues.,It can be easy to dehumanize the people involved.,so
40717_7,He holds no hate in his heart. ,but instead be forgiving.,and
35038_1,The points you make about this video are very good ones., I agree with what you are saying.,and
27135_3,which will read take away only what they want from the teachings.,Which extreme views Sharia Law comes from,and
35561_2,It's necessary to flip the script.,Put yourself at the other end of the discussion. ,and
40670_2,They disgraced me.,They took the lives of my loved ones.,and
33533_2,Things like this have become normalized in a country.,The country is a war zone.,because
21513_1,I was very intrigued by the fact that so many countries could go to war with each other.,I was very intrigued how so much life could be lost so quickly.,and
12481_2,Black people were physically and mentally lesser.,They held onto their hatred and way of looking down upon previously enslaved.,so
30079_1, it was always in the back of my mind.,"actually sitting, listening, engaging with the fact",and
40488_3,The Civil War was a way to free the slaves.,World War II was the U.S. saving Europe from destruction. ,and

39324_3,"The American military has done harm to his life, along with to his family.",He has to keep moving on in attempt to move past the tragedy. ,and
32641_2,Islamophobia in this country is real.,It's because a lot of people have never met someone of the Muslim faith.,so
34801_1,ne must entertain the thought that this world  we know may have had the potential to be a much safer.,"A peaceful place had we taken the time , energy to learn and understand others.",and
25638_1,"However, I cannot imagine how life is for people who are learning religion in their school too.",I believe the two do not mix at all.,because
39523_3,"Pointed out by Sam, it would be easier on us to dismiss radical Christians,  calling them not real christians.","A Christian based society that we live in today, gives us a well established idea of how a Christian should act, society tells us what it is.",because

29068_1,I did not answer,she knew little that these girls sin just as much as I do on the weekends,because
30013_3,people are fixated on gay rightsand how you can l be religious., I feel some people forget they've had haircuts,so

34474_3,This is the reason they are not going out to discover the real Afghanistan., what the government does is simply there to protect us.,and
29055_1,If people take themselves out of their shoes as we have never been through what they have been through,they would be more understanding and rely less on war due to its tragedy,because
28795_2,Being under constant threat would keep people from sleeping at night.,"Living with soldiers from another country on their doorstep every day would create some frustration, if not anger, after a while.",and
25402_1,These people like Trump are saying things like every Muslim wants to come into the United States,Every Muslim wants to impose Sharia law on all of us.,and
38945_1,This was surprising to me.,I honestly never knew how they felt.,because

31230_1,What Sam said was interesting.,His talk about role reversals was powerful.,and
35704_1,There can be many interpretations.,It is not wise to base the law system off of just one.,so
42405_1,I learned much in these first few weeks of class.,I never would have thought of before.,so
33250_1,I believe it is t he root for a lot of conflict,As Sam mentioned in class.,because
34419_2,He says that he eventually became angry.,This is how I would expect most people to respond to a travesty like what had happened to him.,and
38403_4,We can even go down to one of these effected areas.,We can volunteer.,and
33326_1,Basam has said that about many administrations.,promised to help with issues that his community faces.,Nan

15456_2,They either say something that comes out the wrong way. ,They do not speak about it. ,so

36237_1,This is absolutely due to living in a christian society.,It is easier to see them but not us.,because
34823_1,people should analyze how Christians are treated.,"Christians should be discussed compared to other religions,like  Muslims.",and
35518_2,Think in the perspective of someone different from us.,We will discover how wrong some of the extremism are.,Nan
36576_1,"Next, I was also very surprised by the tea story. ",It is crazy that the Sargent was talking to the person he was searching for for a long time. ,because

34325_1,I am sure that they want to get rid of ISIS.,As much as the Americans.,Nan
8539_1,I don't think it's negative enough to ban the use of phones during class.,The good of students communicating with each other at all outweighs the bad.,because
32988_4,We have more ways of receiving information.,We have more than any of the generations.,and
19687_1,The war has great people like himself suffering.,It has people that welcomed LTC Garey warmly suffering.,and

30840_1,The people that the war actually impacts are not just a made-up conspiracy.,They are real.,and
37605_2,A whole generation will potentially be devastated.,A domino effect of actions have taken place in the middle east over the past 15 years.,Nan
42358_2,I love to try new things.,I want to travel the world and see everything.,Nan
8699_1,Dr. Richards first responded to the student.,Two other students in the class gave their opinions/responses.,and

36289_2,To see him willing to forgive us is truly inspirational.,To see him even say that he loves America is truly inspirational.,and
42072_1,I personally thought.,Many women were just forced to wear hijabs.,Nan
31197_1,It makes sense that people have  many opinions on, what it means to be a good Muslim  run a country based on the book.,so
10777_2,The politician had an idea of what might happen if he corrected her.,He is not actually a Muslim.,Nan
33957_3,doesn't truly keep us informed about what is going on in the world.,it just shows us what will get it better  higher ratings.,and
40675_1,Bassim's story gave me a new point of view.,I approached the anger built up inside.,and
33642_6,They are motivations that encourage him to move forward.,He serves the best for the country that he's been living in more than thirty years. ,because
11914_1,We need to stop comparing ourselves to others who are doing worse than us.,We need to start comparing ourselves to those countries that are doing better than us.,and
42155_1,It was incredibly sad to head that story.,It was said to hear his views on everything.,and
36155_2,we all want to understand other cultures other than our own.,this lecture showed us how to begin doing that.,and

25206_2,It affects every feeling they have.,It affects every decision they make on a day to day basis.,and
26799_4,remember that there are people like us,not from American do not make people less human,because
32916_1,we understand more about the countries,learn about their culture,and
36012_2,This is the country that we proudly talk about.,"the country was  responsible  to an act that is unforgivable , shameful.",and
13575_1,One day ski passes can be hundreds of dollars.,Limited locations often requires a lot of travel time.,and
31708_2,Effects of Isis,Effects of the US.,and
40129_3,We were to just take a step back.,We would see the world in a completely different way.,and
32320_1,It goes back to people reading their sharia.,People interpret it the way that they want to. ,and
29406_4,which through all of his pain sadness,the government did this to his family individual american citizens,and
29676_3, it is preposterous crazy., it can be interpreted is many ways by so many people.,because
33026_2,I think a lot of students don't realize how unfair it is to only label Muslims as bad people.,Christians commit some heinous crimes in the name of God.,because
26616_1,The Bible says something.,The Quran says something.,because
10378_1,"In the United States, hate crimes are very common.",Police brutality is a very recurrent (but also avoided) topic.,and
32506_1,"He lived in Mosul with his wife, daughter.", his brother's family lived there in a different house.,and

30289_4,"on the country, I always thought that Afghanistan was a war-torn country,that", rife with poverty  famine  full of people who are  much different than we are.,so

8926_1,I've never considered the thought of dating outside of my race., It wasn't something that happened where I'm from.,because
42720_1,It is crazy to me.,There are so many people who generalize Muslims.,and
24519_3,It was refreshing to hear his take on how they are different.,The things they say are not that different.,and
31359_4,I have never been able to break that barrier in front of 500 people.,"This class has given me the confidence to break that barrier, outside of class.",and
30715_2,"In Ohio State if the same situation occrued, the wife must wait 7 years.",We all have created a fake sense that things are going backwards in this country.,because
24310_1,We think of the worst of everyone.,It takes a long time before we  lift the judgment off of them.,and
7952_2,Some people feel that this allows them to say certain things.,They wouldn't feel comfortable saying in front of many people.,Nan
14522_1,It shows what Penn State stands for.,We do not agree with such ideas.,and
14579_1,In basketball all you need is a ball and a hoop.,In hockey you need all the equipment.,and

35315_2,He knew that is not what American culture is.,He is able to think past one or two tragic events.,because
10950_1,It can sometimes be overlooked.,It's because of how sensitive the topic can be.,Nan
23179_4,"after hearing Sam and Rafi talk about them, I have changed my mind set.",I will now be able to identify with them.,Nan
38444_6,rest of the world thought the same way.,"we may one day live in a more forgiving , loving place.",and
11653_3,Someone hails from Haiti.,One could be superior to the other intellectually.,because
20830_1,You said that you found it interesting that American are physically similar to Asians.,Americans and Asians differ in traditions.,Nan
10290_2,The media stereotypes drug use.,They stereotype it to a certain race.,Nan
39428_1,We have to understand that not everything is the way it seems.,Not everybody is exactly the same as the people from their same religion.,and
30956_3,Now I understand how seriously some Muslimes take their religion. ,They do have precise times they must pray. ,and
14954_1,Raising awareness allows people to be educated on the issues.,This helps the implementation of programs to help those in need.,and
19746_1,Koran helps them understand their lives.,Koran helps them understand what were doing here.,and

33169_1,"When something happens that we don't like, we turn to hateful comments.",We turn to degrading others with our words.,and

19256_1,Learn more about it.,Your whole perspective on life can literally change.,and
38448_2,There are people who are very rich.,There are people who have great education.,and
19497_1,We never hear about these incidents.,American media doesn't cover it.,because
32011_3,"They killed his wife, daughter, extended family.",The sense of guilt I felt was overwhelming.,and
29079_6, most importantly what we are doing to our world., the media does not show us the realities of America.,because
21862_4,They are trying to make it by with their pride.,and to minimize war and external problems.,and
8491_3,I do agree that everyone sees differences in people.,"Our species is designed to see, analyze differences.",and
19811_1,I think most of life's purpose comes from trying to do right by others.,Rafi does a tremendous job of this.,and
12172_1,55 being muslims.,73 being jews.,and
42275_2,"After they explained why they wear it, I completely understood why. ",It made sense to me. ,and
42131_1,It should be even scarier for us as Americans.,We aren't so far from that reality ourselves.,Nan
26655_3,It is most likely.,The high school is in a town.,because
27757_5,I thought the Quran encourages violence.,That's why many Islamic-based terrorist groups exist.,so
27410_3, meet people like Mr. Rafi that you realize .,Afghanistan is just like any other country.,and
40830_4,I would handle the situation with such grace.,I would handle the situation with determination.,and
27665_1,The Bible is open to be interpreted in many different ways.,It is up to the person reading it to view it how they wish.,and
42233_3,His response stuck with me since this lecture.,I strongly agree.,because
37855_1,We need to have arguments.,We need to be tested.,and
29083_2,People should definitely have a certain right.,People should have the right to choose which religion they want to follow.,and
19462_1,I think this is a lot of the reason why many people in the United States have this opinion.,The media here portrays the Afghan people in a bad light.,because
30324_4,We must be aware citizens.,"Always question authority, religious or political.",and
31809_1,Most people automatically assume Muslims are violent people due to ISIS.,ISIS is a hate group who are Muslim.,because
41355_1,If you were to talk to someone in the military who has spent a substantial amount of time over in these areas.,Youd get a much better view of how the vast majority of people over there are just the same as us.,Nan
21085_1,You say your Hail Marys.,You are forgiven on your sins.,and
20459_1,They are people just like us., I bet that they are better human beings than what we are.,and
42385_1, I love this class.,It teaches us to dig deeper beyond what is at the surface.,because

36270_1,I don't think it falls under a certain religion.,I do believe that there is someone out there that watches over us.,Nan

22770_1,I know that my parents look at Muslims differently.,"That reflected onto my life to look at them differently, too.",so
39177_1,Bassim states anger is useless.,The anger would eat away at him.,because
41187_7,This interaction is key to getting Americans to better understand. ,"Iraqi, to come the same realization.",and
36225_1,It shows that there is a problem with our society.,There is a problem with our government.,and
27752_3,It is only a small group of Muslims.,A small group of Muslims have been radicalized.,and
40250_1,He stays very strong in his faith. ,"Despite everything that happened to him in the past, he stays strong. ",so

27694_2,I grew up in a simple life.,I believe that helped shape me into the person I am today.,and
39599_1,I have been thinking about this class.,I have been thinking about this conversation almost two week,and
39768_1,I do not think many people can really relate to how he feels with his life.,What has happened was truly a tragedy.,because
8747_1,I do think racism is still around this nation.,It is constantly a problem for many people.,and
36327_4,Our ability to hear is given freely.,Our family is given freely.,and
15377_3,It's hard to get around the topic.,People shouldn't shame themselves for having opinions on a topic.,so
37837_1,"One of the questions that was asked was, How are you not angrier with us (America)?",How do you live every day without being angry all the time?,and
29619_1,who doesn't takes sides ,who is a fairmediator it really helps trying to form,and
23406_1,We live in a free country.,They didn't like our democracy.,because
37771_3,why they would keep trying to hurt South Korea?,they would keep trying to hurt  other countries.,and
36624_1,A lot of the time the news shows only the bad parts of the Middle East.,The news makes everyday Americans ignorant to what life is really like.,Nan
16258_1,It is that all Afghans want to be at war.,It's that they do not want peace.,and
24459_1,He does a great job talking about specific interactions he had with all sorts of Afghani people.,They live lives just like us.,and
36768_1,It is a mind-blowing idea.,We can truly see then how the way we view other countries might be the same as how they view our country.,because
30202_2,who think this is interesting ,which it is similar to what he has spoke about in past lessons,because
41828_1,"He was never involved in anything negative, his life was destroyed anyway.",His life got destroyed in the matter of one day.,and
11158_1,It was based off of what clothes they were wearing.,It was also if their teeth were straight.,and
31725_3,"They proclaim that God hates Muslims, Gays and Jews",we say the excuse that they are not real Christians,and
38908_1,This talk gave me chills.,I still think about Basims quote.,and
30092_6,"They are intolerant of other faiths, they pray 5 times a day at a precise time. ","In Jordan, Lebanon they were more lenient but in Kuwait they actually would often pray 5 times a day.",and
13175_1,"I learned I am nearly 54% German, 32% Italian, 4% Ukrainian.",Several other places across Europe make the remaining 10%.,and
21314_1,Most people who create these assumptions know nothing about the culture.,They have made these conclusions on their own or through what they hear.,and
14147_1,Minorities rarely see their experiences portrayed in media.,Minorities see them portrayed accurately even less often.,and
14679_1,"Overall, this was a well-written response.",This was an interesting response. ,Nan
8528_1,I definitely agree with that statement.,We do not pay enough.,Nan
30986_1,This is discrimination towards women.,They are not receiving equal power.,because
35972_1,We have become a society that is unforgiving.,We have become a society that is constantly angry at others.,and
20585_2,People are not even aware of the cause of this war.,The global interests involved in it.,and
32828_2,He experienced anger.,It was unheard of to me.,and
34460_5,to whatever is left of my family.,what would allow me to have much strength forgiving America.,and
37792_1,It is a crazy thing to think about Bassim's story.,It has to be similar to many other people's.,so
42608_1,"people think about Sharia, they often time think , associate it with radical  oppressive Islamic Law that put restraints on individuals.","they fail to see that just like the Bible, the Quran is only a tool to help an individual stay true to their religion.",and
23017_1,There is a lack of understanding of the Afghan culture.,It has delayed the rescue of the village.,Nan
14910_1,India is not nearly as multi-ethnic as the United States.,India is not poised to get into the racial situation that America does.,and
32576_1,"In my opinion, everyone should live their lives to their interpretation of ",what it means to be Catholic  whatever religion they are  both sides,because
37549_2,They found a way to forget it.,They simply advance in their life.,and
11289_1,That will influence the kid to take up to liking the sport.,It may possibly even motivate said child to play it.,and
20954_3,He could move to another country.,or choosing a different profession.,because
34619_1,It is  crazy.,hear from someone experiencing everything that you see on the news.,so
42183_1,I don't know much about these religions.,My opinion isn't very educated.,so
32461_1,I listened to Basim talk.,Basim was so forgiving.,and
29714_4,they probably have more resources., more support from their families towards that sport.,and
39593_1,Sam spoke about how Basim was severely injured.,Our hearts broke for him.,and
26418_3,He does it for a country that he loves too.,He only wants to see the country get better.,because
30064_2,"I've seen friends, family rally during hard times.","I've seen this rallying of friends, family happen due to their religion.",because
24372_1,Have tea with the man,He could possibly tell him what he wanted to learn.,because
38461_3,The saying black lives matter was too specific.,A classmate was saying.,and
27004_3,Extremist groups try to promote their own selfish agenda.,Extremist groupes use their bizarre interpretations of sacred text as justification for doing so.,and
21471_1,I am guilty of making judgment of other cultures.,It's because I was uneducated.,Nan
22035_1,"Nevertheless, Christians across the world still believe in the legitimacy of our religion.",Christians across the world become defensive when people speak ill of our belief system.,and
20495_6,They cannot be grouped together.,and generalized as the same.,so
37654_1,We live in modern America.,We have a unique opportunity available to us.,Nan
35094_1,Take over your country.,Exploit the land for the resources.,and
27936_5, it hurts him.,how broken damaged the city of Mosul has become.,and
25686_1,It is worse only knowing what the media shows.,You only know what the media tells you.,and
39270_2,To have his whole life destroyed.,The accidental bombing of Americans.,and
28988_1,Homosexuality is a perfect example.,Homosexuality is shamed in the Bible.,and
20242_2,It was disheartening to realize.,The majority of Americans view Iranians negatively. ,and
15068_4,It is truly amazing how much you can learn about a person's class.,by just listening to them speak.,and
36321_2,"Who are needy, want to be healthy, to have a family.",To have a good life.,and
34870_4,We are able to demean the criticism that we have towards them (the unknown or different).,We get the idea.,and
37943_1,I think one of the main reasons why he was able to forgive.,His understanding of the American people.,because
32457_1,We have differences in religious values.,We argue over religious values.,because
34389_3,It isn't completely their fault.,It is the topic of most concern for Americans regarding that country.,because
36527_1,Sam said something that really struck me.,It made me think.,and
8029_1,It is another reason to be proud of your roots., Be proud of the way that they molded your family over time.,and
36327_5,Our family is given freely., cannot be given a price.,and
32909_2,I have to expand that to the United States.,I have to expand that to Taiwan.,and
41559_2,He was given more time to live.,He should take advantage of it.,Nan
34836_1,I think President Bush was a selfish president.,He did nothing but bankrupt our country.,Nan
38036_2,I  think everyone has different experiences.,Everyone reacts in a different way.,and
31536_1,can I understand Sams perspective that the Bible may not be,specific enough that it caused it to be open to personal interpretations,Nan
14966_1,You state that majority of the population is intimidated to speak up about race.,They fear that someone else will take their opinions the wrong way.,because
19224_2,We focus on how we are racist.,We focus on how we are disapproving of anothers culture.,so
37780_2,We cannot be angry at every people of the country.,In real life they might be thinking exactly as the same as us.,because
34443_1,Coming from a high school.,With incredible diversity.,Nan
28899_1,Regarding that matter.,You think what you think.,and
24005_1,Afghan people can tell the difference between a foot soldier versus a killer.,Soldiers can tell the difference between a radicalistic versus a man protecting his lifestyle.,and
29522_3, what exactly I want to follow  the bible,"saying it is a good thing, I am  young, making mistakes in life.",and

39442_3,Not just near you.,All around the world.,Nan
11966_1,We should set our differences aside and link arms.,We should be able to support one another through the life that we are living.,and
38921_3,Basim is down to earth.,Basim is always trying to do the right thing,and
29257_5, there are many different beliefs ideologies.,we have I dont think any one group should impose those on another group from a legal standpoint.,and
20319_2,The LTC understood that the tea offer was a sign of respect.,The LTC was able to form a relationship with the village leader.,Nan
33486_4,They had really experienced the war. ,and understand the feeling of lost and numbed.,because
11820_2,Everyone wants to think their country is best.,This fuels the big American ego most of us have.,Nan
30998_1,"Even Though now in the modern days, divorce is become more common.",More female will divorce the husband for their own good.,and
40240_1,It is almost as if kids are raised in a bubble throughout their education.,They then find that the real world is much different than the idealized world they were presented with.,Nan

33545_6,He spoke brilliantly about how to push on., life feels like it is over.,so
26311_1,It's strange to be told that everything you thought about that country was not true.,"All the movies, and most of the news you've seen about the area are completely inaccurate,",because
41805_3,everybody in the world should the mighty Prophet Mohammed.,It is not fair to generalize a hate fear ideology on the rest Muslims.,and
11269_1,I can't believe it was so easy for me to assume someone was from the same region.,It was only based on the color of their skin.,Nan
26988_3,I was surprised that people like Mary were mentioned.,Noah was mentioned in some parts of the Quran.,and
30679_2,You put the video into your own words.,I was easily able to identify with it.,and
27476_3,they can be interpreted in many ways.,Sam's example were great for demonstrating this,and
11943_1,I have often watched sports throughout my life.,I wondered the same thing.,and
33172_1,I find this amusing.,"There are many Christians in the world, who swear by their religion.",so
38484_1,It makes me sad how sometimes horrible things happen.,there is no relief or sense of closure for the people.,and
31768_5,went there was to get this oil he compared that to,people coming here to get our coal it really made me think.,and
27373_1,It's easy to watch news separate ourselves from what's going on.,When we think about war deeply we think about what these people go through and put ourselves in their shoes.,and
25960_1,They did the best they could to learn from it.,They figured out the best way to live is together.,and
26735_2,We read what we want to read.,We read what he don't want to and base that on our opinions of being religious or not.,and
16467_2,Especially with interracial celebrity relationships.,Or interracial couples that we know in our lives.,and
29405_1,Who learned a lot listening to his story.,who showed all a class that people can forgive,and
24946_1,This man fought in a war against them.,He enjoyed the people along with the culture.,and

24238_1,Rafi talked and showed pictures of his family.,He talked about how he must fear for his life daily because of his job.,Nan
41543_3,"To fully empathize with others, a true reality of the world must be reached by those in the world.","Without a mutual comprehension of everyone's struggles, we cannot do a certain thing.",because
39528_2,He was married.,He had children. ,Nan
40005_4,Muslims have done terrible things in the past.,It does not mean in any way what so ever that all Muslims are out to harm others.,and
23084_2,They weren't sure they could give me answers.,They didn't understand it either. ,and
29033_1,The increasing number innocent afghan civilians who killed, is mind blowing.,Nan
30775_1,"I personally think the picture with people sitting around praying,",reading is the correct way to practice it.,and
34504_2,I believe expanding our knowledge beyond the confines of our own nation is of paramount importance.,The world is a large place.,and
30552_5,Something good can happen.,Something good will happen.,and
25449_1,Christianity is a religion that preaches peace.,Groups built on hate could not be Christians.,so
14591_1,Different types of people will be respected.,Different types of people will be understood.,and
39000_1,I think that it says a lot.,This is the way Basim views humanity.,Nan
36419_2,Then we go to other countries and do this. ,Then we offer a few grand in return.,and
30313_5,Certain people that change what the bible says.,It states how to act.,and
8714_1,America is perhaps the most diverse nation in the world.,Issues are going to present themselves.,because
15527_1,I found this lecture to be very eye-opening.,This lecture made me really look forward to the other topics Sam will be discussing.,and
15469_2,Other institutions like prisons replaced it.,The unequal treatment between races persisted.,and
42259_4,every class I have ever taken just revolves around the same thing.,I think that having the class change  often is what makes it such an interesting class.,because
30703_3,"all on the same level doesnt affect the way that we look at fornication, sodomy ",homosexuality all on the same level in the laws social culture that we live in,and
38043_1,It's shocking to me - the fact that we are constantly hearing about tragedies like this that happen to people in our own country.,the media turns a blind eye to the own atrocities we cause others.,Nan
26737_2,Those that take part in LGBTQ  community are sinning.,They say they can not go to Heaven.,and
26766_2,he tries to appeal to christian voters,he can stay in office,so
27213_1,The holy bible has multiple versions.,It has changed over time since its writing.,and
42115_2,Most people are biased on this subject.,It's because they only lived in the United States.,and
32047_1,I never had believed Muslim people to be evil.,I have always known they were peaceful people.,and
40830_3,I would handle the situation with such grace.,I would handle the situation with determination.,and
37615_1,I never thought.,I could relate to them as much  as I have through class.,Nan

35910_1,It was so admirable.,Basim did not feel that way.,Nan
42587_1,We should always read news from different sources.,We can see different perspectives.,so
9389_1,The culture between them would be more well known to more people.,The distinctions between them would be more well known too.,and
23340_2,It was much like Rafi's.,It was work that promotes peace in Afghanistan.,Nan
42401_1,The thought of being compared to these individuals makes me sick., I am my own person.,because
41958_1,He finds it difficult to go back to Mosul. ,He expects to be back in the next four months.,Nan
34737_1,This helps the catholic church., it seems they are losing touch with our generation.,because
19533_1,You commonly only think of the soldiers.,You think of the bad guys.,and
10604_3,I grew up in a diverse area.,I've been open to all types of people.,so
30477_3,In class we have seen that the religions are similar.,There is hate between such closely related things.,so
26783_2,I appreciate people like Rafi who can be that brave and act for their country and freedom.,The way our country is looking right now.,because
21898_2,The answer to this war is actually very complex.,The answer leads to many circling arguments and a massive headache.,Nan
29171_2,It allows people to learn about other races.,It allows people to break down stereotypes that surround some culture.,and
30493_1,People dont like feeling uncomfortable.,They will try.,and
8579_2,Sam can study different religions and the people that practice those religions.,Sam finds truth in all of them as a scientist.,and
29511_1, we see attacks against us Americans.,doesn't mean there aren't other Christians behaving the same.,because
22080_2,"Laws, in the past, prevented gay marriage.",Politicians are trying to find ways to pass laws now to limit it or stop it.,and
21346_2,Terrorism comes from selfish people.,They believe that the whole world should be as they prefer it. ,and
29326_4,adapted it to a way in which it worked in your life its that, the same thing that I have done in my life in regards to Judaism.,and
8287_1,Every race believes they are the superior race.,This is why all of the disconnect/ hateful nature come into play.,and
32826_1,Basim is such an inspirational person.,I admire him for his values.,and
32160_1,Some may think that Muslims are solely hostile.,"In reality, their religion teaches forgiveness. ",Nan
38120_3, I completely agree with what you said about not being able to live life only according to the bible.,i am able to live life only according any religious text.,and
33775_3,I thought some technical issue occurred with the projector.,Mr. Bassim appeared live on our projector.,and
34353_3,Americans are not associated with you.,Americans call themselves better than you.,and
31243_4,I do not think that it is realistic to think that everyone will not have oral sex before they are married.,Everyone has their urges.,because
34507_1,After hearing Bassim's story.,Reading your response.,and
23414_1,We just get to live in our own little bubble as Americans.,We do not care about people overseas.,and
10069_1,They are willing to take in strangers.,They are willing to invite them into tea.,and
29505_1,It was wonderful hearing their stories  seeing how two worlds that,have been  skewed by the media came together.,so

35804_3,I recognize it's importance.,I always try to keep in in mind.,and
13124_1,I think biracial dating has a bad reputation.,I don't understand why.,and
21086_6,I was always taught that god loves all of his children.,gay or straight.,because
31942_1,This is where he told us he is Muslim,his religion guides him to forgive,and
22712_1,One thing that shocked me was seeing the picture of 2 afghangirls in their late teens or early twenties.,I was shocked to see the clothes they were wearing pre-war.,and
9871_1,"Personally, I think SOC 119 has a good way of doing that without it being offensive.",Where people are open to asking questions/ being informed.,and
32848_3,There is no true answer with belief.,No one is wrong.,so
33331_1,I think often times we as humans like to sugar coat our situations and be positive.,Hopeful that a situation could get better to make us feel better or comfort us.,and
20442_1,There are currently 917 hate groups in the United States.,Most formed upon 1 sentence in the bible.,and
40648_2,It is such a basic statement that is simply common sense.,I think it's something we all forget time to time as Americans.,because
33820_1,Life was great until the explosion.,Sam exaplined.,Nan
40716_2,Basim talking to the class about his life was important. ,He helped us understand Muslims. ,and
30592_1,Thats super cool to me.,It shows that they love loving on people through the service they provide. ,because
31771_1,He showed us pictures of Basim's house.,He showed us how their lifestyle was not much different than our own.,and
38170_1,Carrying the burden of anger around with you is exhausting after a while.,It negatively impacts your ability to heal.,and
34595_4,No one is near.,Would it be stealing to pocket it?,and
37449_1,It is this refusal to accept blame that causes even more issues.,It makes the problem bigger.,and
26808_1,It's different than listening to someone that isn't from there speak.,You get a good understanding of life and culture in Afghanistan.,Nan
40900_1,"By the end of Sam's slideshow, I was feeling angry on behalf of Basim.",I was imagining the rage he feels towards the United States.,and
40571_4,His hatred eventually started to hurt him.,It hurt him more than it benefit him.,Nan
7665_1,I would think that their features would eventually change after few generations of living in the US.,Their features adapt to the new climate.,and

33348_3,How we do not have to be politically correct.,It makes it so much easier to talk about these issues.,because
32586_1,"Growing up, I have always gotten compliments on my eyes how", people thought that they were pretty.,and
31570_6,it struggles to decide he should go back along with many others.,it is who really dont know what they should do.,and
34622_1,Basim has the courage.,Basim has the strength to return to his country in four months.,and
32182_1,"which  you mentioned, I think it was really valuable him to bring us Islam","who how his religion teaches him to forgive  now,",and
41648_2,I want to say that it's not just our fault.,This is what we learned from news.,because
39125_2,On many citizens lives. ,On many religions.,Nan
32365_4,"our own country by christian Americans, we try to isolate those groups",like you said make them less than a true christian.,and
31308_3,Why the USA offered very little in reparations to Basim.,They basically destroyed his life.,so
33153_1, That different countries have to offer.,They dont get to experience the different cultures.,Nan
8231_4,Sports could be related to economics.,"Sports could be related to accessibility to equipment, etc.",Nan
8948_1,How each feature on my face can go bacck to my ancestors roots.,That our DNA is the same.,and

11847_1,"However, I don't know.",I don't even know if scientists know enough about genetics to answer that question.,and
41432_1,I feel like many just brush off the ugly sides of their own beliefs.,I feel like many just brush off the ugly sides of their own culture.,and
42110_2,"You get the full picture, too.",You do so without being influenced.,and

34912_2,we should acknowledge that we don't all have to be from the same race.,"we should look the same ,at the end we want the essential things in life.",and
20232_1,I believe Sams goal of this lecture was to open our eyes.,He wanted to try to change this from being the first thought that enters our mind.,and
41703_3,I pictured religion being important over there.,Everyone would want the combination of the two.,because
30868_1,I am orthodox christian,"I am familiar with the new testament, not so much the quran",so
32407_3,"Politicians in  out of my voting party, NATO, Doctors Without Borders ","other NGOs, both National  International news.",and
16133_2,We need to talk about it more.,It affects how people go about their everyday lives.,because
14581_2,The black people look to their idols.,The black people idols are basketball players.,because
41479_8, How black people in the exercise would get the job over a white person in the exercise.,They had the same record.,and

23675_3,There are real human beings just like us that live in places like Afghanistan.,We only see fleeting images of them on the news.,so
28375_2,I went to church a few times a month with my mom.,I was part of a youth group when I was way younger.,and
22057_1,That phrase on money is a reminder of what our founding fathers based the constitution on.,It is a reminder of the social climate of their time.,and
11969_1,"With that being said, I still thoroughly enjoyed talking about this topic.",What Sam said was 100% factual.,because
34112_1,On top of that he basically teaches almost 800 people about compassion.,It puts so much of our issues in perspective.,and
27280_2,God who teaches us to be forgiving.,God who teaches us to be charitable.,Nan

32977_1,America is supposed to take time to see the beauty of this other countries like they do to us.,"We will have more personal understanding of the kind of people they are as individuals, groups, families and not a country as a whole.",so
23806_2,People can pick out anything they don't like about you.,They can just decide they don't like you as a person.,and
34300_3,I found this lecture to be extremely eye opening,I found this lecture to be heartwarming.,and
40329_1,A big difference between Christianity.,A big difference between other religions.,and
35201_1,I like the word choice of detach., I couldnt quite pick the feeling I felt throughout every class.,because
39438_4,There are other people who have the same aspirations.,but we just have it so much easier.,and
42379_2,It's very much a part of their religion.,They have a lot of opportunites.,and
8702_1,Native Americans are often left unrecognized.,Native Americans do not have a very prominent voice.,and
19808_2,It seems obvious.,It is not easy to implement.,so
38225_1,So much more is going on in the world.,Americans seem to not know anything about it.,and
38092_1,Not having preset lectures just opens the door., many topics to discuss in class.,so
21361_1,I think that religion is a very interesting topic.,There are so many different perspectives and ways to interpret it.,because
40863_5,He deals with the pain.,He doesn't have hate in his heart.,and
33966_2,I would never be able to follow one religion.,There are so many that share my beliefs.,because
40093_1,Being born into a war torn flag is a crazy scenario.,It is unlike anything that happens in america.,and
39674_2,He was then very angry.,Then he realized that the anger wasn't good for him.,and
22530_1,"In this lecture and others, Sam brought up many good points about what we should do.",There are many laws that prevent us from doing things.,and
27383_1,I grew up in a time where the U.S. was at war.,The U.S. was at war the majority of my life.,Nan
38934_1,It's very important to take a step back.,We should be grateful.,and
36857_1,Maybe that was the point.,People have been dealing with these issues for so long.,and
22876_1,The military gets its soldiers to really believe that everyone on the other side is the enemy.,The military gets its soldiers to believe that they are not really humans.,and
38710_1,"Although it can be diminishing, it is also very intriguing and makes me actually want to learn about.","I would like to listen to people from different parts of the world, like Bassim, so that I can gain that kind of knowledge",and
33103_1,This is an issue.,We can'tkeep judging people without knowing them.,because
23403_1,Imagine how many other stories there are that we don't hear about.,We like to ignore the fact that America can be the bad guy overseas.,because
36092_2,I enjoyed how Sam at one point pulled that girl out of the crowd.,Sam asked what the girls thought about what she was wearing.,and
16019_2,"People fighting, the towns being nothing but waste.",Not a place where anybody would live.,and
15170_4,Some people find it hard to adjust to different lifestyles.,People find it difficult to adjust to cultures that differ from their own.,Nan
32962_3,"history from the view of individuals in the United States,which",which at the same time you were to be taught history from a perspective that doesnt,because
33255_1,I think that a lot of issues and events happening in the world between different countries and religions.,Stem down to the individual person committing these crimes.,Nan
25829_2,"In Afghanistan, they even have laws that help to protect against discrimination.","In the United States, we still haven't gotten rid of laws that discriminate.",Nan
42743_3,Based on the events that occur every year.,It's only what he is excited about.,because
30931_1,I agree we always celebrated Columbus day., In high school only had a small chapter in history class that addressed the inhumane ways the native Americans were treated.,and
27579_3,"They are everyday people, just like us.","They want the same things in life, to be successful.",Nan
22855_1,my dad's side of my family live in Germany.,This helped me to acknowledge the prosperity of somewhere other than America.,Nan
16239_1,It has nothing to do with economic differences between individuals.,It is a cultural result of something started many years ago.,and
36664_2,It made me think about how sometimes I overreact about small things that dont even affect me in a big way. ,He is able to forgive. ,and
42069_3,I personally would like to thank Basim  sharing his lessons with the class., it is really important to us to see other perspectives in the world.,and
38109_1,It affects more than just the city itself.,It affects the lives of the citizens.,Nan
10593_1,It took me a while to figure out what I was passionate about.,Learning is more important than just getting an education.,and
34308_6, I realized how lucky I am to be alive with friends., I realized how lucky I am to be alive with family.,and
10539_2,One is Italian.,The other is Indian.,and
27940_1,I'm glad he is doing okay., I'm thankful that he shared his story with us.,and
40163_1,It really takes a person with a huge heart.,It takes a person with a huge heart to forgive.,Nan
22242_2,There is a reason why people think like that is.,They do not want to educate themselves beforehand.,because
42352_1, I asked myself why that is., people in our country participate in acts of violence.,and
34475_1,this year Afghanistan with many other places to me were nothing more than something out of a Mad Max film., I mightve never expressed hatred I realize that I was wrong to think  low on the people who are trying to just live their lives in these places.,so
32995_4,People tend to be naive.,People tend to not accept their country's own faults.,and
11620_1,We killed the Native Americans.,We wanted to gain control of their land.,and
20005_1,They would be successful in finding the true evil in these towns,They could've worked with the townies versus being petrified by the unknown.,and
36095_2,I've learned it's good to ask questions.,Have conversations.,and
40007_1,you walked down the street,Ask the average American man,and
9583_2,I did feel like school was killing that passion for learning that I had.,"Luckily, I had a handful of professors who inspired me to learn more.",and
19216_5,I wonder why we think the way we do.,I wonder why we do what we do.,because
14611_1,Our university contains many multiracial people.,The campus is very diverse. ,and
19974_1,"In my opinion, the thought of Afghanistan may not seem real to people.",We are not physically living in the country.,because
11085_1,"I also think that when something funny gets posted, everyone can have a laught together.",It makes the conversation beforehand and after that much more memorable.,and
29408_2," both the Bible, the Quran are open to interpretation.", it is very easy  hate groups to manipulate the words in these books,because
32794_1,We are conditioned to internalize everything the media shows us.,I don't blame my friends.,so
27013_3,Countries like Afghanistan have quite unfairly become stereotyped as the hot beds.,Countries such as Saudi Arabia get far less publicity.,and
29416_5, terror doesnt mean that everyday life carries on normally., that a ton of people are affected much more heavily than we are on a daily basis by these terrorists.,and
8778_1,Suburbs have more places to play hockey.,There is more exposure to hockey for whites in my opinion.,and
30617_7,It is hard to relate to his hardships.,Where I was born made me lucky.,because
31831_1,I loved that he talked about how he was angry at one point., being angry would consume him control his life.,and
33186_2,not being exposed to lifestyles in Afghanistan and the middle east,It really at all makes it so easy for us to fall into this trap of hanging off the media's every last word.,Nan
39327_3,From the interaction that I had with him.,He seems like a kind person.,because
39545_6,That really sunk into me.,He has lost much.,because
42746_4,People in the USA generally view terrorist groups like the Taliban as Muslim.,They view ISIS as being Muslim.,and
42489_1,Social Media has corrupted us.,Social Media has corrupted our opinions of the world.,and
42279_2,The hijab actually takes that feeling away.,I thought it was incredible.,and
40400_2,The only way to truly know the goodness a person possesses is through personal conversation.,The only way to understand the quality a person possesses is through personal conversation.,and
28668_1,When will people realize?,Life is too short to have anything but love in their heart.,Nan
40517_7,They could offer any amount of money.,will not make up for the family he lost.,because
41429_3,Their courage inspires me. ,They hold no resentment towards us American citizens. ,because
39101_1, he did not join some militant terrorist group, Islam is not the religion of violence.,Nan
19932_1,It was really sad to hear that Rafi's partner got killed in the process.,You are right that no one deserves to go through that.,and
42088_1,I live by this every single day.,I have been through tough times.,because
26537_1,There are thousands of soldiers risking their lives.,There are thousands of soldiers losing their lives for this war.,and
10327_1,I feel like much of how we act is programmed into us.,This happens growing up.,so
33442_3, I realized how different we see our own government compared to the rest of the world.,How different compared to the citizens in Iraq.,and
27134_5,Those parents would also be excluded from heaven.,Christians don't spend a lot of effort to teach people not to do it.,and
34200_4,Basim was powerful.,Basim's story was powerful.,because
14764_2,"The reality is that, yes, there are sports where one race dominates another.","However, there are black players in the NHL, white players in the NBA.",and
28815_2,Physically hurting innocent people is the opposite of what a religious higher power would promote people to do.,Emotionally hurting innocent people is the opposite of what a religious higher power would promote people to do.,and
31855_1,which we go stereotyping how the Muslims act,"In of the Quran, we need to realize that Christians act in the same",because
42279_3,The hijab actually takes that feeling away.,I thought it was incredible.,and
31444_6,Women cannot file divorces.,Men can file divorces.,and
16328_7,Our culture would be much cooler.,We will be able to have legitimate discussions.,so
32591_1,"Overall, I loved this class  it made me overcome a milestone in realizing that these girls love who they are.", have much confidence  wearing their Hijabs.,and
34635_2,believing in something greater is comforting.,necessary for many peoplebut not for some.,and
35668_1,Americans struggle with the fact that  Muslims are different from the terroists.,That is why there is  confusion bout the Islamic religion in our country.,so
25782_2, It made me realize that everyone over there are real people.,They are not that different from us.,and
25921_1,We in America are primarily Christian.,We turn our blind eye to the radical Christians all over the world.,Nan
25123_1,I feel like people just want peace.,That is why they are indifferent to which side they choose to support or oppose.,so
41550_1,Everything is going on with the Middle East.,We don't think about the people's lives there.,because
34225_4,Frustrated with the American government.,The lack of respect they showed for Bassim's family.,and
41038_2,People should talk.,People should learn.,and
23861_4,We may think they should broadcast news reflecting the situation there.,People simply do not tune into that.,and
32888_3,It can be taken up by us in Soc119.,It will bring positive change.,and
39517_1,The class forces you to challenge the way you think about things.,It has for me.,Nan
32672_2,I just really liked all of the points that you talked about, they just make much sense really just show how,because
41882_1,They were accepting.,They were understaning.,and
36339_1,"In the bombing, everything is lost.",We talk to this forgiving person.,and
39343_1,What I felt was utter sadness.,What I felt was despair.,and
32422_2,He lost family members.,He was injured due to this accident.,and
10424_2,It comes from rarely seeing people of color in the area one grows up in.,It can come from never seeing them.,because
29156_2,your changed perception about situation in Afghanistan after being exposed to other angle of war are well appreciated,"sadly, media can be deceiving sometimes",and
20095_2,I heard about the pain and sorrow he went through.,I learned that this is true even in the hardest of times.,Nan
41768_1,I always wanted a class where we were free from having to worry about taking notes fast enough. ,I always wanted a class where we could sit back. ,and
38356_1,I know Basim said that he went to school in the United States.,Basim had a lot of American friend.,and
28247_3,These people had as much to do with the tragedy as I have.,These people had their lives torn apart.,and
32783_2,I am glad it has been a part of my life and upbringing.,I do feel that people should have more of a say in their beliefs rather than parents guiding the whole thing.,Nan
34555_2,It just shows how strong these women are.,It just shows how much pride they have in wearing the hijab for their religion.,and
31204_1,What really bothers me is when innocent lives are killed.,When people with good intentions are murdered.,and
20048_2,They automatically have the idea installed in their head that the nation was built off these issues.,They still currently exist.,and
20532_1,Dr. Richards talks about how important dialogue is.,Especially between military personnel and civilians.,Nan
42086_4,he is not angry thanks to his religion.," he knows that he was lucky to somehow survive the tragedy , he should not waste his life being angry .",because
31425_8,The Bible says to do certain things.,People do them.,and
23213_1,I began to think.,I realized one of my first thoughts is war when I think of Afghanistan.,and
26973_2,It made me think about how things weren't able to fully be adjusted.,Its a shame I wonder what the outcome would be.,because
34806_4,America did to him and his family., was not what the American people had done to him and his family.,Nan
22786_1,The war relies on the interests of other countries.,Afghanistan just happens to be where these countries hash it out.,and
39681_2,She asked the question.,I was wondering the same thing.,and
38922_6,He chooses love., to move forward without harboring hate in his heart.,and
9354_1,The world is becoming more of a melting pot in terms of race.,I think the same thing will begin to happen with these values over time.,and
29934_1,Most who have this view on Muslim are christians,I do not think they take a step back realizing there are various hate groups in christian religion,and
41366_1,Some orthodox Jewish women wear long skirts.,They wear long sleeves.,and
30722_4, that we are going to use it  a general template give us a general sense that,"how to live our lives, it should only be seen in a negative light you use",and
10158_1,I think that we need to come to terms with the fact that a lot of the things that America has done in its past was wrong and immoral.,Stop trying to pretend that these things didn't happen and move on without addressing them.,Nan
16271_2,I have a wonderful family.,I have a safe home to live in.,Nan
32083_6,There are rules highlighting the person being in need.,He talks about drinking.,and
10061_1,"They have cities, cars, traffic, too many people, not enough roads.",People are getting frustrated. ,and
29008_1,I agree with what Ethan said.,"Ethan said:""trying tomake more connections in class"".",Nan
15707_1,Years of mixing races and cultures results in a diverse society.,It will only grow more diverse and more mixing occurs.,Nan
24792_1,Technology breakouts modify things.,The way that a society adapts to a new idea changes. ,and
32347_2,Multiple people were killed for absolutely no reason at all.,No one even heard about it!,and
32378_1,The more people you meet of other religions cultures the more educated,that understanding you become.,and
40453_1,Bassim is another great example of how peaceful people who practice Islam are.,he devoutly follows his religion.,Nan
31174_2,Until people realize that these books were not written to govern bodies of people.,There will continue to be strife and sides taken on this matter.,and
40669_2,I completely agree with that fact.,Here's the first thing that came to mind when his story was told.,Nan
32339_8,can relate on a personal level  that is whatshisname trying to do-show us that all of these people ,who hate in the name of religion arent even following that religion.,and
35359_2,If people were as courageous.,Forgiving as Basim.,and
32814_1, I think what really makes the class is Sam the professor," with his style of teaching, his open mindedness, his openness",and
22544_6,We have thousands of different ideas and thoughts.,leading to confrontation and world wide problems with people who claim to share the same religion.,because
34828_2,The world would be much different.,We can all sit down with one another.,so
34262_1,Sam having other girls of non-Islamic backgrounds try them on.,it was a really interesting to hear how it didn't affect them at all.,so
14958_3,I understand the point of view Sam is trying to present.,but it has some discrepancies.,and
30778_1,"At first, this concept was very hard for me to understand.",I was raised being taught that it was clear which way to act.,because
11108_2,That is why it is such a big deal.,That is why it is so hard to get rid of.,and
26633_1,There are so many Christians out there with hate.,They have taken the Bible,and
32376_2,They have such different beliefs.,This isn't even true.,because
42427_1,Basim was able to forgive those who wronged him.,He could not be brought down by them.,so
42368_3,The members of ISIS have been brainwashed through their environment.,The members of ISIS have been brainwashed to believe America is evil.,and
7663_1,I never knew how different people can be.,Going by how they compare something as small as their nose.,so
11387_2,I enjoy white privilege.,Why is it uncomfortable to me?,so
34317_4,Bassim has inspired me to be a much more positive person.,Bassim has inspired me to help those around me.,and
25652_1,We never took the time to consider what that place is actually like.,It's amazing how normal along with how similar it is to how we live today.,and
33741_5,He continues to live his life.,He continues to share his story.,so
15908_2,It all depends on what you were exposed to.,It also depends on what you were taught growing up.,and
41571_3,it gives us the resources to reach out.,to learn more about whats happening on the planet that we all share.,and
42316_2,Innocent people dying are not acceptable.,Countries need to step back.,and
21410_2,It may be due to body adaptations.,The body adaptations date back before the beginning of these sports.,and
14589_1,Genetic diversity is going to continue.,Genetic diversity is going to expand.,Nan
35400_1,Stacy asked the question that was on everybody's mind.,How is he not angry with Americans?,Nan
11936_1,This country was built by immigrants.,"It seems that as a country, we have forgotten that.",and
33102_2,its really easy to say oh he just did that.,hes Muslim all Muslims do that.,because
13602_3,We don't have westernized names.,Pretty much all Koreans and Chinese students at Penn States have a westernized name along with their original name. ,so
35529_1,There is alienation of Muslims in the US through the media.,There is separation of Muslims in the US through the media.,and
28255_4,It is especially difficult for them,Their country is always involved in war.,because
21536_2,It can be very traditional.,It includes harsh punishments in order to establish law in our system.,and
40274_1,"However, following this lecture, I will begin to see things from a different perspective.",I will be less susceptible to judging.,and
32368_1,After 911 it has been hard for genuinely respectful kind people who follow the Islamic religion.,They live in and outside this county.,and
36521_2,He says we need a new perspective. ,Now the christian community has an opportunity to look upon itself as Muslims would look over on us. ,because
39562_1,There are countless people in this world. ,People like Basim are just the ones we should appreciate.  ,and
12772_1,"Soon, like Sam declared, our world will only be filled with people of one type.",They will be of mixed ancestry.,Nan
16466_1,"Also, I think some people just do it. ","They are attracted to that person, regardless of their race. ",because
10609_1,You are going to look past their flaws.,You date them.,and
38171_2,Basim wanted to put the pieces back together for himself.,Basim wanted to put the pieces back together for his son. ,and
42343_2,Yet here he is smiling.,He talks to a group of 700 college students.,and
25450_1,Many American Christians have a strong belief of right and wrong.,Many of them were also raised religious.,Nan
8313_1,It was brought up.,The answer seemed quite obvious to me.,Nan
29572_1,"This is exactly what Sam said, during this lesson.",It brought my attention to every word said that day in lecture.,and
25707_1,It made a lasting impression in my mind.,I felt it needed to be discussed further.,and
38676_1,We should be allowed to eat shrimp.,We should be allowed to wear mixed fabrics which would be not allowed in a sharia country.,and
27519_1,The next time I come across a situation I'll look more closely.,I will use a lot more introspection.,and
32719_2,We are very similar.,The culture of the United States is blind.,so
8407_3,I do not express sympathy for those who believe that their race is in danger due to intermingling between races.,"When you're hard pressed to find people who look like you, try your country of origin.",because
8602_1,Address these issues in order to move forward.,Make sure the closed- minded mentalities are being demolished as the world moves forward.,and
35916_2,The Bible is open to people to interpret things themselves.,why do people go killing others using what they interpreted from the Bible?,and
15910_3,This is a norm in today's society.,People need to stop looking at mixed relationships as a taboo thing. ,because
38818_1,Someone who truly worships God does not harbor such hatred towards specific people.,Someone who truly worships Allah does not harbor such hatred towards specific people.,so
36806_4,We call an act of terror by another just a shooting.,It creates an unfair divide.,and
40679_3,Who were just trying to get.,Who were not greatly concerned with religion.,and
13349_1,"That being said, inner city kids are usually people of color.",That is why they are good at sports such as soccer and basketball.,Nan
38989_2,thats what he did.,eing angry  the rest of his life wouldn't do him any good.,and
41532_1,I'm glad.,He was able to overcome something like that.,and
30703_4,"all on the same level doesnt affect the way that we look at fornication, sodomy ",homosexuality all on the same level in the laws social culture that we live in,and
10471_2,It builds in., In my opinion I think it involves more of biological factors.,Nan
9884_1,Silence holds us back from revolutionizing/ evolving into a better society.,The conversation is important.,so
41586_1,"One day, Sam got a bunch of notifications on his phone. ",He found out that Bassims house had been bombed.,and
21295_3,But a place where people live their daily lives.,Just like us.,Nan
33083_1,"Wrong, evil,  twisted  it may be, my belief is that the only thing stopping ",people like Bassim  I from going insane  getting retribution through ,and
33725_2,people just try to interpret the Bible in a way.,it seems somewhat controlling of others lives.,Nan
9623_1,"I was not exposed to many different cultures, I grew up to accept everyone.",I find other culture's ethnicities fascinating.,and
39604_3,I think Basim's ability to not be angry with Americans after what our government put his country through is so powerful.,It demonstrates the power of religion.,and
11323_1,It's due to the evolution of the people.,It's due to the backgrounds we came from.,and
39403_3,The fact that he was able to let it go shows how forgiving the rest of the world is.,how amazing the rest of the world is.,and
38226_1,It was amazing to hear from a man.,Lived through the war to tell his story.,and
21149_1,To understand that these events are serious.,They are happening to people just like us.,and
37919_5,"She learned grieving happens in a set way, most times starting with sadness.","In grieving, anger follows sadness, moving to forgiveness and acceptance.",and
37938_1,Last time we tried to help Iraq. ,We went back on our promises. ,Nan
32749_1,This is where I saw how different religions connect through that, these similarities how the world may connect through religion.,and
8382_1,I realized that it is something we can all relate to.,"Most people I know that have Irish blood usually have freckles, like myself, my friends, including family.",and
24181_1,I can also agree with what Sam said.,People have small differences overall.,Nan
38496_1,I never thought that the U.S. would mess up.,I never thought that the U.S. would bomb a resident's home.,and
21996_1,"There was nothing of value there, everything there was worthless.",Nobody of a worthy social class lives there.,and
23999_1,I have attended Sunday School.,I have gone to church my entire life.,and
21370_1,I think we all know what we call that.,It's a dictatorship.,and
24098_2,We can move forward with ideas of kindness and acceptance.,It would be better than the hatred some people choose to express.,so
20963_1,Everybody is always looking for their purpose in life.,Rafi has found his by trying to create peace his country.,and
27582_1,This war is addressing sociopolitical issues within the infrastructure of the country we are in,soldiers are there for the purpose of facilitation of these improvement and providing safe and open dialogue,so
36667_3,All of us were so angered listening to what someone had done to him.,He had moved on.,and
28105_2,It was my first time hearing about Afghan culture from an American.,The American has actually experienced it first hand.,because
34170_3,His house was destroyed.,His family members were killed due to a mistake by the United States.,because
32407_1,I changed the people I followed from Typical Girl Days to the United Nations,"Politicians in  out of my voting party, NATO, Doctors Without Borders ",and
32539_1,Our thoughts are evolving.,Our ideas are evolving.,and
33256_4,It's how I view the whole Black Lives Matter issues.,It's how I view the police brutality issues.,and
39261_3,What they do has a huge impact.,People like my classmates.,and
29171_3,It allows people to learn about other races.,It allows people to break down stereotypes that surround some culture.,and
34789_1,I wish that everyone could hear Basim's story.,People in America need to learn different realities other than their own.,because
10063_1,He has two very cute daughters.,America is working very hard.,and

42086_3,he is not angry thanks to his religion.," he knows that he was lucky to somehow survive the tragedy , he should not waste his life being angry .",because
32861_1,Many Muslims are associated with ISIS  the Taliban ,that we generalize all Muslims to be like that.,so

14811_1,I had some theoretical knowledge limited to the school textbooks.,I was never able to talk freely about it.,so
10837_1,These are just differences.,The differences should be accepted.,and
25125_1,This lecture was informative.,Soldiers need to study the culture.,and
31681_1,Sometimes it is taken more as a guideline to deal with everyday issues.,Sometimes it is taken more as a guideline to develop some sort of moral standard.,and

36820_6,There are a lot of problems in this country.,The world would be solved a lot faster than the current rate.,and
10958_1,I found your response interesting.,It was very different from mine.,and
15819_2,Sam was talking about the black Italians.,I've heard this before.,because
11600_3,It is just how people are raised.,They don't know any better.,because
28831_1,We saw what Raffi has had to go through (the bombing of his house).,Raffi lost almost everything he had.,and
10036_1,Sam tells us the point blank truth.,Many people aren't used to hearing it.,Nan
30062_2,"my cousins had their bar mitzvahs, bat mitzvahs, communions.", I sat respectfully in the crowd wondered.,and
35879_1,Imagine everything important to you was ruined.,It would be hard to keep going.,so
27510_1,This is a very ignorant statement to make.,Obviously a whole race a people cannot look identical.,because
41367_2,They dress in formal clothes daily. ,They wear Yamikas. ,and
15049_1,I agree with what you said here.,White guys rarely have an interest in black women.,Nan
38838_6,These terroristic groups are spreading conflict around the Middle East.,Civilians fear these groups.,so

34539_3,It's disturbing to me.,I have no idea what's going on in the other side of the world.,because
23937_1,Bassim is a good man.,I feel blessed I was  able to listen to his story.,and
26622_2,They recruit.,"Then, they brainwash child soldiers.",and
16273_1,The slideshow Sam showed had pictures of a traffic jam.,He had shopping mall pictures too.  ,and
38706_2,He is not angry.,He knows our governments goal.,and
19953_2,Bassim was not causing any problems.,Bassim was living a normal life.,and
10118_1,I did not know that the external differences between humans is a fairly recent shift.,I found that very fascinating.,and
11822_1,"As a nation, I think we should educate ourselves first. ",We should notice our internal problems before evaluating other countries and judging them by the image we make for them. ,and
39375_1,Everyone should be able to put themselves in someone else's shoes.,"Once you truly do it, it can change your views on the world.",Nan
21862_5,They are trying to make it by with their pride.,and to minimize war and external problems.,and

39303_1,This lesson on empthy.,The rest of the lessons taught in this class.,and
29124_4, my grandmother put up with a lot of shit., they both believed that they should never get a divorce.,because
34706_1,I didn't separate the two.,I never thought about it thoroughly.,and
34714_8,women who show off their bodies do  is they want to.,it should not matter what anyone thinks about it.,because

33507_1,"This conversation, I have more empathy  respect towards people"," who is living in Iraq, other war zones around the world.",and
40918_1,"By doing so, we might actually be able to do at least one thing.",We could show those that are wrongly hurt that we are sorry.,and
13382_1,This can create a society that thinks more about race.,One that constantly looks for the opportunity to point out our faults.,and
37091_1,Its so easy to just be careless.,Its easy to not take the time to look deeper into the reality of things.,and
36279_6,I can see myself becoming humble to every kind of culture.,I can see myself becoming humble to every kind of idea.,and
20343_1,It is to understand that people from other countries are extremely similar to us and how we live.,It is to sympathize with others to be able to first ourselves better in their shoes.,and
42330_2,They were taught.,There are not bad at heart.,and

20713_3,Conflict is not always a physical interaction with weapons.,It can also be an internal conflict about strategy or a way of going about a situation.,Nan
37683_3,the stigma of being Muslim is hateful and extreme,this man attributes his ability to forgive to it.,because

36231_3,They may take a stand,They may have more empathy towards others,and
29411_2, people are religious use religion to dictate their lives., I personally think it is best that people use religion to govern their personal lives.,and
30581_1,Thats why I find it hard ,to believe in Sharia law.,Nan
39805_5,I would feel extremely disrespected and hurt. ,I would no doubt think that the government was extremely corrupt. ,and
12353_3,A lot of our ancestors were brought here during slavery.,We have no record of who our ancestors were.,because
39418_4," do not judge people, know them first.",generalizing cultural characteristics gets in the way of our judgement.,and
39248_1,"At that moment, I realized.",It could have happened to anyone in a foreign country.,and
26470_2,The wounds of the past could heal.,We could begin to move forward.,and
41266_1,I am supportive of everyone.,I am accepting of everyone.,and
42097_1,His speech did make me feel extremely grateful.,I realize that life is amazing.,and
36273_3,I had no idea about his background. ,I would have no idea he had suffered such great losses. ,and
39226_1,He basically explained that he has encountered many Americans.,He basically explained that he has established relationships with many Americans.,and

22968_1,"Hopefully now on, I will remember what I read is not the whole truth.",I should look beyond that.,so
11299_1,I also think its very difficult to ignore the books of Charles Darwin.,I think it's difficult to ignore his evolution theories.,and
37074_2,Bassim lost is something that would break people., people lose their minds.,and
8138_1,"Instead, everyone tends to focus on the negatives,",Everyone tends to make a big deal whenever there is bad situation with race.,and
19690_1,I think we do this. ,It's the easy thing to do. ,because
29624_1,African American don't play basketball because they are good at it,Caucasians don't play hockey because they are good at it,Nan
25433_1,We only rely on the fact that this is happening really far away.,It might not affect us directly.,and
30312_3,Muslim religion is much like our own.,Few change what is written.,so
42498_6,I celebrated many Hanukahs with my friend's families.,I celebrated Yom Kippur with them.,and
41029_2,Some of them are in our Soc119 class.,They would be shocked by what happened to Basam.,and
37681_4,Bassim lost all of his belongings. ,He has learned to forgive the United States for taking all of that away from him. ,and
9770_1,I agree.,It's important.,Nan

41189_2,He said initially he felt very numb and confused about all of the utterly terrifying and traumatic things that have happened to him.,A few months later he was angry for a little while,and
15153_1,We must embrace the good aspects.,We must embrace the bad aspects too.,and
21505_1,The houses that get destroyed.,The lives that get taken are from innocent civilians who had nothing to do with the war.,and
33453_2,Understand a culture is by getting out of the darkness.,Experiencing reality ourselves.,and
42410_1,We have to acknowledge both sides. ,They commit these crimes.,and
14958_1,They have two extremely large populations.,They have to diverse populations.,and
24042_1,Sam then mentions a strong argument regarding Donald Trump.,The argument can be used for other politicians.,Nan
32292_2,I can't imagine how hard it must have been to think rationally.,I can't imagine how hard it must have been to think that it's not the American people themselves who are causing it.,and
19588_1,"For instance, with international business, there are certain etiquettes. ",There are best practices when interacting with different cultures.,and
30934_2,Their lives became separate.,Blacks were only allowed to drink from separate water fountains.,and
24119_1,He was such a good man.,"He was educated, well spoken, courageous.",Nan
32571_1,There are many things that are,not even addressed in the Bible,so
33741_2,Bassam said he feels he was left in this world for a reason.,He continues to live his life.,so
40633_3,It is so hard to relate.,Sam makes it pretty easy to see the other side.,because
9567_1,"Reading articles, looking at pictures and maps only scratches the surface of learning about cultures.",The lifestyle that people live outside your own little bubble (wherever that may be).,and
15103_5,Differences are important.,because that is the same way I feel.,and
30834_6,There are many people out there with twisted mindsets.,Many people out there with twisted mindsets stand for something.,so
30737_1,This is the second week in a row.,I've been really shocked.,Nan
7546_1,This issue has become extremely prevalent with the recent events.,It has revealed the white supremacists living in the USA.,Nan
8070_1,I have started to pay closer attention to my friends appearance and their ancestry.,It is fascinating,and
35148_1,"I am an Eagle Scout, I have done a lot of exploring myself",hearing about his experiences in the desert was very interesting.,so
35036_1,I agree with you that this lecture by Sam stood out.,I never hear of the Establishment Cause either.,because
22276_2,They are out of our norm.,We do not take time time to put ourselves in the shoes of the soldiers or learn more about the wars we are fighting.,and
39886_1,I was a little disappointed with how the group took it., felt that it dragged on very long.,because
30582_2,It is just so hard for me to grasp a government style that is run interwoven with religion.,America has so many different religions yet none of them interfere with laws.,and
40458_2,He shared his feelings from the time that it happened.,He shared what he has done with his life since then.,and
14633_1,We recognize mixed race groups.,They are oftentimes lost within the strict racial barriers of the world.,because
29702_1,Your response about Native Americans is correct.,Your response about Native Americans is very unfortunate.,and
30149_3,"He created an idea regarding premarital sex, co-habitation, use of alcohol, women's rights, wealth, charity.","The idea covered the use of violence, killing in self-defense, too.",and
10054_1,"Other than this problem, I only see the benefits.",Good can come out of using social media in class.,Nan
9129_7,This is proof that we are barely different., we would not have as big of an issue with racism and social barriers.,and
35983_1,"In my post, I made a huge push for people to lead their own life.",They need to be more skeptical of everything.,and
41703_2,That was intriguing to me.,I pictured religion being important over there.,so
40222_2,This ignorance is literally affecting other people's lives across the world. ,We continue to make the wrong choice in our decisions. ,and
29740_1,I have seen both sides,they are not different at all,and
26342_1,Some people see a man from the Middle East.,They automatically believe that they are a potential threat.,and
42441_1,It was really nice to listen to Basims answer.,Basim's answer to all the questions everyone had.,Nan
14813_1,Hey Sean.,I agree.,Nan
41190_2,he had a close relationship with many American citizens,he knew that it was not in a lot of Americans best interests to destroy lives the way they had destroyed his,and
41265_1,I think we are kind of taught to fear Muslims.,This may be for good reason.,and
40058_1,"In former times, Sharia was interpreted by independent jurists.","They based their legal opinions on Quran, Hadith.",Nan
15388_1,It is impossible to tell the tone of the person who is posting.,It is unclear whether they are being hurtful or playful.,so
34285_2,No amount of money that can fix what has happened to him.,No amount of money that can fix what has happened to his family.,and
15818_1,It depends on which sports is most influential among your peers.,"It depends, more importantly, on your family members.",and
22639_2,Violation is based on its obsolescence.,The right to bear arms seems to be as in vogue as always.,and
16352_1,There's the true reason why people are dating outside their race.,It has become less of a problem.,because
33388_1,"However, speaking to a real person, who lost almost everything in this chaos, that ",was both mind-blowing  heat-shaking.,and
33501_1,Empathy is described  the ability to understand  share the feelings of ,another by Merriam Webster dictionary  that is really what this class is trying ,and
41867_2,I think my favorite part of this lecture was Sam giving one of the Muslim women a high five.,She said no.,and
31950_1,He lived for awhile in America.,He got to see,and
19961_1,I listened to definitions of forgiveness from all different types of people in the class.,Not a single person truly defined the word.,and
19554_1,I believe that this perception has been created by the media and by the movies.,Highlighting the negative aspects of life.,Nan
9524_1,Others there talked about race.,"By talking about race, they were able to create better racial equality.",and
28817_2,Don't promote hate groups,Promote peace.,Nan
21998_1,It's easier.,Most people agree with the default option.,Nan
35227_1,"He lost his wife, daughter, brother",I believe that is the saddest thing I have ever heard.,and
31038_4,We have all barely expanded our boundaries.,We do not know about other cultures around us.,because
9077_3,I want to love all religions,I want to understand all cultures.,Nan
27026_2,"They have families, with children.",The children also have hopes and dreams.,Nan
29124_1,My grandmother my grandfather met each other in the church., my granddad was an asshole to everyone in the house apparently.,and
31260_2,They are protecting themselves with weapons.,Whereas Rafi just tries to stay peaceful,Nan
8580_1,I am excited to learn about different beliefs and the people who believe in them.,It reveals how similar humans beings across time and space truly are.,because
40211_1,I completely agree., Bassim explained how much control the media has over what we see.,and
9972_1,"Studying for my ACTs, I found myself becoming more educated on topics.",I was simply remembering facts.,and
36090_4,I would never ask them why they wore what they wore.,I would never ask them what it meant to them.,and
28674_2,"Whenever times get tough, I know not to make excuses.",There are other people who have lost so much.,and
27177_2,"Controversy is almost inevitable,",It truly is hard to think that so much destruction is being done in order to resolve a problem.,and
11155_3,"These are the streets they live on, walk to school on.", and walk their baby carriages on.,and
31768_2,he continued talking about how a primary reason we,went there was to get this oil he compared that to,and
39399_3,I find him admirable when he says he believes he will return to his home in four months. ,I know I would not be able to return after such a travesty.,because
24252_2,Afghanistan gathers it's people.,They use ink to make their selection permanent. ,and
25443_1,Sam explains Islam Sharia Law.,Being just one of many ways of interpreting the Quran.,Nan
28608_2,They cant agree what Jesus meant.,Jesus said one thing.,and
40732_2,This helps you learn to grow an appreciation for others situations.,It helps to open your mind to the possibility that someone has it harder than you.,and
35406_8,They have strong faith.,It was inspiring.,so
12066_1,A case that does a good job of presenting.,This class is based on the pursuit of understanding the social dynamics between different cultures.,and
20164_1,I'm sure there are many others.,That is just unacceptable to me.,and
41738_2,I wish that every American could speak with Basim.,I wish that every American could hear his perspective.,and
32183_1, think at the heart of most religions is essentially just the,message of being a good person,Nan
27821_3,Engaging in other things denounced in Corinthians.,"Specifically the fornicators, sodomites, and the drunkards.",Nan
33619_1,Another point Sam made.,Sam was arguing about the bible.,and
41464_1,You cannot find all the answers in any of these books.,You do.,and
15230_2,We have man-made protectors from the sun and UV rays.,It is still fascinating to see.,Nan
32234_3,The Quran is a book of teachings.,The Quran is used to establish a system of law.,Nan
21098_1,Why do people have to put their lives on the line?,Why are civilians losing their lives?,and
7971_3,I needed to learn about other races and religions.,That was my driving force to take this class.,and
11076_1,The point you made about religion.,How religious people do not look at the scientific viewpoint.,Nan
39630_1,I love how we are learning about things that are actually relevant to our lives.,We don't have that disconnect with what is going on around us.,and
36674_3,He lost almost everything due to this country.,"He patiently spoke, answering everyone's questions.",because
35812_5,We walk around every day with rage towards someone.,We walk around every day with rage towards something.,and
27623_2,all things read and seen by us are subjected to our own interpretation,our interpretation aims to justify our believes,and
36991_12,forgive more not being angry., and having resentment to people who have hurt us.,and
10253_1,Don't ignore the topic.,Ignore the media.,Nan
39830_1,I do agree that it is eye-opening to see how the military really does treat other countries.,It is eye-opening to see how easily we  take lives from innocent people.,and
37513_1,"He started class with  the discussion of the tragedy that occurred on 9 11,",It was no surprise considering the purpose of this course.,Nan
21607_1, How can we stop ISIS?, The only action we seem to use is military force.,and
41649_1,I don't mean that it's OK to hold stereotypes towards other cultures.,What I'm trying to say is that the people of the press have responsibilities.,Nan
22312_2,This shows that maybe there is some respect between the two parties that cab help them find a middle ground.,They can stop the attacks on each other.,and
25297_2,"Look at the NBA, the NHL. ",There is diversity throughout the leagues.,and
42169_2,How I judge others based on race.,On cultural differences.,and
39631_4,there were major acts against humanity.,millions of people were murdered really puts into perspective just how minuscule.,and
40272_3,I as well read A Thousand Splendid Sons.,I have dealt with divorce from a personal level as well.,and
12470_1,I always thought People should admit that slavery was a complete atrocity.,It really only happened because it could.,Nan
15917_1,I did find it inspiring.,I heard Rafi's reasoning behind continuing on with his work.,Nan
42012_2,Mosul can find solitude and tranquility.,Other countries who have experienced the worst of downfalls can find solitude and tranquility.,Nan
29194_2,who is the definite meaning that Quran,It wants to understand.,Nan
31462_1,"It is even more important that we understand the culture, customs, that", courtesies of those countries that we deploy to.,and
37061_2,People have had horrible things done to to them and the people they love., they didnt take the route of forgiveness like Basim did.,and
36715_3,I think a lot of people need to be reminded of the fact that not everyone will think the same way as you.,That is OK,and
22877_1,This helps them to be able to kill people.,They do not feel as intense emotions while fighting.,and
42424_1,He decided to stop being angry about the awful tragedy that happened to his family.,He moved on with his life. ,so
19344_1,"They want to impose laws on abortions, sex education, teaching evolution in schools, and so many other issues.",This is based on religious reasons in fundamental opposition to the constitution.,Nan
22178_2,People are just posting some constructive criticism of an opinion.,The engagement in our lectures is off the charts.,because
33213_2,The media is  mostly to blame  that they seem to cover a ,terrorist attack to a significanly larger degree  a Muslim is responsible ,because
41725_3,He could have decided to hate America forever.,He finds solace in our country's people.,and
33547_1,I think it is so easy to take the bad that life gives you and turn it into pain or hatred.,The way Basim was able to turn it into forgiveness and find purpose in his life.,Nan
37876_4,It is amazing to me that he can put those feelings aside.,It is amazing to me that he can continue to respect his American friends.,and
7694_1,"I can confidently say that I know people of almost every race that are rich, poor, upper class, lower class, smart, dumb, gay, straight, male, female, religious, nonreligious, democrat, republican.",The list goes on.,and
32218_1,I am sure there are a wide range of ideologies opinions throughout,SOC 119 class but in the grand scheme,and
40255_5,Basim was able to learn to forgive the United States for all of the pain that they had caused him.,That is what God wants.,because
11939_2,The best way to take steps towards resolving.,Resolving is exactly what is happening.,and
37399_1,I was more shocked that not everyone realized this.,Its so disturbing that we have to take a class in order to understand the importance of another human being.,Nan
39288_2,I came to this realization about myself.,I find it  laughable that it surprises some people that people overseas don't like America.,so
16232_3,Many believe you need to be agile.,Many believe you need good eye sight.,Nan
30654_3,"In reality, they do have aspirations. ",They have families too. ,and
36246_1,This is why.,This class is important.,so
33750_5,We go and fight on other peoples’ land. , but are never in the depth of a war as far as our civilian population goes.,because
34730_1,I have always thought that the bible is outdated.,I find it crazy that people try to live by what is said in to a T.,and
42691_4,It made me realize how ignorant it is that we don't explore other cultures.,We are all the same same and have familes and jobs.,and
27554_3,we should take responsibility for both good and bad things happening t ous,it could diminish hate,and
22242_1,There is a reason why people think like that is.,They do not want to educate themselves beforehand.,and
40727_2,They are just like any other civilian here.,They have values.,Nan
40519_4,That's especially true when you mentioned that the American bashing should stop.,The discussion of American history should be a lesson for future generations.,because
40836_2,Its glorification was not something that was a great thing. ,"At the very least, it was something that could be considered honorable for the people fighting. ",and
40435_1,"Still, I wonder.",The United States does not intervene.,and
38949_1,I am in disbelief on Bassims ability to be forgiving to people.,The country that caused a very dark time in his life.,so
25403_3,"l radicalizing their own interpretations of that particular faith, "," I think that it should be very clear,",because
40694_1,Basim stated during the first few months he was numb. ,He did not fully comprehend what had happened to him. ,and
28190_1,People think Muslims want to come to America.,People oppose sharia law in America.,and
38790_2,His faith tells him to forgive. ,He is a devout follower. ,and
30940_1,Its shameful to think my country supported something like that in a sense to  feel like our government may support.,things like the KKK maybe not necessarily in monetary funding.,and
8425_2,White people were more prevalent in colder climates.,White people excelled in hockey longer than places that are just becoming popular with hockey.,Nan
32024_1,The video I chose to reflect on this week was A Conversation with Basim Razzo.,I chose this video.,Nan

46349_1,If the same circumstances had happened to me.,I don't think I could learn to forgive.,Nan
43538_2,You need to respect what people believe.,You need to let everyone follow their own path.,and
43662_1,It was a little eye opening.,"In Sam's one lecture, he shows the class.",Nan
44416_1,"Like Sam said, many people use the bible to justify their actions.",Everyone can interpret the words in their own ways.,and
44100_2,We should approach race relations in America with an ever-changing mind.,We should accept different views.,and
44875_2,I have learned about the hardships that blacks had to face.,They are facing it.,and
44036_1,I put myself in his shoes for a second.,I thought. ,and
45422_1,I think Sam did aI think Sam did a great job almost mediating the group discussion by addressing the general opinion of white people great job almost mediating the group discussion by addressing the general opinion of white people,the general opinion of black people but rather just switching them so white people are feeling as if they are oppressed.,and
45230_1,"I believe that most Americans, are ignorant to the outside world.",hey ignore what they dont want to hear.,Nan
44725_1,It is important to empathize that there is more to life than the simple issues we have every day.,It is important to understand that there is more to life than the simple issues we have every day.,and
42974_1,A lot of people don't understand. ,There are so many issues that need to be discussed.,Nan
43659_1,That is one of the reasons I like this class.,It talks about some of the falsification that was put on a group of people.,Nan
46443_3,Mark said it's not the physical aspect that is hard.,You have your mind under control.,and
45929_2,It's how the racial status that the United States has today was started.,One civilization was a little bit more advanced in technology.,and
45662_3,It really opened my eyes to the truth.,It was not what the media wants us to think.,because
43262_7,It's in the news a few weeks.,It takes up a lot of our attention.,so
46253_1,It is very hard to keep those in heart when all of those are going on. ,There is no date for the ending.,and
44033_4,It is an act that can be easily brushed under the rug.,The bomb only hit two homes.,and
45998_1,I agree.,There are faults on both sides.,Nan
46374_2,We overlook black history.,American history is more important than black history.,and
42804_2,He has done a lot of good.,Many other police officers have suffered some consequences along the way.,and
43506_1,This habit of making assumptions is partially to be blamed on the human brain.,It is partially to be blamed on the way humans evolved to judge enemies and situations I think.,Nan
44980_1,Have an open mind.,Don't take everything to heart.,and
44696_1,I had no idea newer textbooks left out the word slave in them.,It seems really crazy to me.,Nan
43872_1,He said he grew up christian.,He then converted to islam.,and
44164_1,It is important to understand that not all police use brutal force,Some are hurt or killed while on duty.,and
43114_4,majority of Christians are white people.,They dont think about terrible things.,because
46074_1,Certain white people have argued that by banning slavery was enough to help black people,Not aiding support to former slaves made conflict unavoidable.,Nan
45275_5,I had never considered how weird it would be to be always looking at pictures of groups of white people.,I had never considered how weird it would be to  only seeing my own culture in negative depictions.,and
45618_4,That will only cause more tragedies happen.,To forgive his enemies there is no other way that will benefit not only him,so
44429_1,"Much like Basim, you can sense the anger.",You can tell that he is more than capable.,and
43322_2,"Whether we might share many similarities, we are quick to judge others who seem different from us.",We call their ideas weird.,so
43531_4,I personally think it is because people are afraid of the truth,they don't know how to find a solution.,because
45863_2,The white people could only base themselves on surface knowledge.,The only people could only base themselves on things that were presented in the media.,and
45094_1,Sam's approach to this lesson was interesting.,He helped make the material easier to discuss.,and
44713_1,Of course he was numb when the bombing happened.,His whole world was falling apart.,and
44848_1,The girls put hijabs on students who don’t usually wear them. ,How they felt really surprised me. ,and
44710_1,I was surprised.,Sam told us that Bassim was on the screen skyping with this class.,so
43207_1,There is so much corruption in the police departments across the country. ,We don't screen for bias. ,because
45463_5,that is where I felt that white people were at their most ignorant due to the ingrained inequality thought process that,has plagued America since its founding.,and
44278_2,They discussed their perspectives on the black and blue lives matter movements.,Their opinions and information on both surprised me.,Nan
44228_3,They are truly the ones filled with hate.,This is what is so funny.,and
45841_1,For us to be able to have empathy about certain topics and events that have happened allows for people to get along.,For us to be able to have empathy about certain topics and events that have happened allows for people to understand each other.,Nan
45399_2,It just isn't spoken about.,White people will not be spoken about.,because
44287_1,During their campaign the begin with false promises. ,They are unable to attain those ideas. ,and
43215_1,Religious texts give us a foundation from which to make a civil life.,Many of the details are left to us. ,Nan
43252_3,I certainly liked Obama more than Bush.,I think that I just kind of assumed that he would have had a more positive reaction coming from an Iraqi.,so
46268_3,I kept thinking everything the white black people were saying was very rude.,That is probably exactly how they see Americans making the same arguments.,and
45850_2,I learned the person's perspective on people matters a lot.,It not only affects the time at the moment.,and
43050_1,Bassim seems to be a very fair person.,Who has a level head.,Nan
44520_2,I feel like that was done purposefully.,I think  about it.,and
43906_1,Christian violence is not being talked about more.,Christians tend to be hateful more often than Muslims are,because
45734_4,One third is full of people who want equality.,The last third does not care about anything.,and
46424_1,I'm not exactly sure why she disliked it so much.,I personally never judged anyone who wore a hijab.,because
45265_2,People look different. ,They have different beliefs. ,because
42871_7,We don’t truly understand what we are. ,We don’t truly understand who we are. ,and
45755_1,I say selfishly because their situation never once crossed my mind before this lecture. ,After this lecture I couldn't help but think I could be doing something..,and
44830_2,Lacking the knowledge of Iraqi citizens.,Lacking the  experience with Iraqi citizens.,and
42944_1,I truly enjoy and appreciate listening to all of his experiences., it gives me a great deal of insight on how blessed I am to never have experienced something  terrible,because
46365_2,we didnt do this.,we do not know the people who did this personally.,and
45020_1,They reacted as If they didn't care at all.,They should basically just get over it,and
42910_1,I don't know how we as a generation go about fixing this issue.,I think a good place to start would be to stop generalizing people.,Nan
43166_2,The answer was clear.,The media portrays many more unarmed black deaths by police.,so
43143_1,He would simply finda,His youngest recorded victim was 12,and
45418_5,"All I would be able to think would be, Why couldnt it be me?",Basim should be someone that everyone aspires to be.,because
42844_2,it make feel ,i like it.,Nan
46490_1,People don't realize that their skin color adds stipulation to their lives.,Ignorance exists in this world.,because
44097_2,We barely see it in the news anymore.,Trump has done minimal things to help them.,and
43290_1,Bassim told us an important message.,It was was to be passionate about other people.,Nan
46233_2,It brings us back to the way men look at women in these cultures.,It brings us back to the expectations we have of them.,and
45862_3,They could explain why the white people had historically thought of these crimes as okay.,They could justify why the white people had historically thought of these crimes as okay.,and
44649_1,"In todays time, living in America,",it is hard to feel that someones clothing offends you,and
44735_4,Sam began talking about how Africans simply used their resources/wit to travel up through Europe.,They captured slaves who propelled the Africans' development.,and
43376_5,I think it's something a lot of adults tend to forget.,"They don't see others as real people sometimes, primarily in the context of war.",because
44585_5,I understand why he has those sentiments towards the United States.,He has those sentiments towards its leadership.,and
45482_4,Men are being made to grow a beard.,They cut their ankles.,and
44053_1,There are stats to prove it.,Most African Americans are treated unfairly in society.,Nan
45860_2,Pictures of the different things such as lynching and post-slavery life.,You see how poorly people were treated.,Nan
44202_3,People with similar ideologies look to the Quran.,People find something that justifies their beliefs.,and
46310_3,They pretty much set the rules.,They controlled the outcome.,so
44822_3,He could learn not to be judgmental.,So can everyone else.,and
46452_4,They only cover their skin for unfamilar men.,They only wear their hijabs for going outside.,and
45624_2,We were required to take more history classes.,These issues are so important.,because
44950_5,Obama served in office.,Trump have served in office.,and
45113_3,Im just not sure why.,Someone would look at a black person.,because
43896_5,This is a problem.,many of us have fallen into.,and
43021_2, It would make us look bad.,Why do people in the U.S. make such quick judgements about people who are different?,because
44228_2,Groups like the Alt Rigth and Ku Klux Klan call themselves Christians.,They are truly the ones filled with hate.,so
45268_2,Beliefs will always cause people to fight. ,They will fight people in and outside of their religion. ,and
44735_7,They were eventually taking the native land in the Americas.,they thought they were the first to discover the land.,because
45243_1,Here's another important thing to note.,Many of the critics are also Trump supporters.,and
45799_4,we judge their culture from afar.,We assume that all Muslims act the way we see the select few of them act on the news.,and
43997_1,Today's class was on the recent protests against police brutality.,The expected results of more black people than white people getting killed by police was false.,Nan
43636_2,Miss out on advantageous relationships with foreign nations.,We choose not to learn about them.,and
44991_1,The video was mostly just explaining the history.,More people should do what Sam did.,and
43914_2,There are people suffering like this overseas.,It's horrifying to learn.,and
43597_5,He tells us what the United States government did to Basim.,He tells us what it did to his family,and
44984_1,It doesn't characterizes someone in any certain way.,I think that should be emphasized more in this day.,and
43507_1,"At this point in time, we need to train ourselves out of this reaction.",We can come together more as an entire species.,so
43813_1,It drives me nuts.,We correlate someone's actions to their beliefs.,Nan
45701_2,I was quick to judge.,I had my own privelage.,because
42823_2,I thought about how Muslims in Iraq may be looking at Christians.,They might think we are all bad.,and
45011_4,We've been seeing many instances where police brutality has become really bad.,Police are killing black people.,and
45832_3,These athletes are doing it peacefully.,It shouldn't bother anyone.,so
42792_1,We learned this isn't an excuse for ignorance.,It only causes more destruction.,because
46347_8,This hatred happens to good people.,"who worked hard, and yet were not accepted the same freedom because of their skin.",and
45802_1,I think it is more important we realize it is humans that are killing humans.,Instead of generalizing saying that certain religions are killing each other.,Nan
43213_1,a Sharia system is made out of a religious text,It is the very reason many people of any religion get into arguments over the true meaning of certain doctrines.,so
44624_1,There are starting to be a lot ore white NBA superstars.,There was a bias that only black people can play ball.,because
46254_1,"In my opinion,  faith is what really bring people together","I hope more people in Iran can be like Basim, holding their faith .",and
44340_1,Different media sources can choose to publish some articles concerning war.,Different media sources can restrain others.,and
46433_1,Another thing I noticed.,You noticed it too.,Nan
46272_1,I think this is a lesson.,seeing different perspectives.,Nan
43474_1,It's funny how individuals choose to deal with their pain.,I have come to realize something.,and
43466_3,To get to engage in dialogue with someone.,From a culture that is different from our own. ,and
45618_8,To forgive his enemies there is no other way that will benefit not only him,to forgive his enemies there is no other way that will benefit others.,so
43668_3,Everyone should explore every opinion in politics.,Everyone should explore every opinion in religion.,and
43308_1,it make feel good,very like,and
45786_1,Those who think slavery is bad (and it was).,They should research the lives ended by the use of word privilege.,Nan
43086_2,I have not been taught to care about their history.,I have not been taught to care about their current events. ,and
45326_3,The American President made no difference to Basim.,The American Presidents continued the same agenda.,because
43287_2,I know our history classes are all about white history in the United States.,The only time we ever even consider exploring other topics.,and
43081_3,They need aid from people that will help them build their lives how they want to in order for them to be in peace. ,Everyone wants to have normal lives.,and
44235_1,Luckily I can say I grew up on a place that was very diverse.,I had parent who were very open to everyone.,and
43089_3,Everyone kept to themselves.,We live in a global society.,Nan
43757_5,We judge their situation without thinking once.,"We do not ask ourselves, why?",and
45791_2,Anyone reported to have any privilege were gassed.,Anyone reported to have any privilege were starved.,Nan
46347_1,This kind of hatred is almost unimaginable.,This hatred does not happen to dangerous criminals.,and
44176_2,We fellowship with our brothers and sisters of all races.,We become more well-rounded individuals.,so
43779_3,The job of the media is to create stories for their demographics.,The stories should inform but also keep them invested in the program.,Nan
46219_5,The presentation showed me the BLM movement is a product of history.,The presentation showed me that white privilege is the product of history.,so
43545_2,This clip was one of the best parts.,It is so important for people to be more aware.,because
43579_3, I do hope they are more careful.,These are real people's lives at stake.,and
45560_3,White adolescents are well educated.,White adolescents see stories of black crime on the news.,and
44553_4,Maybe the United States government can't stop the war due to their conflicting differences.,I wish they at least took into consideration families like Basom's.,and
43934_1,I do not think.,They are directly trying to disrespect veterans.,Nan
45007_5,They make people angry.,It causes people to go against what the players stand for.,and
45576_2,I never really thought about this issues before.,they never directly affected me.,because
43043_3,I found out that people lost everything and in many cases.,It is due to our decisions as a country.,because
45156_1,This positivity shows his acceptance.,The positivity will continue to have meaning with hislife.,and
46175_1,A friend of mine watched it on the stream,"He told me to look, thus looking back it now at 4:38 second of this video,",and
42844_3,i like it.,see understand these topics easily.,Nan
43114_3,majority of Christians are white people.,They dont think about terrible things.,and
43187_3,The whole world is enjoying their life.,we should find out about it.,and
45808_2,you havent visited their land or just talked to any 5 Muslims in America to see that that stereotype simply isnt true.,they are very peaceful individuals.,and
46161_1,They were absolutely wonderful.,it was interesting to see their perspective about wearing it.,and
44260_1,It has really opened my eyes.,It made me realize.,and
43298_1,It was tough to follow along at times.,I got the general gist of what Sam was trying to emphasize.,Nan
44004_2,Black people are the only ones that are still oppressed.,Black people are the only ones that are still abused.,and
46091_3,I felt the anger was just gonna eat me from the inside.,It was hurting me more than it was benefiting me.,and
43979_1,Sam is very even-keeled.,Sam  is very open to a multitude of thoughts,and
46326_1,White people today are similar they seem to have majority control.,"They seem to have control over wealth, stuff, they do not want to give up to black people.",and
45650_4,The black people were just dodging their questions.,The black people were turning the question back on the white people.,and
46315_1,This lecture is primary about that.,Which was refreshing.,and
45365_1,I could see how it could be disrespectful for the military/people in the service.,They put their lives on the line every single day.,and
43457_1,"By promoting this disconnection of knowledge/reasoning, we begin to add fuel to the flames.","We educate our children, friends, our families about what we think we know.",and
43165_1,The question arose as to why we all believe the number must be so much higher.,The question arose as to why we all believe the number is less than the number of white Americans killed by police.,and
44394_1,This day of class interested me very much.,I am the daughter of a police officer.,because
44545_3,We took their ancestors lives.,We completely manipulated their population.,and
45446_1,I'm sure it is hard to a president to enact changes.,There are many systems that have to be gone through. ,so
44329_2,There are different races mixed,There are different races blended,and
43959_4,I think is crucial to learn about cultures of countries unlike your own.,I think is crucial to learn about practices of countries unlike your own.,and
45472_1,I enjoyed this class lecture too. ,I was very interested in how Muslim women viewd Eastern clothing. ,because
42785_2,All he could do is try to make a difference.,He educates others.,and
45390_7,Their employers had power,employers had power to control of where their workers went.,and
45704_2,What if that was happening around my neighborhood?,What if it was happening in my community?,and
42780_2,I was shocked that he was willing to talk to us.,He shared his stories in a cam state.,and
43250_2,"During WWII, the ""them"" group were the Germans, who we called monsters.","During WWII, the ""them"" group were the Japanese, who we put into internment camps.",and
45699_1,I used to be so selfish.,I only believed things I knew.,and
44408_2,It is the deep-minded thinking of I am better than you.,i deserve better things than you.,so
45555_3,We made horrible decisions.,They respond saying it was not us.,Nan
43741_3,We can all learn a lot from his reaction.,He was able to see past our military.,so
46110_1,The point of this activity was to make us realize the the racial inequality which black people had faced.,It was less severe.,Nan
46271_5,The major thing that I have learned is that it is  important to have empathy towards people.,It is  extremely important to see things from different perspectives.,and
44477_1,"If i were a black person, I can imagine why they would only want to hang around their kind.",White people are often ignorant.,because
44916_5,the black lives matter movement joined in to protest along side the family.,to show that it affects others well.,so
46219_3,The three people presented in their own rhetoric.,The presentation showed me the BLM movement is a product of history.,so
44289_5,These people have struggled enough.,These people deserve a better quality of life.,and
44086_1,They were specifically avoiding this.,They had just escaped from the monarch.,because
43820_1,He is mighty and great. ,Why does he need people to protect him?,so
42813_2,It just really frustrates me that there are people out there that will look at all police officers and question their intentions.,Few are actually corrupt.,because
45020_4,They should basically just get over it,It happened in the past.,because
44301_6,Some troops from the middle east came to America.,Some troops bombed an American family.,and
44979_1,I'm going to continue working on making an effort to talk to different people.,It is beneficial for both people.,because
43178_1,"Nowadays, religion has become part of almost all peoples life.",Religion has such substantial influence on modern society.,because
43524_1,"They chose a select group of people most easily targeted, gay people.",Many people fall under the other categories stated.,because
46212_1,At first I thought the reversal of roles was strange.,Reading your post it makes me see it more effectively than I first thought. ,and
43081_4,They need aid from people that will help them build their lives how they want to in order for them to be in peace. ,Everyone wants to have normal lives.,and
44384_1,Sam talks about his Ted Talk.,He met Basim through Basims response to the Ted Talk.,and
43336_1,Say we do it.,Apparently our leaders don't always do as they've promised,and
45206_4,He made the black people pretend to be white.,He had the white people pretend to be black.,and
44843_2,We should be taking a greater interest into other countries.,We should be taking interest in how they are living.,because
44926_2,We are able to see past the stereotypes.,We look at people for how they truly are.,and
45459_2,Especially if it sounds like bull crap.,Create your own opinion based on your finding.,and
45543_1,We all seem to be so familiar with the enslavement of Africans., I will omit their history here.,Nan
44392_1,Yet I live in this country.,Almost everyone reading this lives in this country.,and
44215_3,Sam asked the class to imagine if someone came to war here.,Someone wanted our natural gas. ,because
45458_6,"This is very true you must consider crime rates are lower, violent crimes have gone down.","These numbers are lower than they have ever been,  there is all coverage on crime.",so
43023_4,We shouldn't assume that the people killing people in the Middle East aren't Muslims.,We shouldn't assume that the people claiming to be Muslims aren't Muslims.,and
45759_4,They could think about the facts of American History.,They could make it evident that we need to question the white people's tactics.,and
45894_1,He is not fully informed.,He is not aware of the social and racial indifference that are currently present in the world we live in.,Nan
43047_2,War does not discriminate.,War acts swiftly with no remorse.,and
45768_2,The roles of blacks switched.,The roles of whites switched.,and
46442_1,People don't realize how hard life was in the Arabian Peninsula. ,It's very nice to see that Mark was able to see the methods and tools the Bedions used to survive. ,Nan
45095_2,Sam set aside the emotions but kept the facts.,This allowed a logic-based argument to be formed.,Nan
45900_1,I was really glad that I had the opportunity to bring Zack into this class.,I was really glad to help open his eyes to a serious matter in the United States.,and
44548_3,His experience with the foster homes was sad.,His culture had to mix with non-native American culture in terms of his hair getting cut.,because
44837_2,We don't know all the facts.,We don't know all the evidence.,and
43279_5,I feel like it isn't talked about as it deserves to be.,It was the start to racial division in the United States of America.,because
43020_4,Christianity is popular in our country,and therefore would make it seem like all Christians are violent.,because
45074_1,Not all Christians are like this.,One can't say.,so
45770_1,Americans fought in the Revolutionary War.,It was justified.,and
44013_1,He starts talking about ISIS.,They came to Mosul.,and
45226_2,Afghanistan is shown to be a war torn desolate place where you only find an oppressive regime.,Afghanistan is shown to have poverty.,and
44466_2,I always figured a bombing would take careful execution.,This is not the case.,and
44636_1,something is not your culture that you were taught.,That it is wrong,because
45395_1,In the class exercise I have a few white friends.,My white friends teach me about stuff.,and
43441_1,We are quick to pass judgment.,"In reality, we have many similarities.",so
44625_1,People see their idols they grow up with in certain sports.,They are all the same.,Nan
42802_1,The topic that had captured my attention the most this past week was the conversation we had.,The conversation regarded black lives matter.,Nan
45540_2,We can educate them about where the United States has gone wrong in the past.,We can teach them about ways it can be better in the future.,and
43322_1,"Whether we might share many similarities, we are quick to judge others who seem different from us.",We call their ideas weird.,and
44055_5,Even if the white individual has a criminal record.,The white individual would still have a higher chance.,and
45308_1,It was all the same facts involved.,It was just made about white people?,Nan
43818_1,We have associated the Middle East with Muslims.,We have associated Muslims with terrorists.,and
46068_2,Sam said in the video.,White people set things up.,so
43687_3,He mentioned how his religion would want him to forgive. ,He mentioned how his religion would want him to move on. ,and
44706_4,"Being a white person, she was able to recognize that.",I'm sure that most white people can understand that.,and
43687_2,He mentioned how his religion would want him to forgive. ,He mentioned how his religion would want him to move on. ,and
42803_1,He has seen a countless number of crimes.,He has seen a countless number of tragedies.,and
44162_2,Issues are happening in society.,That means looking up information themselves.,and
44976_1,I don't think it should be such a big task to take a few minutes out of our lives.,I don't think it should be such a big task to just talk to people who may have a different perspective than us.,and
44381_2, there are not people who do follow their religion to perfection.,They do things like forgive the unforgivable.,and
45144_2,The women might think they were being mean.,The truth they spoke might be mean.,because
44984_2,I think that should be emphasized more in this day.,I think that should be emphasized more in this age.,and
46197_5,We alone are the only ones who can judge ourselves. ,We hold ourselves to our own standards that we see fit. ,and
45742_1,Sam allows both sides to contribute remarks.,Sam controls the conversation.,and
46385_4,Blacks are peacefully protesting for their basic rights.,whites starting the unnecessary violence.,and
43950_4,Those teachers that preach about life.,"Those teachers more importantly care about you as a human being, not just another number.",and
44323_1,Many people are constantly at risk to be attacked.,Basim helped the class understand.,and
45117_5,There's only one reason people have this image in their head of black people being killed by police officers more often.,There's one reason they think they're discriminated against by police officers.,and
44752_4,He makes us talk about them.,We truly understand.,so
46152_2,I gain wisdom like Bassim.,I reflect on what my religion tells me to do.,and
43812_4,We generalize Christians to be holy.,Why are muslims generalized to be violent?,and
43068_2,They did not.,I cannot blame them.,Nan
44981_1,This is a great response.,you've made some very valid points regarding freedom.,and
45253_1,Switching roles made it more powerful.,It makes it easier to imagine what it would have been like if that happened to me.,because
43710_1,The worst thing is with each new United States president there should be a new hope for the people of Iraq.,This isn't the case.,Nan
44261_2,We are closer than we think.,New technologies are available to bring us together.,because
43388_1,Media outlets have been talking non stop about athletes taking the knee during the national anthem.,News outlets have been talking non stop about athletes taking the knee during the national anthem.,and
46454_4,It is important to ask questions about subjects.,Im not familiar with.,and
46362_3,why are you  talking about it?,A white student respond.,and
43799_1,The United States is not perfect.,Why are we Americans condescending to all of the countries?,so
43381_1,Everyone deserves to be able to live their lives to the fullest,"police brutality, especially directed towards minorities, needs to diminish",so
44126_3,To understand what they feel.,To understand why they feel it. ,and
46273_5,It is frustrating.,The United States was founded by white men.,because
44062_2,It's very important to take the time to understand their issues.,It's very important to see what you can do to help.,and
43376_4,I think it's something a lot of adults tend to forget.,"They don't see others as real people sometimes, primarily in the context of war.",and
45213_1,We were not really great friends at first.,She was extremely shy.,because
45073_1,Sam does make a good point in showing a majority Christian audience.,That there are people of the Christian religion.,Nan
46216_1,In the text.,Sam said that this was not a class to miss.,and
45512_1,White people tend to ignore it.,It doesn't affect them.,because
45023_3,I have realized that there is a significance to what is happening across the world.,It is important to be aware of what is going on.,and
43457_2,"By promoting this disconnection of knowledge/reasoning, we begin to add fuel to the flames.","We educate our children, friends, our families about what we think we know.",and
46094_2,My religion tells me to forgive.,My religion guides me through my life.,and
45994_4,"He is the President, not a late night talk show host.",It's time he acts like it.,and
44920_3,Everyone has the freedom to do whatever they please.,Kaepernick is doing it.,and
43864_3,Often times citizens find themselves not pleased with the president they voted for.,The presidents talked themselves up during campaigns.,and
46291_1,I really noticed how a hijab can frame a woman's face when the non-hijab-wearing woman tried on hijabs.,I really noticed how a hijab can draw attention to her facial features when the non-hijab-wearing woman tried on hijabs.,and
43143_3,His youngest recorded victim was 12,some victims were rumored to be younger,and
44211_1,"All the people like Basim and his family, everyone their lives have been turned completely upside down.",It is that America invaded 16 years ago.,because
45839_2,We must take a step back.,We must understand a different person's perspective.,and
44757_1,I knew that Muslim women don't always wear their hijabs at home.,I didn't know about their immodest clothing styles at home.,Nan
43467_1,Someone lives in a war torn country.,This war is partially the fault of my countries government.,and
42874_1,That is why it is important to not judge the actions of a few Muslims.,They say they are Muslims.,because
46130_1,It is such an interesting deal of the country.,It puts in place that women must wear these clothes.,Nan
43023_1,We know that KKK members aren't Christians.,We shouldn't assume that the people killing people in the Middle East aren't Muslims.,and
46245_2,"Going into this, I felt that I had little knowledge on the topic.",I had many unanswered questions. ,and
45146_3,They are forced to rather than them wanting to,Hearing these women say they wear the clothes they do.,so
46201_2,"They were topics like slavery, racism, and oppressive acts done to African Americans",they feel that these are all instances of the past,because
45902_3,Myself included.,We act as if we do.,and
45067_2,I found this section relatively short.,It was incredibly interesting.,because
44344_4,He stated that his religion teaches him to forgive.,He has almost come to terms with everything.,and
45111_2,It's like the guy in the video said.,The police are supposed to be the good guys.,so
46257_2,it gave me a real look into what it was like to be a black person during those times.,it gave me a real look into what it was like to be a black person today.,and
45360_1,"this fear that Americans experienced just from one act of terrorism, one day of horrible events.", think about the fear Iraqi citizens must go through on a daily basis with Isis having a stronghold in their home territory.,and
44109_3,The news reports what they think we will want to hear.,The news reports what people will react to most.,because
45364_3,These athletes know that there is no better place for them to voice their opinions then on national television.,The whole country can see.,and
44136_1,It's up to us to educate ourselves.,Being in Soc 119 is a good place to start.,and
43665_3,That the media coverage of the Middle East is negative.,That the good in all Muslims is never shown to the average Americans.,and
43811_1,Everyone has their own beliefs.,Everyone has their own opinions.,and
44683_5,I am loving people for the bad., after all thats what makes us human.,and
44151_3,"When we do, there is much talk of improvement and how things will get better",I feel this proves change isn’t easy. ,and
45046_5,It does not matter how hard some people work.,There is the sense of racism.,because
45618_1,"Moreover, he himself know that he can not revenge.",That will only cause more tragedies happen.,because
44103_1,Sams excitement about certain issues definitely stems out to the class.,I think its crazy he he tries hard to reach the issues from many different angles.,and
45831_4,His strength is inspiring.,I hope that he will be able to share his story with more Americans.,and
46069_1,It was hard to believe.,Life after slavery was worse for black people then life before slavery.,and
45142_1,"sam saidBe aware of people,places outside of the United States.",I took it  have an open mind.,and
45298_4,Truly diving in is nearly impossible.,Understanding what exactly you're supposed to be seeing is nearly impossible.,so
43871_1,First off I like how Sam is open minded.,Sam incorporates multiple religions into his life.,and
43361_8, it is hard to see that Christians could be a part of many horrific hate groups.,it is much easier to see people who are Islamic as bad.,so
42779_1,This conversation was an eye-opening experience.,Our country has effects on people.,and
45098_1,I was not taught this when I was younger.,Teachers thought that we were not mature enough.,and
43389_1,Donald Trump has been tweeting about it.,Donald Trump has in some way influenced this.,and
45556_1,"For example, I have a friend who is black.",I have a friend who lives in New York City.,and
44230_1,It is the sheltering for most who have never truly met a Muslim person.,It is the inability for most who have never truly met a Muslim person.,and
45842_3,Seeing the world through someone elses eyes.,I think this stuck out to me the most.,and
46127_1,We always walk by people.,We make judgments.,and
45072_1,We like to think that what we are doing is good.,We like to think that we are fighting the good fight.,Nan
43109_3,they have been negatively affected by ISIS..,Iraqi citizens have no hope of it returning like it once was.,so
44062_1,It's very important to have conversations with people that are different from you.,It's very important to take the time to understand their issues.,and
46507_1,I  selected this video.,it really was a meaningful experience to both the people who participated in the activity.,because
45883_2,They included the concept that the whites had nothing left.,They were basically forced to go back to the blacks for more work.,so
43515_1,He says it is due to fact that we live in a Christian world.,We do not see it that way.,because
44980_3,Don't take everything to heart.,What is the worst thing that can happen?,and
46101_1,As it went on I got really into it. ,I tried my best to imagine it the was Sam wanted us to. ,and
44932_4,I agree with the above comment.,We should stop the cycle.,Nan
43960_4,They didn't change from last week., Ill give it a shot anyway.,Nan
44712_2,He did not blame anyone for this.,He blamed the American government. ,and
46188_3,The black lives matter movement helped a white man's family.,He had been murdered by the police.,and
46361_3,We had black people be superior on top.,It was kind of odd to me.,and
46478_1,Both ways of life are cool. ,There are benefits to both. ,and
43176_1,Religion can be powerful.,Imagine a group of people decided to interpret the meanings.,and
45355_1,"The 9 11 attacks, not only took the lives of 3,000 American citizens, injuring 6,000 more.",Osama Bin Laden took credit for.,and
42871_3,We live in a bubble. ,We don’t truly understand what we are. ,and
42845_1,I have felt a great amount of empathy towards people of other cultures lately.,I never took the time to step out of my shoes.,because
46461_4,Female breasts are more sexualized than male breasts.,Female breasts need to be covered.,and
46144_1,A lot has happened throughout history.,This violence of white people against black people is a reason.,Nan
45619_1,Why not let it go. ,It will make him feel relief. ,so
44270_1,We are taught to forgive and love everyone.,It is unfair that we treat a specific group that way.,and
45722_1,Im not goanna lie.,A couple times during this exercise I thought to myself wow white people really suck for what they did to people of color.,Nan
43091_1,We need to realize.,"People on the other side of the world are not as different from us, like we may believe.",Nan
42820_2,Something baffles me.,It baffles me to watch the news.,and
42852_2,The people who lived there had minimal rights.,They never left their little huts.,and
46367_5,I hope that many people don't just look past those photos.,how long ago did it happened?,because
43577_1,Some people I know try to say those hate groups are formed due to jealousy of the United States.,I believe it is more due to the many innocent civilians we have accidentally killed in the Middle East.,so
45366_1,What many people dont know though is that there are some athletes that talk directly to people in the service.,They do not want to minimalize all of the militarys efforts.,because
46294_1,I have a pretty noticeable scar on the inside of my right elbow. ,I am proud of that scar.,and
43992_2,Little attention was paid to it.,They tried to pay him a small price to make up for what they had done.,and
45355_3,Osama Bin Laden took credit for.,Al-Qaeda took credit for.,and
43591_2,Basim is empathatic. ,Basim is forgiving. ,and
43929_1,It is imperative that we have conversations about these issues.,We need to come closer to ending the inequalities that we have.,and
44702_2,"If I were black, I would want the world to learn about my specific racial groups history.",It was intense.,because
43618_1,If everyone looked at things with an open mind there would be less controversy.,If everyone looked at things from a different view there would be less controversy.,and
44711_2,I thought he would be blaming all Americans for the loss of his wife.,I thought he would be blaming all Americans for the loss of his relatives.,and
44414_2,You realize that religion is part of who you are.,Religion does not define us as human beings. ,and
43261_2,I was expecting a larger number.,I think that it stems from the media fixating on one thing.,and
43480_2,They taught the same thing.,I am Christian.,and
44208_3,it made me realize how lucky we are to live in a country where our well-being isnt threatened everyday.,It made me realize how the United States is responsible for the conflict in Iraq.,and
44447_4,A police pulls them over.,All the events has happened.,because
44623_1,There is a myth that black people are better at basketball.,Naturally it doesn't even make sense.,because
43767_1,"Overall, Basim should be something we all strive to be during times of crisis.",we should look forwards and at the good in our lives that we have.,Nan
45499_1,It has evolved into a system.,it thrives off of entertainment and money-making.,Nan
ID_4,Sub-Sentence 4,Sub-Sentence 5,Nan
45871_1,Another slide that Sam showed us was from the National Survey of Drug Use.,"Health, which indicated that black people statistically sold more drugs than white people.",and
46422_1,I was able to learn about her culture.,I was able to learn about the rules.,and
45445_1,The comments made by Trump are disturbing.,Trump's supporters will continue to have his back.,Nan
46309_2,You think the civil war was a step forward.,Slavery was stopped.,because
43683_1,I found this moment very powerful.,This man is able to forgive Americans for what happened to his family.,because
45591_1,I thought it was quite appropriate.,It definitely got peoples attention,and
44927_2,I left that lecture feeling very complicit in the acts against all the many families like him.,It was done by our country.,and
44076_3,The other half believes something else.,One side is going to be unhappy with the result.,and
44204_2,They would not Hell according to the quote.,Most of class was not able to raise their hands.,Nan
43766_1,Hearing him say that being angry was killing him was so meaningful.,It speaks a lot to many religions that focus more on forgiveness than cruelty.,and
42935_2,he lived within America.,He met so many people that became his close friends including Sam.,and
42953_1,This class has helped me become more aware.,This class has made me curious to do extra research about what is going on around me.,and
42791_4,Problems outside of the United States have never been such a constant reminder in our lives. ,It is only natural for us to easily forget. ,because
44653_3,It is important to let people feel comfortable.,No matter what they decide to step out in.,and
46209_1,I can definitely see why people are getting offended with the kneeling controversy.,I am thinking that it is absolutely ridiculous that people are blowing it  out of proportion.,so
45016_1,It is eye opening to see how black people see the amount of ignorance some white people have.,There is ignorance when white people talk about slavery.,Nan
42988_1,"From the outside, they imagine criminals crossing the border.","From the outside, they imagine criminals taking jobs.",and
44961_3,I found the class interesting. ,I heard how ridiculous some of the arguments from whites are. ,so
42843_1,These people live in a different country.,It does not mean they should be in need.,because
45770_3,It was justified.,It was one of the greatest things to happen.,and
44746_1,Things are much simpler than they were years ago.,We don't use it to our advantage.,so
44629_3,It is hard to feel so confused about it.,Religion is supposed to be something sacred.,because
43320_1,I think we tend to think this way towards the Sharia.,at first glance it doesn't seem to be similar to our way of life.,because
44611_4,He looked more similar to them.,Despite not being of the same origins.,because
45448_1,We see Trump want to put an end to Obamacare.,He wants to end DACA.,and
46333_1,I definitely see the value in exploring new places.,I see the value in getting to know strangers.,and
45314_3,It was our ancestors.,The video is interesting.,Nan
44494_2,He trusted his faith.,It helped him move on.,and
44212_6,These are Aermicans.,This is our government.,because
44822_1,He could learn to forgive.,He could learn not to be judgmental.,and
45414_1,It is particularly a difficult situation in the USA.,Most people here are Christians.,and
44590_2,Sam pointed out.,If this was the other way around I know it would be out of ignorance.,because
45966_1,we can really come together.,"get other races to believe , to  join us.",and
44292_1,The average American thinks we significantly helped the Middle East.,They think we made everything much better.,and
43251_1,I do not think that patriotism is a bad thing. ,I do not think that nationalism is a bad thing. ,and
46120_1,I don't remember the specifics of the class.,I remember the way I felt.,Nan
45946_4,It is because of some heinous acts commetted by cops.,It is because of some heinous acts committed against cops.,and
43957_1,The world outside of the media is so much more.,There is so much more going on than what we might see covered.,and
43607_1,Soc 119 is helping us do this.,Soc 119 is getting us to understand different perspectives.,Nan
42900_2,Basim is a real person who along with his son has experienced an utter tragedy.,"His family members were normal, innocent lives that were lost at an avoidable error our country caused.",and
43020_1,Professor Richards brought up another good point.,People here talk about Muslims killing Muslims.,Nan
45604_4,Finding out that wearing the hijab was actually a choice was actually kind of a surprise for me.,Finding out that all the Muslim women who wear hijab do it because they chose to do so was actually kind of a surprise for me.,and
43782_1,i like it,it make feel good.,Nan
44118_2,"Not being able to discuss religion, at a younger age especially makes us ignorant.",It makes us naive to those around us.,and
43555_3,It is so easy to be informed.,Things are going on around us.,Nan
44553_6,I wish they at least took into consideration families like Basom's.,"Like you said, these are real people's lives at stake.",and
46308_1,It makes sense to imagine.,Sometime later black people would go back to work at the plantations owned by whites.,Nan
45950_1,"For example, a white kid probably never would have felt comfortable taking on the roll of a slave owner.",A white kid probably never would have felt comfortable saying something.,and
44194_2,A few years ago they had people start saying happy holidays instead of Merry Christmas.,Happy holidays includes everyone.,because
44752_2,It's in a good way.,He makes us talk about them.,and
44761_1,Do younger Muslim women have a more tolerant perception on our female clothing?,THe influence of the 21st century.,because
46344_1,"The reality however, is that often people would lie about the crime.",Even go as far as to paint their faces and commit crimes themselves in order to pin it on someone else.,so
43625_1,I moved to the US in pursuit of a better education.,I was able to have access to that.,and
43169_2,You are tired of seeing the videos.,"Your black brothers and sisters profiled, attacked, and killed by police and racial injustice.",Nan
46479_5,She did not have to care about her hair.,that she could just see the world without worrying what she looked like.,and
46006_1,I thought it was interesting.,I saw the two competing perspectives in a different way than usual.,so
45488_7,the white girl said but what specifically are you proud of.,Her response shocked me as I realized there was no great answer.,Nan
45227_3,It is our responsibility to find out what is happening out there on our own.,It is our responsibility to develop our own stances.,and
44909_3,It baffles me how people claim themselves as Christians.,They think it is fine to discriminate.,and
46273_6,The United States was founded by white men., it has been structured ever since it's discovery to keep white men in power.,and
44706_2,History repeats itself.,"Being a white person, she was able to recognize that.",and
42844_4,see understand these topics easily.,see understand these topics easily.,Nan
44368_2,labels get thrown around.,Sometimes there is not a lot of attention to how powerful they can be,and
43439_1,"If he remained angry, he would not have been able tell his story to educate others.",He would not have been able to help to prevent this for others in the future.,and
43406_1,"We are quick to call Muslims or those from Iraq bombers,terrorists.","In reality, we terrorize their people as well.",so
46273_4,It is frustrating.,The United States was founded by white men.,and
44386_1,I feel guilty.,I often support the government that took Basims world from him..,because
45727_1,He said.,He had a lot of anger built up inside of him.,Nan
46261_2, The people who created slavery never owned up for their wrong doings., The people who created the Jim Crow laws never owned up for their wrong doings.,and
44793_1,I have never heard of an exercise like this before,It was uncomfortable.,so
46199_4,It is like a Christian with a cross necklace.,Nobody is forced to wear those things except the hijab.,and
45456_3,"I can't remember the actual stats, or who conducted it.",I do remember it was EXTREMELY fast.,and
43772_1,it make feel good.,i like good.,Nan
45909_1,Sam wanted the non-hijab wearing girls to understand.,Sam wanted a female perspective's questions of what a hijab can signify to them.,and
43957_3,There is so much more going on than what we might see covered.,it is only up to us to find those stories.,and
46273_3,It is hard.,It is frustrating.,because
46048_1,He is really portraying a good person.,He is being the definition of a good person.,and
45824_2,One of the students said something.,She feels the women wearing Hijab should feel more empowered due to it.,because
43372_1,He said that he forgives.,That is what his religion tells him to do.,because
44604_1,That's what I thought for the most part.,Numbers displayed differently in 2016.,Nan
43361_7, it is hard to see that Christians could be a part of many horrific hate groups.,it is much easier to see people who are Islamic as bad.,so
42981_1,the truth is we don't know what people are doing.,It is right here.,and
44358_1,"This is harder to do on the other side, in terms of Muslim practitioners.",They are an incredibly small percentage in the United States.,because
43243_3,"Like I said, women are oppressed everywhere.",It's not just Muslim women.,and
45193_4,There are people who blindly follow without finding out the truth for themselves.,and making their own assessment of everything.,and
45512_3,It doesn't affect them.,"To me, that is sickening.",because
43674_4,Their lives are filled with the worst rage.,Their lives are filled with pain.,and
43777_4,They think we are their enemies. ,They think we have somehow wronged them. ,and
46147_1, was angryn a few months.,I felt the anger was just gonna eat me from the inside.,and
44728_6,Anger doesn't solve anything., that was a sentiment I fully agree with.,because
43688_2,This was a strong reminder about him being a Muslim.,He should forgive.,because
43114_1,It makes sense.,majority of Christians are white people.,because
45528_1,They kneel for more than racism.,thats something that I can respect.,and
43766_3,It speaks a lot to many religions that focus more on forgiveness than cruelty.,It speaks a lot to many religions that focus more on forgiveness than revenge.,and
44253_2,He has taught himself to forgive.,He is a Muslim.,because
45707_3,White people imposed horrors on slaves.,Reversing roles made the horrors imposed on slaves feel more personal.,and
46025_1,I think it is hard for these people.,They are involved in this activity.,because
44783_1,"Because of his exposure to America, he already had relationships with Americans.",He even went school in America.,and
44090_1,Corruption in their country has not been solved.,Revenues that are supposed to be going to the people are going into the pockets of the politicians.,and
46477_4,Sam asked them what they think about each other opinion wise., It was absolutely amazing to hear that neither group judged each other.,and
45685_1,I think that was also proven.,This exercise proves it.,Nan
44272_1,This makes us a nation seem very ignorant.,distant to other nations.,and
46083_2,They chose to give them nothing.,Reconstruction took place during this time.,so
44266_1,They have only been shown those we fight.,It has hurt our view of them as people entirely.,and
45006_2,I believe these players have the ability to use other media outlets.,Players can really go into detail to try to tell people that changes need to be made.,Nan
45421_4,it is the white people who feel oppressed,The black people who are deemed racist and in a position of higher power,and
45316_1,People are grouped in  like oppressive.,other people of that same race did.,because
44299_2,The American soldiers did not intentionally cause harm to Basims people.,That doesnt change what happened.,Nan
45281_1,It's things like that.,Racism is most evident.,and
46242_1,Traveling is an amazing way to learn more about different people.,Getting to know people that follow a specific religion is an amazing way to learn more about different people.,and
45832_2,These athletes are doing it peacefully.,It shouldn't bother anyone.,and
44063_5,I was never really taught about it.,I never really was taught to care much about it.,and
45690_1,In 2017 we are having conversation about roles being reversed.,By 2050 the majority of this country will be mixed race.,because
44189_3,That seems to be the only reason a Muslim would do something terrible.,"They do terrible things because of their religion, not their distorted views. ",and
44870_2,People are  just uneducated.,People are simply naive.,and
43031_1,The players simply want to bring awareness to Americans.,There is a racial divide in America.,and
44038_5,it was done by a group of Muslims., the media did what they do best which is to generalize. ,because
45884_2,"The white people in history were always the ones on top,",Sam said.,and
44008_1,Brena said.,We see more black people getting shot.,and
42928_3,I never thought of any religion as mine.,I had an open mind.,so
45504_1,Sam did a great job at orchestrating this discussion.,It opened the eyes of many individuals.,because
45256_2,They do not fully understand the spectrum of it.,They do not understand the long period of time that black people had to endure being treated the way they were.,because
43947_1,Bassim told us his story about how a few years ago bomb destroyed his home.,It killed most of his family due to the US military's miscalculation.,because
45458_5,"This is very true you must consider crime rates are lower, violent crimes have gone down.","These numbers are lower than they have ever been,  there is all coverage on crime.",so

43850_2,Choosing to do the protest at this place is unfair to the audience.,The audience is a captive.,and
45291_3,I think some of the points got lost in translation.,I was a white person sitting in the classroom.,because
44197_1,It is easy for us to hear things in the news.,It is easy to be unaffected by it.,and
45699_4,I only perceived based off what I knew.,I believed things based off what my family knew.,and
45231_2,It is a core detriment to we Americans as a people.,Imagine if we do not open up our minds to the things throughout the world.,Nan

46229_6, its unfair that its required to wear them .,Its something I have thought about myself.,and
44188_1,I think it’s due to Christianity being the norm in the US. ,It’s what the majority of the country practices. ,and
45423_1,We heard one thing from Sam.,The idea struck me the most.,Nan

45784_1,Hearing someone open their heart tell their story about racism helps.,"Hearing stories of racism, cruelty towards humans, that will help.",and
44063_2,I feel the same way sometimes.,I was never really taught about it.,because
44926_4,We look at people for how they truly are.,We look not how they are thought of to be.,and
45948_2,It allowed people to open up more.,It allowed more honest past mindsets to shine through.,and
43378_1,"Karly, I completely agree.",With everything you've said.,Nan

45918_1,People are outside.,They actually see what is going on.,Nan
43887_1,They cannot do that.,They need to talk.,and
45697_4,Basim's story about forgiving runs in my head.,"Basim can forgive, I should too.",and

44893_3,Sam was talking about divorce.,People turn to the Bible in order to handle the aspects of divorce.,and
44668_2,Slavery happened a long time ago. ,We don’t have slaves anymore. ,because

43465_2,I hope change happens to protect all innocent people.,No matter what country they are from.,and
45768_3,The roles of whites switched.,I realized how wicked our world is.,and
44620_5,"Back before our modern technology colleges could only go to areas to search for recruits and players, that would end up becoming professionals.", in regions where you could naturally play the game associated with it.,so

43905_1,The media is a factor.,It influences stupid people easily.,because

45271_2,I think it made a lot of people think about their religion.,It opened up their eyes to the fact that it is not just Muslims fighting Muslims.,and
45256_1,A lot of people do not fully support the black people movement.,They do not fully understand the spectrum of it.,because
43268_3,Why do some people continue to assume a certain thing?,Why do some people continue to assume something about any Muslim individual?,Nan
43632_2,The media does not want to show world events.,The American people are not interested.,because
44663_1,I thought it was cool.,He flipped all the statistics around.,Nan
46022_4,The natural disasters happen in other countries.,The focus of the media attracts a bigger audience.,because
44751_1,I like that Sam talks about issues that are happening today.,I think too often its easy to just shut off the news.,because
46033_1,I personally have never been to the Middle East.,I found it unbelievably fascinating.,so
44172_4,The people in it are fearful.,Fear leads to hate.,and
45070_1,We are meant to believe that what we are doing in the MIddle East is helping.,We believe it is necessary for us to be there.,and
45048_1,This is a way for many to have a sense of the world. ,It’s a different perspective. ,Nan
44303_2,I would barely be able to control myself.,I would barely be able to control my anger.,and
43771_1,I found this statement interesting.,"here in the United States when someone else becomes President, their polices are different from the previous President.",because
46092_1,Anger has the power to control your life in such a negative aspect.,no positive change can come from anger.,and
45679_3,The message was loud.,The message was clear.,and
45625_1,I feel like a lot of the divide our nation has over racism is purely due to ignorance.,It is not out of malice.,so
43741_6,He was able to see past our military.,Every American was not responsible for what happened to his family.,because
43637_2,"Therefore, it is of the upmost importance that Americans learn more about other people , through our media.","Therefore, it is of the upmost importance that Americans learn more about other people through our education system.",and
43747_2,We can learn many things from the international students.,We truly broaden our view on the world.,and
44981_2,you've made some very valid points regarding freedom.,he right to be able to believe in whatever you want.,and
45512_2,It doesn't affect them.,"To me, that is sickening.",and
44668_3,Slavery happened a long time ago. ,We don’t have slaves anymore. ,so
43062_3,Sadam was executed.,It was a celebration day for my family.,and
44645_4,That statement should not be said because I know that their history goes back to slavery.,"There are people who still see black people as less than a person than white people, which is completely absurd. ",and
45640_3,In my personal opinions it is disgusting.,I can't believe this is not talked about more often.,and
44796_2,It was terribly harsh treatment of people.,We learned about it in school.,and
43914_1,It's so easy to forget.,There are people suffering like this overseas.,and
45281_3,It actually largely .reminds me of some other things,They happen in the world.,Nan
44607_1,I chose the topic of how have the US presidents changed., I thought i might hear an emphatic answer.,because
42977_1,Sam discusses islamophobia.,Sam discusses all this talk about Muslims killing each other.,and
44573_1,It is disturbing.,I recognize how influential the media is in our society.,Nan
45490_5,Weeding out those with bias is often hard.,its such an inherent and subconscious phenomenon that is hard to set qualifications for.,because
46251_3,It is unpredictable how many people have lost their life.,It is unpredictable how many homes have been lost.,and
43200_2,Legally armed minorities are targeted.,Minorities look a certain way.,because
46383_1,This discussion the data from Sam gave me better insight.,I feel that I have a better understanding to how my ancestors grew up.,and
43912_1,I honestly couldnt think of one question to ask him.,I was absolutely speechless.,because
45303_3,The arguments that were brought up were common points.,We have heard them everywhere.,and
45205_3,Any race could have ended up on top.,Any race would have had the same advantages today.,and
45662_2,It really opened my eyes to the truth.,It was not what the media wants us to think.,and
44379_2,I agree about how impressive it is that he was able to move on.,I agree how impressive it is that he was able to forgive the people who hurt him.,and
45493_2,They are required to have a high school diploma.,Pass a series of physical and mental tests.,and
44008_3,We see more black people getting shot.,We see more black people getting abused against on the internet and media.,and
44558_3,We let other people rule our judgements.,We are being ignorant.,and
45746_2,Racism exists today.,Blacks are forced to fight its beliefs.,and
46107_1,I  liked how the old pictures (of the white slaves picking cotton)used to reinforce this idea.,The wealthy black businessmen in New York City that started the slave trade.,and
46304_1,"The less time we spend judging one another, the more time we have to build relationships. ",That’s important! ,and
43825_1,it make feel good,i like it,and
44795_3,Sam described the treatment of the whites was mind boggling.,It was seeing another side of the story,and
44715_2,He wasnt angrier than he was.,He explained to us.,Nan
44994_3,People are unable to put themselves in the shoes of others.,People are unable to think about what they are feeling.,because
45956_3,it gave the race that was silenced for so long a chance to hold the upper hand in a conversation,we have white people hear them say things that sound insane to us,because
46296_1,"Like the one girl said, wearing a hijab means that you're not worried  much about yourself.",You're able to look out into the world without much worry.,so
42804_1,He wants to help people.,He has done a lot of good.,and
44807_2,It all does seem extreme to me.,It doesn't bother me.,and
44764_5,It made them more comfortable.,They feel less under the judgmental eyes of people.,and
44869_1,Those black students were up there representing me.,They were representing people I know.,and
43481_4,That shows different cultures.,That shows different religions that I know nothing about. ,and
44796_1,I empathize with people who were slaves.,It was terribly harsh treatment of people.,and
42908_1,These men caused damage to America.,They caused a lot of pain.,and
44102_3,Like we’ve been going over international relations for quite a while in this class. ,It is definitely just a reflection of how important these issues are. ,and
45520_7,Some people think that it is talked about too much.,others think not enough.,and
44413_3,There are Muslims who use their religion for hate.,There are Christians who do this too.,and
43981_1,I understand it is important for people to have their beliefs.,I understand it is important for people to have their values.,and
44109_2,The news reports what they think we will want to hear.,The news reports what people will react to most.,and
43308_2,very like, yes we talked.,Nan
45071_1,"At the end of the video, Basim states that corruption within the government of Iraq is probably the most detrimental thing. ",Bassim states that it is probably the biggest problem for the Iraqi people. ,and
42988_2,"From the outside, they imagine criminals taking jobs.","From the outside, they imagine criminals taking resources that belong to us.",and
45458_1,"This is very true you must consider crime rates are lower, violent crimes have gone down.","These numbers are lower than they have ever been,  there is all coverage on crime.",and
44103_3,I think its crazy he he tries hard to reach the issues from many different angles.,His lecture covers almost covers every single angle.,and
44404_1,Follow the law.,Don't do anything wrong regardless of your race.,and
45197_2,Columbus came to this new world.,There were already people here.,and
43490_1,It is unfortunate to think about innocent people like Basim struggling.,There is way on their homeland.,because
44315_1,They have been fighting for many generations.,It is sad.,and
43112_2,we need to find a way to express our thought.,we need to fight for the things that you deserve like equality for black racial group.,and
44060_2,To have empathy you have to put yourself in someone else's shoes.,To have empathy you have to deeply try to feel what they're going through.,and
43250_3,"During WWII, the ""them"" group were the Germans, who we called monsters.","During WWII, the ""them"" group were the Japanese, who we put into internment camps.",and
42871_5,We live in a bubble. ,We don’t truly understand what we are. ,because
46465_1,I knew Muslim women had the privilege of dressing.,Like this in front of their husbands.,Nan
44491_1,I do not think I would have the courage.,I do not think I would have the strength.,and
43955_2,Basim encouraged us to try and learn on our own about the world.,Basim encouraged us not to base that knowledge on what the media says.,and
45377_4,It is never seen as disrespectful,It is never shunned on national news.,and
46452_2,They only wear their hijabs for unfamiliar men.,They only cover their skin for going outside.,and
46268_1,I kept thinking everything the white black people were saying was very conceited.,I kept thinking everything the white black people were saying was very rude.,and
42965_2,i like my life.,i like my life.,because
45609_2,I hear things on the news about invasions.,I don't really get the full effect of what is happening.,and
44205_1,It is easy for someone who does not believe in homosexuality to take use part of the Bible to fuel their justification.,They are against homosexuality.,and
43975_1,It cannot be just one person that is shocked by something as realistic as this.,I bet many of you in this class were stunned by his thought as well.,and
46160_3,"It was our personality, traits, characteristics, or even actions.",It was really awesome seeing the experiment Sam did.,Nan
42822_2,Christians can interpret the Bible differently.,Muslims can interpret the Quran differently.,and
44081_1,This really made me think about the past elections. ,Especially how politicians will say whatever they need to say to get elected. ,and
45418_6,Basim should be someone that everyone aspires to be.,his values are so strong where he is only coping so that he can be there for his son and not look at the negativity in life.,because
46443_1,Going through these journeys opens up your mind to new ideas.,Mark said it's not the physical aspect that is hard.,and
43534_4,I am pretty sure it is the lack of education.,It is the lack of awareness.,and
45647_2,I found it very interesting to hear their opinion.,White people are behind in society.,because
46060_1,"When you see something like this, no matter the victim, it should annoy you.",They are doing the exact opposite of what they are meant to be doing.,because
45047_8,There was an in class demonstration.,more people will take something from that rather than just reading an article.,and
44977_4,I always want to be hearing different opinions.,I just stay set in my own ways.,because
45973_2,This put them into more dangerous position.,They had to sign a contract.,because
46213_2,Your possibility for employment should be based on your social skills.,"Your possibility for employment should be based on your level of professionalism, NOT your skin color, or your name!",and
44117_1,There are many differences.,There is value in believing in a higher power.,Nan
45810_1,Actually seeing the screenshots from slave history will stick in a lot of peoples heads.,It will hopefully make something click.,and
44916_3,A white person wasn't given justice. ,the black lives matter movement joined in to protest along side the family.,and
44377_3,Nothing has changed,Something has to happen in order to help these people.,so
43186_1,Any foreign student at the school can be a teacher in our class.,It would allow us to be more knowledgeable of what is happening outside this country.,and
43531_1,We never discuss very serious issues.,I personally think it is because people are afraid of the truth,and
42911_1,As a generation we have a duty to stop generalizing a people. ,We can live in peace.,so
45455_4,This class kind of showed.,How that is through the statistics on police brutality. ,and
44209_4,"We broke down a society, military, and education.",everything was dismantled.,Nan
42794_1,We need to not be so focused with our personal needs.,We need to be more aware of our ambitions so it does not affect the cost of others.,and
44482_1,Written by a part of the country who lost the civil war.,Obviously they aren't going to make them look bad.,so
43377_3,You are forced to view others as people that love their families just like you do.,It is a lot easier to practice treat others as you want to be treated.,and
43170_3,Seeing them attacked at all.,Particularly without any repercussions from their assailant. ,and
42974_2,There are so many issues that need to be discussed.,They need to be brought to the surface for us.,and
45380_5,There are better ways to show your opinions.,There are more appropriate ways to show your opinions.,and
46374_1,The first thing was made pretty clear to me.,We overlook black history.,and
44398_1,The internet is constantly showing videos of black people.,The internet is constantly showing videos of cops.,and
42819_2,I may judge other religions.,I may judge other countries.,and
42831_1,I thought it was very interesting.,I never thought about how this class changes.,because
44551_2,it made me realize how many other families had to go through the same thing.,It is so unfair and cruel. ,and
43333_1,I myself am guilty of instantly disliking someone.,they've identified as a trump supporter.,because
44532_1,We must try to understand each other..,We must try to accept each other for our differences.,Nan
46450_1,This particular comment is interesting.,I automatically would've assumed.,because
46280_2,Racism is more systematically assembled in the world that I live in today.,It is still holding people of color back.,and
45110_3,An officer beat him for no reason.,The reporter said that the officer did nothing wrong.,and
43568_1,It was very personable.,It helped give people more of a sense of what is going on around us.,and
45791_4,Anyone reported to have any privilege were tortured.,or shot to death.,Nan
46313_1,These traits allow others to understand.,These traits help others understand who a person is.,and
44063_1,I feel the same way sometimes.,I was never really taught about it.,and
44258_1,We don't get enough teachings on geography.,A lot of people don't know what's going on in certain countries.,so
46506_1,I waited for the new videos.,I have been attentive to the past two week's discussions.,because
45026_3,He simply allows himself to be human.,He allows his students to be human.,because
44102_2,Like we’ve been going over international issues.,Like we’ve been going over international relations for quite a while in this class. ,and
43906_2,Christians tend to be hateful more often than Muslims are,Christians aren't going to hate on themselves.,and
45352_1,We see.,They want us to see.,so
44715_3,He explained to us.,There was no reason for him to stay angry.,because
46426_3,I saw a positive outlook on the significance of wearing the hijab.,I never got that from my past experience with my roommate last year.,and
44692_1,"I think, when it comes to the image created about religions it is important, not to feel guilty about being a part of it.","I think, when it comes to the image created about those who follow them, it is important, not to feel guilty about being a part of it.",and
45081_1,"By Christians putting themselves in Muslims shoes, people are able to open there minds up to a more complex thinking.","By Muslims putting themselves in Christians shoes, people are able to open their minds up to new opinions.",and
45164_2,I found out that Christians used to wear head coverings.,It's due to scripture 1 Corinthians 11:5.,because
44820_2,There are just many wrong things in this situation.,Basim chooses to turn the other cheek.,so
45135_1,There is human nature of competition.,There is human nature of collectivization.,and
43229_2,He has said.,Gotten away with copious offensive statements.,and
44192_2,There are many religions here.,We cannot pick one.,and
42799_3,There was nothing to be done about it.,It was due to the intense fear they installed in the people around them,because
43268_1,Why do some people do a certain thing?,Why do some people continue to assume a certain thing?,so
44361_2,Radical Muslims will do horrible things.,They end up making the headlines.,and
45662_1,This was one of my favorite classes.,It really opened my eyes to the truth.,because
45455_1,I feel like our generation doesn't second guess anything.,This class kind of showed.,and
43846_2,What we can do is educate ourselves.,We listen.,and
45190_1,People need to assess things.,People put their own bias in the picture.,Nan
44003_3,We hear what people are talking about. ,Black people are the main target of policemen.,and
44685_2,You said that it does not define us.,I could not agree more about that.,and
45007_3,I know that players have the ability to make a difference.,They make people angry.,and
44286_1,I too was incredibly intrigued.,Bassim was saying.,Nan
44620_4,In northern regions you see a lot of hockey arenas because it is so cold.,"Back before our modern technology colleges could only go to areas to search for recruits and players, that would end up becoming professionals.",so
43543_1,We have to stay strong to what we believe.,We have to be open to listening to what others have to say.,and
45706_2,We found it difficult to comprehend the role reversal at first,in the end it definitely was an enlightening way to look at our history.,and
46316_1,Being able to see someone elses viewpoint and perspective allows you to grow as a person.,Being able to see someone elses viewpoint help you form your own opinions on what you think is right.,and
43432_2,The first step is to try and understand.,The next step then is to share different viewpoints of our cultures and religions.,Nan
46503_1,I guess.,We all view it in a context lens.,Nan
45117_4,It seemed like the entire class was pretty shocked to see these statistics.,There's only one reason people have this image in their head of black people being killed by police officers more often.,and
43663_4,We make ourselves feel better by saying they really aren't Christians.,Christians  would never kill.,because
46154_1,"If everyone used their strength to forgive, we could strive to find better understanding.",We can improve our society. ,and
44207_2,It was their life.,It was their property.,Nan
42965_1,i like my life.,i like my life.,Nan
44735_3,Sam began talking about how Africans simply used their resources/wit to travel up through Europe.,They captured slaves who propelled the Africans' development.,and
46188_6,It shows that this movement is to create a system where EVERYONE is equal.,police do not get to take advantage of their position by harming unarmed individuals.,and
43287_3,The only time we ever even consider exploring other topics.,We have something like extra credit assignments.,and
45699_6,I believed things based off what my family knew.,and friends knew believed.,and
44880_1,It is hard at times to convince a white person that these problems and this discrimination exists.,Black people started funding and conducting research to be able to provide further evidence to prove their claims.,so
43603_1,I pray for people who share the same situation as Basim.,I personally do not know if I could continue to live if most of my family were to die how Basims family died.,because
43569_4,He had to go through.,So many people in Mosul had to go through.,and
45794_3,We begin to feel guilty about who we are.,We use this horrid word again.,and
46144_2,This violence of white people against black people is a reason.,I believe there is so much racial tension today.,Nan
45054_1,I'm glad.,This class has enabled me to see issues like race in a different light than I was ever able to before.,Nan
44198_5,I had never seen a subsequent Mosul pic.,It opened my eyes.,and
44793_3,It was uncomfortable.,It was hard to follow.,so
42853_3,"In England, many people were aware of what was occurring in the Middle East. ",Not many Americans had a comprehensive idea.,because
43460_2,To me it seems like the reason he isnt angry all the time is because he has his faith.,He turns to his religion for guidance.,and
44453_1,"To prevent these accidents, we need to talk about them.",We will know what needs to be done for them not to happen again.,so
44956_6,"Sitting in discussion, I understood why many chose not to.",I felt the same with November 7th growing near.,so
45877_3,This would allow more people to get along.,This would change the stigmas that so many of us have for people.,and
46011_2,Nothing becomes an actual problem.,It affects the group that is doing the oppressing.,and
42960_2,He was able to take facing a horrific experience.,"He came out on top, optimistic.",and
44179_4,A foreign government killed your loved ones.,A foreign government destroyed your life.,and
43159_4,Crazies who use it to excuse violence.,Crazies who use it to excuse oppression of others.,and
44111_1,We can be informed on what is going on in our own country.,There is no way we can be informed on what is going on in the rest of the world.,Nan
46287_1,I found the segment when the non-hijab-wearing women tried on hijabs particularly eye-opening.,it made me understand what it means to wear a hijab so much better.,because
45667_1,As a white person you could hear these facts that were presented.,It might not register to you.,and
44461_4,"A lot of women, wearing the Hijab is not a choice.","Especially, one was to travel to a country like Iraq.",because
43128_1,"I think blindly worshiping something (like a flag) without questioning the status quo, is actually dangerous.","It is very dictator-like, should someone say you should not.",so
44772_1,"No matter what happens, white people will not do anything.",They do not have to.,because
43952_2,Many people have a lot of misconceptions about other countries.,Many people have a lot of misconceptions about other cultures.,and
45421_1,Say we reverse history.,it is the white people who feel oppressed,and
43995_5,We should see them like the families they are.,That is how we will move away from stereotyping.,and
44400_2,Some police officers are quick to judge which is wrong.,I also think calling police officers killing black people a genocide is extremely embellished.,and
45227_2,It is our responsibility to find out what is happening out there on our own.,It is our responsibility to develop our own stances.,and
46361_5,It was kind of odd to me.,I listened to them.,and
44104_3,This more complex way has personally hit me hard.,I looked at a person like myself (an African American at Penn State) from the shoes of someone across the world.,Nan
45274_4,People of your own color are associated with representing demeaning circumstances.,"They are things like poverty, riots, drug deals, and segregation.",and
43979_2,Sam  is very open to a multitude of thoughts,"when he said his tolerance was being tested, I began to realize that mine was being tested as well.",and
43586_1,You could tell it fit a lot of his family.,it was a very personable picture.,and
45821_4,They took pride in their beliefs.,It is something to be admired.,and
46385_1,I loved.,"In your response, you recalled.",Nan
45289_1,Undoubtedly the cost of war outweighs the benefits gained by the winning side.,"If we could fully realize the damages of war, would we ever go to war in the first place?",so
43812_1,We generalize Christians to be innocent.,We generalize Christians to be holy.,and
45025_3,Ideas discussed in a class about race are inclined to vary each semester.,Ideas discussed in a class about ethnic relations are inclined to vary each semester.,and
45018_2,It added a little humor.,It also showed how black people truly feel about the topic.,and
43730_1,The main point of his visit was to inform us about the laws.,The main point of his visit was to dispel any stereotypes that many people might think the law system is really like.,and
43930_1,Charlottesville is a clear example of a time.,"A dialogue about race needed to happen, but didnt.",Nan
45042_5,I think this was a very good idea  Sam to flip the history of black people., I said many white people do not think this sense of racism is around.,because
45650_2,The white people were making great points for their case.,The black people were just dodging their questions.,and
43935_3,the disadvantages.,I think that by taking a knee.,and
46024_1,Society needs to get a grip on what issues are truly important.,Society needs to get a grip on what issues can get less attention in the media.,and
43695_2,We are only really exposed.,Our parents want to show us.,and
42904_1,This really stuck with me.,I have often thought about some of the far right Christian groups in America.,because
43985_2,I have learned a lot.,There is much more to learn.,and
45844_4,I do not understand.,Empathy allows me to try seeing another point of view.,and
45230_2,hey ignore what they dont want to hear.,hat they do not seek to learn more than they already do.,and
46476_6,They got to hear each other out.,and put themselves in each others shoes.,and
45365_5,It's so they are able to play football.,These athletes are squashing all of the military's hard work.,and
43380_1,all police officers are not racist or violent towards black people minorities.,there is definitely discrimination that takes place in some situations,Nan
44720_1,"Overall, this lecture was really powerful.",It helped me to put myself in the shoes of a Muslim person.,and
46362_6,A white student respond.,"you have this power ,privilege that you don't see this racism.",and
43992_1,I was also shocked.,Little attention was paid to it.,and
45533_3,The statistics were about wealth.,The statistics were about racial jobs.,and
43771_4,an assumption would be that the foreign policy for Iraq would be different,according to Basim there all the same nothing is different.,so
45523_3,More people knew the proper statistics.,It would definitely not be a bad thing.,and
45383_1,Kneeling during the anthem is disrespectful to those that fought for our country.,Kneeling during the anthem is disrespectful to those that have died.,and
45732_1,I do know that holding in that pain would hurt me.,It would be best to eventually let it go.,and
44708_3,This lesson made people more aware about the reality of how other people live.,This lesson made people more aware about what they have to deal with on a daily basis.,and
45785_3,We get to hear stories.,We don't just read out of a textbook.,and
44000_1,I like the fact.,Sam brought two people who would be somewhat related to the situation.,and
44879_3,It was built upon free slave labor.,The rich white slave owners are made even richer.,Nan

43162_3,We were presented with data that was shocking to many regarding the number of Americans unarmed killed by the police,We were presented with data that was shocking to many regarding the breakdown of these numbers by race.,and
46305_1,This activity of switching sides and making the whites speak and give opinions or responses as if they were black.,The black doing the same thing as if they were white was very eye opening to me.,and
45079_5,Others would look at you.,Maybe think that you're not as correct as you think you are.,and
45435_3,"One girl made a lighthearted comment about not having to worry about her hair.,",All 5 of the hijab wearing women laughed.,and
46327_3,That was the only opportunity they really had for work.,The laws that were created to keep them at the bottom.,and
45715_1,This activity defiantly opened my eyes. ,It showed me some things I was not aware of. ,Nan
45358_2,President trumps wishes to restrict with the hopes of preventing more acts of terrorism.,Even though 99.99% of Muslims do not support these terrorist organizations.,Nan
45388_1,Businesses were not giving any opportunities for African Americans to work in the work field.,Many were not given access to schooling or quality education of any kind.,and
42803_2,He has seen a countless number of tragedies.,This has lead to the development of his PTSD.,and
45618_6,To forgive his enemies there is no other way that will benefit not only him,to forgive his enemies there is no other way that will benefit others.,and
44699_1,"As a white female, it has always been hard for me.",It's hard to place myself into the shoes of people of different backgrounds.,Nan
46038_4,Maybe the military should be required to learn about the culture of the countries they enter.,it could stop many tragedies from happening.,and
46323_2,But slaves had places to live on the plantations.,Slaves had laws protecting them.,and
43812_5,Why are muslims generalized to be violent?,Why are muslims generalized to be sexist?,and
45484_2,It is true that half of us are just starting to learn about all of the important issues.,It is true that half of us are just starting to learn about all of the relative issues.,so
44033_3,It's something embarrassing that we did.,It is an act that can be easily brushed under the rug.,because
45531_1,It makes sense that African Americans know many things.,African Americans know about Black History.,because
46376_3,That doesn't take away any of its importance in our country's history.,That doesn't take away any of its relevance in our country's history.,and
42949_1,It is hard to take in that my own government has destroyed  many lives.,They try to protect their own citizens.,so
45113_1,I wish someone had the answer to that.,Im just not sure why.,because
46252_2,"However, I am impressed.",I admire that there are lots of people who like Basim.,and
44040_1,The media plays a big part in why a double standard exits.,The media plays a part in why we only hear about certain things.,and
44588_1,I liked how you mentioned the Christians part. ,I related to that the most. ,because
43893_2,It is important that we criticize our President when needed in order to make sure that we stay informed.,It is important that we criticize our President when needed so that they are pulling through on the promises they make.,and
44866_6,Listening in on this lesson I felt arrogant.,Listening in on the lesson i felt naive.,and
44903_2,The war continued to 2011,It killed many innocents and soldiers. ,Nan
45057_2,"Too often, we humans make no effort to actually help others.",We make no effort to take that empathy to fruition.,and
46282_8,You cannot use them they are not a backbone of beliefs.,"We all can see, it is easy to skew numbers in someones favor.",because
45542_1,Not only have we become so ignorant to forget its origins.,We seem to think slavery was something only white people did to black people.,Nan
46434_1,It definitely seemed like what they said started out as a joke.,You could see.,because
43798_1,American citizens often do not think about other countries.,American citizens often do not think about citizens that populate other countries.,and
44598_1,People are noticing., In some ways it is good.,and
46336_1,I suppose that's why we all take different paths in life.,I am happy that trips like the one Mark Evans pitched exist.,and
44643_1,Dr. Sam Richards prompted question to the black group in the front of the class.,He said something interesting.,Nan
42902_2,Forgiveness is a quality absolutely admirable for his situation.,Not many people have that ability to begin the process of moving on.,Nan
46265_3,Global citizens it is our duty to find truthful media sources., I believe will not only allow us to learn more about other people.,and
44765_2,The dialogue made me more conscious of ideas about hijabs that Id had.,A part of me thought it was sexist that Muslim women wear them.,and
43777_2,Muslims look at the United States. ,They think we are their enemies. ,and
45490_4,What steps could we take to reduce police brutality and make up for the failures of the system?,Weeding out those with bias is often hard.,because
43686_3,I think.,This world would be a lot better off.,Nan
45047_7,Videos were not seen.,There was an in class demonstration.,and
45241_2,It is his constitutional right to not stand during the national anthem.,what he did is not disrespectful toward the flag.,and
42876_1,No religion states that they should kill people.,The actions of people should be judged by that person.,and
46325_3,White people did not want to give up what they had to black people.,White people created a system that allowed them to stay on top.,and
46001_6,He has influence under his belt.,His actions and words can only reach so far.,and
46471_1,This is definitely one of my favorite lectures.,Most people have a perspective about Muslim women's dress.,because
44996_5,We call Muslim extremists Muslims.,terrorists as Muslims.,and
44265_1,I agree with what you said.,The American people have not been exposed to the majority of Muslim people.,Nan
45920_4,We tend to believe.,That we are always right.,and
43363_3,They are forgiving like Bassim.,They think to themselves.,and
45278_1,Another thing that shocked me was the alarming statistics.,The alarming statistics had proven many crime rates drug deals etc.,Nan
44764_6,They feel less under the judgmental eyes of people.,made me reconsider some perceptions I had about the hijab being a little demeaning...,and
44041_2,The media have somehow developed the power to choose what gets to be talked about.,The media have somehow developed the power to choose what's not talked about.,and
44841_2,A loss of a life is a loss of a life.,We have to have faith in the judicial system.,and
43221_3,There are many loopholes.,That can be discovered in their pages link.,because
45025_1,"Living in a world that is constantly evolving, it is expected that the topics.",Ideas discussed in a class about race are inclined to vary each semester.,and
44764_1,There was a talk on hijabs.,It made them feel safer.,and
45121_1,It was  engaging.,everyone seemed to be speaking from their heart.,and
43498_1,I found it extremely eye opening to hear about these events through the eyes of an actual native american.,I found it extremely eye opening to see his reactions whenever a picture would be put up or just simply how we sang and explained what he does for a living.,Nan
45300_3,I really did learn something from it.,I learned an invaluable lesson.,Nan
44280_2,The media generalize all police officers.,They are generalized as the bad guys in all of these situations.,Nan
44468_2,He was alright speaking to us.,He does not have ill will towards the American people.,and
43960_1,I'm going to be talking about The Politics of Taking a Knee.,I'm not sure if this was one of the videos.,so
43028_1,They are kneeling to show that there is still inequality and injustices in America.,Inequality and injustices in America need to be dealt with.,Nan
45435_4,All 5 of the hijab wearing women laughed.,All 5 of the hijab wearing women agreed.,and
43573_1,I was very upset to hear about what happened to Basims family., I could not even imagine the pain he had to go through and is still going through.,Nan
43074_1,Bassim says that presidents do not change.,It is because of this.,and
46202_1,To not talk about these topics would be insulting to African Americans.,some of themare still dealing with the consequences of enslavement and unjust treatment of African Americans.,Nan
44867_4,Everyone was equal.,They were not their ancestors.,and
42974_4,They need to be brought to the surface for us.,There isn't enough time to spend as much time as we should on each one.,and
45222_1,I do consider myself fortunate.,I live in a country where I am not scared.,so
44770_2,Try to see the event through their eyes.,The blacks already made their minds up.,Nan
44712_1,"Surprisingly, he was extremely accepting of the class. ",He did not blame anyone for this.,and
42979_1,A fish is the last animal to understand water.,It's spent its whole life in the water.,because
44042_5,This is going to the be the case.,Up to the time international voices demand that issue to be talked about. ,and
45674_2,They can just make laws to keep it very similar to slavery.,Without it being called slavery.,so
45929_3,It's how the racial status that the United States has today was started.,One civilization was a little bit more advanced in technology.,because
44864_4,I think about it mainly as history.,not about how it still exists in certain ways today.,and
44629_1,It is hard to be raised as something.,It is hard to feel so confused about it.,and
45270_2,It is equal to Muslim violence.,The comparison was an interesting one.,and
43721_1,For him to overcome and be able to forgive.,For him to overcome  move on from what happened to his family really got to me.,and
44142_3,Don’t state you believe NFL players shouldn’t take a knee. ,Propose a solution for the protest. ,and
46026_2,how can suppression on their people be reasonable?,how can suppression on their people be Understandable?,and
42853_1,This talk was awe-inducing .,"In England, many people were aware of what was occurring in the Middle East. ",because
45923_2,Fishes are always in the Water  they do not really know much about it; unlike us.,we see it from the outside we are not always expose to it.,so
43476_2,An individual who has chosen to see.,An individual who has chosen to understand.,and
44670_2,I wondered how this could be.,He started to state his religion.,and
45340_1,It flies every day as a symbol of the country we live in even though it carries our nation's faults.,it carries our countries greatest accomplishments.,and
43713_5,These people look , to our president.,and
46424_3,I personally never judged anyone who wore a hijab.,I did not think that wearing one for religious purposes was a big deal.,because
45411_2,He arrested her.,There was no reason.,and
43768_2,His whole family is from there. ,He lived a quiet life. ,and
46512_1,People see hijab as a flag for religion.,It is often a religion they know nothing about.,and
43528_1,Rafi in class was telling us that he works to create laws based of the Quran.,It's hard because it can be interpreted in so many different ways.,Nan
46371_3,The attack was on white people.,They thought we were bashing white people.,and
45459_1,I believe its important to take the time to further investigate issues.,Especially if it sounds like bull crap.,Nan
45604_5,Finding out that wearing the hijab was actually a choice was actually kind of a surprise for me.,Finding out that all the Muslim women who wear hijab do it because they chose to do so was actually kind of a surprise for me.,so
43419_1,I was completely disgusted with this whole situation.,I was completely disgusted with  the way the government dealt with it.,and
45863_1,the white people had very little knowledge of the struggles that black people have endured for many past decades.,The white people could only base themselves on surface knowledge.,and
42991_1,it make feel.,i feel ok,Nan
45850_5,It not only affects the time at the moment.,It affects centuries.,and
45748_2,Every race needs to have the same amount of privilege.,Not every race has the same amount of privilege yet.,and
44957_1,"For the first time, I wondered.",Their votes would have even made a difference.,and
43790_7,"On the other hand, mentioning Muslim we automatically associate this whole religion with the extremist group that were involved in 9 11.",who are seen as terrorists.,and
44063_7,I was never really taught about it.,I never really was taught to care much about it.,so
42785_3,He educates others.,He shares his stories.,and
45463_3,my ancestors were alive and well during the Civil Rights movement,that is where I felt that white people were at their most ignorant due to the ingrained inequality thought process that,and
45716_1,we learned of how the system was set up to put people of color behind white people., we learned of how the system was set up to put minorities behind white people I was shocked.,and
46329_1,I also thought it was interesting.,Sam switched the  roles.,Nan
45243_2,Many of the critics are also Trump supporters.,A good question to ask is why they kept quiet.,and
43531_6,they don't know how to find a solution.,"like you said, people just dont care because the problem isnt theirs.",because
45563_2,Media platforms must present information that the public wants to see.,Even if they are just reiterating the same facts over and over again.,Nan
46174_2,it was interesting to see their perspective about wearing it.,One of them saying that it gives you a different perspective because your not worried about yourself and able to look out in the world without so much worry.,and
45523_1,More people became informed.,More people knew the proper statistics.,and
43403_2,I was extremely sorry to hear about what happened to his home.,I was extremely sorry to hear about what happened to his family.,and
45593_1,I truly felt the class really listening to the song.,I truly felt the class was respecting the song.,and
43231_2,It is an amendment right.,He did not reprimand the protestors in Charlottesville and Ferguson.,Nan
43279_2,I enjoyed learning about Native Americans.,I enjoyed learning about their cultures.,and
44685_1,You said religion is a big aspect of who we are as individuals.,You said that it does not define us.,and
44231_1,This is a problem for citizens in the United States.,The only representation that group receives is on the media.,Nan
42931_1,The problem is that the extremists are in America.,they are not spoken about enough.,Nan
45852_2,I have learned.,I hope the other people think about the racial issues.,and
44103_5,I think its crazy he he tries hard to reach the issues from many different angles.,His lecture covers almost covers every single angle.,so
43500_2,It made me think a lot about Puerto Rico.,People have many misconceptions of the island.,and
46295_2,"Going out in public, I usually will wear long-sleeves.",I won't if it is really hot out.,so
43493_2,I would like to assume that the United States,I would like to assume that the United States,and
43426_4,People tend to ignore the Christian on Christian judgments.,There are little of these stereotypes.,so
42781_4,He pointed out that he would not let anger eat him alive. ,I really admired his courage,and
44179_1,A foreign government came your land.,A foreign government killed your loved ones.,and
45107_1,Anyone can imagine what could have happened.,His life would have changed.,and
42810_2,The posts are about how police are shooting unarmed black people all the time,They are getting away with it.,and
43757_3,We judge their community.,We judge their situation without thinking once.,and
43633_1,World events may have direct impacts on American lives.,Most Americans will not care about what is happening around the world.,Nan
44249_1,It is much harder to be the better person.,It is much harder to forgive others.,and
44755_4,They're alone or among other women.,They wear the same things.,and
46281_1,I enjoyed the lecture.,It humbled both sides of government.,because
46477_5, It was absolutely amazing to hear that neither group judged each other.,It was just a part of their life and a part of their culture.,and
44196_1,I think it was important for Sam to introduce Bassim.,The way he described him as a friend.,so
46286_1,Nobody is informed completely.,Getting news from one source is irresponsible.,and
46113_4,Stereotypes remain in our society.,That is where the role of white people as black people comes in.,and
45203_4,Whites were the last to do it.,It is just unfair.,because
42884_1,Why the media reports stories pertaining to African Americans being shot.,They have commented that this is due to their race.,so
46197_1,I believe we human beings we have the right to absolute freedom.,We complete autonomy in regards to personal decisions. ,and
43757_1,It is true that we immediately judge a person.,We judge their community.,and
43635_2,I wish I had learned this earlier. ,I would have a more worldly perspective.,so
45026_1,I admire Sam for the way he runs Soc119.,He simply allows himself to be human.,because
45995_3,I knew that it was a simulation.,The roles in the simulation were switched.,and
43762_4,He realizes there is good in the world.,Things are unimaginably tough.,and
43774_12,Health care isn't improving.,Pensions are not improving. ,and
44246_1,There have been different instances in my life in which I have held anger toward certain people.,In every occasion this anger accumulation harmed me more than the actual people I held a grudge against.,Nan
43508_1,The right attitude on life enables everything. ,Anything is possible.,and
44491_3,I have to rely on my faith.,It will get me through something challenging.,Nan
43332_5,It was a bombing by the American government that went awry.,It was never supposed to hit Basim's house.,and
45110_1,"At one point, towards the middle of this video, the video was shown of the white person who was just sitting in his car.",An officer beat him for no reason.,and
42788_3,It is the unethical decisions of our governments.,That had caused such afflictions. ,and
42934_1,the government.,who ordered the bombs to be launched.,and
45804_1,Are they not recognizing this?,They actually don't believe it.,because
44022_1,Basim says how his family is no longer living in one place together.,Everyone is separated.,and
45831_5,His strength is inspiring.,I hope that he will be able to share his story with more Americans.,so
43900_1,I only watch US news. ,I do not look at what is happening in other countries .,and
43187_2,there is a whole world out there.,The whole world is enjoying their life.,and
44681_1,I was able to understand why they felt that way. ,For just a moment I understood their lives. ,and
46201_4,they feel that these are all instances of the past,They think there is no need to continuously bring them up.,because
43736_4,all we hear about the Middle.,all we hear about the Middle.,and
44190_1,ISIS and other terrorist groups happened.,Many movies depicted Muslims in a certain light.,and
42878_3,Everyone in the world knows what actually is going on.,People are being affected.,and
45363_6,These athletes have such an amazing platform to speak up for what they believe in.,to not take advantage of that would be dumb on their part.,and
44360_1,My life or any lives,Won’t grab tv viewership,Nan
45178_5,The black families confused me.,The whole topic that we were discussing confused me.,and
45846_1,It was very interesting.,It gave me a lot of thoughts.,and
45153_2,He has to now live on for his son.,He has to now live on for his future family.,and
45908_5,The girls wearing hijabs talked about their hijabs., why and how they feel about wearing them.,and
45782_3,They were in fear for their life.,How fair is that?,and
46096_2,I gain strength.,I gain wisdom.,and
45132_1,We can't forget.,The problems are caused by the extremists.,and
46011_4,It affects the group that is doing the oppressing.,They may think that it is a problem.,and
45930_2,They really opened my eyes.,They brought clarity.,and
45069_2,Here's what we are taught to believe.,We are still involved over in the Middle East to better the situation over there.,because
44088_1,Congress by all means is not doing anything.,The President takes it upon themselves to act with unilateral action.,so
44847_2,This was one of my favorite classes.,I thought it was awesome to see the role switched.,so
45809_2,It is taking a minute.,It is thinking what it is like in the shoes of the people you are judging.,and
44327_2,Sam called out people who think they have lots of experience.,They think they are experienced on race.,and
44396_2,Videos of black people being discriminated is very publicized in today's media.,Videos of black people being killed by police is very publicized in today's media.,and
43023_5,We shouldn't assume that the people killing people in the Middle East aren't Muslims.,We shouldn't assume that the people claiming to be Muslims aren't Muslims.,so
43476_3,An individual who has chosen to understand.,Anger is not the answer.,and
45893_1,It was awesome.,My brother sat in on a class.,because
44188_3,It’s what the majority of the country practices. ,It makes the coverage of Christianity different than Muslims. ,and
45065_3,I immediately listened.,I have never heard a prayer like that before.,because
43021_3, It would make us look bad.,Why do people in the U.S. make such quick judgements about people who are different?,so
44105_1,I think we do need to be more aware.,We need to be more aware of not just the people and places out of the United States.,Nan
43673_1,A war was started by another nation.,It was fought on their own land.,Nan
45987_1,Many issues in the world are caused by anger.,Many issues in the world are caused by the unwillingness to see the bigger picture.,and
44473_2,We need to make it a point.,Government individuals who represent our country have a moral compass.,and
46471_3,Most people have a perspective about Muslim women's dress.,My perspective of Muslim women's dress is similar.,because
43364_3,Muslims aren't more violent than Christians.,We are all very similar.,so
43625_2,I was able to have access to that.,I have met many people from different cultural backgrounds.,and
44815_2,This stuck out to me.,I thought that it is common in American.,because
45117_1,It's crazy to me.,It seemed like the entire class was pretty shocked to see these statistics.,and
43598_2,I could not even imagine the pain he had to go through., I could not even imagine the pain he is still going through.,and
43061_1,Imagine that we send them clothes and gifts.,After Sadam and ISIS destroyed all their wealth they cannot afford many necessities.,because
44060_4,To have empathy you have to deeply try to feel what they're going through.,To have empathy you have to understand what they're going through.,and
45646_1,It was interesting.,Black people gave their take of the system.,Nan
46310_2,They pretty much set the rules.,They controlled the outcome.,and
45845_1,"Coming from a small town, I was not exposed to violence, different races, a lot of the things people have gone through.","To listen to others, what they have to say, learning new cultures, I have made myself more aware to having empathy.",so
45443_3,Only a few others participated.,I feel more NFL teams are taking part now in retaliation to Trumps comments.,and
42871_4,We live in a bubble. ,We don’t truly understand what we are. ,and
46119_1,"Among a few of my friends in the class, we were very divided on the effectiveness of the class.",There's no debate about it.,Nan
45249_2,I am here at Penn State.,I did not know much about this issue.,so
45892_2,I enjoyed this class.,My brother was at Penn State visiting me.,so
45482_1,Women are being forced to wear vails.,They do not drive cars.,and
46262_3,It's hard for students who have no real knowledge of this issue to understand how important it is to talk about these types of things.,It just bothers me that we were given this opportunity to see what racial inequality was and is like.,so
46126_1,I personally try to never judge in a negative way.,"Most thoughts seemed to be naive, immature.",and
44298_1,Most people would hold much resentment.,Most people would want to demonize America.,and
45078_3,It challenges your own believes.,It challenges your own opinions.,because
43733_4,Many different people could have different views.,Sharia Law should be enforced and conducted.,Nan
43376_2,"Growing up, I was taught the golden rule.",I think it's something a lot of adults tend to forget.,and
45697_1,Sometimes I find myself not forgiving people.,Basim's story about forgiving runs in my head.,and
44026_2,Basim Personally does not have any problems with our country.,Basim has enjoyed his schooling here.,and
43502_2,it is just a matter of spreading the word.,it is just a matter of focusing on all the topics that should be talked about in order to progress as a society.,and
45652_2,"Hopefully, in the future society can continue with dialogues like this.",It will begin to further address these perceptions.,and
44944_1,*Jeff Probst voice*.,This week on SURVIVOR,Nan
43418_2,Sitting will not help solve anything.,Waiting will not help solve anything.,and
45015_1,I think its a really creative idea to have the roles of black and white people switched when discussing history.,When discussing the different perspectives on slavery.,Nan
46059_1,The cop is a cop.,He swore to protect people.,because
43597_2,He shows how similar Iraq is to the United States.,He tells us what the United States government did to Basim.,and
43493_4,I would like to assume that the United States,I would like to assume that the United States,and
45844_2,I have not gone through a lot.,I do not understand.,because
45598_3,Many unarmed black people were shot and killed by the police.,It compares to white people and other races.,Nan
45304_4,The cop was doing a white person's job.,I have never experienced these issues first hand.,and
46386_1,"With this lecture, I now have a better understanding of the  inequality.",The vast inequality that was present in our country too long.,so
44814_1,He was very friendly with many American people.,He wouldnt stereotype everyone into one group of people that bombed his house or killed his family.,and
44381_1,"he majority of people follow their religion loosely, meaning they dont practice every single rule.", there are not people who do follow their religion to perfection.,because
44818_1,The roles were reversed.,Basim had been bombed in America.,and
43490_3,There is way on their homeland.,It is simply unfair.,because
45215_3,Her dad was facing intense racism.,Her dad interviewed for a few jobs.,and
43935_2, taking a knee.,the disadvantages.,and
42984_1,This has happened.,It happens at a minuscule rate compared to many countries in the Middle East.,so
46189_3,theyre trying to make a statement.,I respect it.,Nan
44620_2,You don't see a lot of other sports.,In northern regions you see a lot of hockey arenas because it is so cold.,and
45356_4,Pilots lock their doors.,some even carry guns in the cockpit.,and
46441_1,"Through this trip, however, he did not only cross the desert.","He started to learn more about it, its people and the culture.",Nan
46197_4,We complete autonomy in regards to personal decisions. ,We alone are the only ones who can judge ourselves. ,and
44485_1,That is why we have women studies classes.,There are black history classes.,and
44771_2,Sam asked if they paid attention to the news. ,Specifically the white lives matter movement. ,and
43943_2,The amount of courage and strength a person has to have in order to forgive someone whos wronged them is already really high.,I cannot tell you how much respect I have for Basim.,because
43661_3,the Middle East is always killing each other.,"the Middle East is not being exposed to their actual culture, belief, or way of life we are naive",and
43644_1,We do not know a lot about the world. ,We pretend to understand it all.,and
45385_2,It really brought to light just how awful the African American population was treated.,How they are treated in society today.,and
43886_1,Learning about the faith will definitely open peoples eyes.,What they really have to do is get out there.,and
42861_3,I admire his unbiased opinion towards american people.,Even with what happened to him and his family due to the U.S.,and
46366_1,"When the image of the white slave family was put onto the screen, and the girl said that It happened so many years ago.",it's not you guys on the screen.,Nan
44327_1,I love how Sam proposed this fun activity.,Sam called out people who think they have lots of experience.,and
45061_1,The Tainos were a peaceful people.,Columbus came.,and
44847_6,It was awesome to hear what the girls had to say about wearing hijabs.,It was awesome to hear what it means to them.,and
43731_4,many of the stereotypes about.,Sharia law is from the people.,and
45111_3,The police are supposed to be the good guys.,It's really hard to hear that they are brutally beating innocent people.,so
46077_3,Many Black people at this time were uneducated.,Very few would be able to vote.,so
46083_3,Reconstruction took place during this time.,"It caused black peoples lives to be much worse,",and
43764_2,The attacks on September 11 were malicious.,They sought to harm people.,and
45879_2,It can be hard to have.,It allows a different perspective.,and
45785_4,We get to hear stories.,We don't just read out of a textbook.,because
44516_1,You want to be mad at him for posing as another culture.,At the same time it worked.,Nan
42967_5,I tried asking myself what I would should something like this happen to me.,I don't know how I would react.,and
43114_7,theyd ever done terrible things to the community.,and how did that impact the society.,Nan
46462_1,One could make the argument that female hair is different.,Female hair can be sexualized.,and
44626_1,I had heard that this class was life changing.,It would really open eyes on a lot of issues.,and
44735_1,I thought the beginning of the exercise was powerful.,Sam began talking about how Africans simply used their resources/wit to travel up through Europe.,and
44447_2,Black people are scared for their lives.,A police pulls them over.,because
44043_1,"Kelly, I am very glad you were struck by some of the points that Sam made.",I was quite fascinated as well.,Nan
43553_1,There are some of the things many Americans are not sure of.,It is important that we try to educate people more on what is going on.,and
45643_1,Neither side wanted to actually offend one another.,Sam kept pushing them to really embrace their roles.,Nan
45003_3,The players kneeled during the national anthem.,He did not use that disgust on neo-nazis.,and
45849_3,I began to think about the image of God a s a black person.,I imaged the Mona Lisa as a black woman.,and
42799_2,There was nothing to be done about it.,It was due to the intense fear they installed in the people around them,and
43745_1,I used to naively care about my country., I realized about all the cultural differences.,and
45704_1,I could not even imagine.,What if that was happening around my neighborhood?,Nan
44032_1,The money was not sufficient.,The bomb claimed his home.,because
43558_1,Its also dangerous not to be informed.,Someone can be more gullible when they listen to skewed information being spread across the news media or social media platforms.,because
44477_2,White people are often ignorant.,We have a history of oppressing them.,and
42837_1,Americans need to realize that these people who are needy in these other countries are people just like us.,They are suffering only because of their geographic location.,Nan
46143_1,We have tried so hard to keep them from competing with our race at all costs.,I still feel that this is sometimes true in todays world.,and
45198_4,We know much more than the common person did in the 1400's.,We know more about the world.,because
43186_3,It would allow us to be more knowledgeable of what is happening outside this country.,It would allow us to be more aware of what is happening outside this country.,and
45468_2,How they felt about wearing hijabs. ,I had just never known much about their lifestyles at all.,because
43594_1,I believe everyone should have the chance to watch and hear from Basim.,It definitely changes perspectives on worldwide issues.,because
42975_1,Sam telling us that there is no set schedule of topics really made me think.,He can just decide one week what he wants to bring up in class.,because
43790_4,As you said they are mostly white people.,They are usually described in that way rather than a die-hard Christian.,because
45416_3,I feel like what unfortunately happens is media doesn't cover those events.,People wouldn't care.,because
43563_1,Mosul is a city a lot of people do not know about.,Many people forget what people in these areas have to go through.,and
45560_1,White adolescents are well privileged.,White adolescents are well educated.,and
42967_4,I tried asking myself what I would should something like this happen to me.,I don't know how I would react.,and
43193_2,giving them no safe space but also will inevitably end with botched missions ending in civilian death.,will inevitably end with botched missions ending in  destruction of their entire home.,and
44450_1,We need to become more culturally aware of other unrest.,We continue to turn a blind eye.,and
43657_1,Due to social media.,Those images started spreading fast.,because
42805_3,They should definitely fight for equal rights.,They should definitely fight to not be judged based on something that is purely biological.,and
44920_4,Kaepernick is doing it.,Kapernick is not causing no harm to anyone.,and
44326_1,We tend to put people into different labels by the first look we have of them.,We tend to put people into different groups by the first look we have of them.,and
42891_1,A police officer's job is to protect people.,Sometimes police officers have to hurt people to do their job.,so
46456_1,You could argue that the need women feel to expose themselves is a form of oppression.,It makes our bodies visible to men.,because
44726_2,"I find it ironic especially 9, 11,16 years ago.",The man who lost half his family due to an American bombing several years ago can be forgiving.,Nan
45017_1,Some black people act like white people.,They talk about their ancestors.,and
42933_2,How his religion says that you should forgive others.,Not hold resentment.,and
46324_3,White people had everything.,It wasn't like ending slavery brought them anymore prosperity.,so
46280_1,I think.,Racism is more systematically assembled in the world that I live in today.,and
45341_5,She said that she was comfortable in her religion.,She didn't feel the need to wear one.,and
45219_1,It seems so silly to break down a society.,The reason is unknown to all of us.,so
45414_6,It is easier to hate.,It is easier to judge someone who is not from the same group as you.,and
44649_5,I personally have no opinion on what someone wears,"like consent, someones body someones choice.",because
43854_6,"Why not do something more meaningful off of the field (such as starting charities, donating, being politically active or lobbying)?",Why not do something at a better time?,and
43811_3,Everyone has their own opinions., the bible can be interpreted in a million different ways.,so
43906_3,Christians tend to be hateful more often than Muslims are,Christians aren't going to hate on themselves.,because
44578_2,I expected Basim to say that he preferred the diplomatic Obama over Trumps harsh rhetoric.,I expected Basim to say that he preferred the diplomatic Obama over Trumps rough personality.,and
44468_3,He does not have ill will towards the American people.,He only has ill will towards the government.,and
44062_3,It's very important to take the time to understand their issues.,It's very important to see what you can do to help.,and
43604_3,I do hope they are more careful.,That they are more accurate.,and
43361_2,It is much easier to see flaws in others than to see it in ourselves.,we are a mostly Christian nation it is hard to see that Christians could be doing all these dreadful things,so
43224_2,A certain thing is shown to us in great detail.,We are only shown what happens in our country.,Nan
46271_4,I have realized  many things in the first half of this semester from this class.,The major thing that I have learned is that it is  important to have empathy towards people.,so
43688_3,He should forgive.,He should not hate.,and
45888_1,I found it interesting when Sam brought up the idea that there are classes for white studies.,"Sam  showed pictures of the poor white families, and the rich black men.",Nan
46191_1,They are being disrespectful  only trying to help.,"They are trying to make a difference, seems disrespectful though.",Nan
44303_1,I know.,I would barely be able to control myself.,and
43725_1,That is something that many of us believe.,That is something that many of us have a hard time fully understanding.,Nan
43836_1,People talk about., Muslims killing each.,and
43358_2,We would be more inclined to report only the facts of situations.,We would learn not to generalize people based on some piece of information.,because
42885_1,People listen to the news to get factual information.,That is not what is happening.,and
43251_2,I do not think that nationalism is a bad thing. ,I actually think it is good.,and
45148_1,There were somethings I was curious about due to me not knowing.,They were answered in this demonstration.,and
45875_1,We have made stereotypes based only on few people.,We have made stereotypes out of many things that have happened. ,and
43549_1,I have always been interested on what is going on the world.,It is something I have always been interested in.,and
45228_1,I liked what you said here. ,I agree with what you are saying. ,and
44629_2,It is hard to be raised as something.,It is hard to feel so confused about it.,because
45259_1, I thought about how narrow minded this frame of mind is., it promotes the lack of education of other societys.,and
43177_2,They might fight against each other to ensure they are the most powerful.,They might fight against each other to ensure they are right for everything.,and
44034_1,"So, we ask ourselves.",How much does it take?,Nan
43100_3,The US government shows no mercy towards minorities.,I feel personally victimized.,and
43490_2,There is way on their homeland.,It is simply unfair.,and
44192_4,We cannot pick one.,We cannot force it upon people.,and
44878_1,This shows only a sliver.,Slave traders thought that Africans' lives were meaningless.,Nan
44190_3,ISIS and other terrorist groups happened.,Many movies depicted Muslims in a certain light.,so
42909_1,This is a false equivalency but has led to a lot of misconceptions about Muslim people,I think this is where a lot of Islamaphobia comes from in 2017,and
43454_1,"So with all of these similarities in mind, why is it that we choose to only see the differences?",Why is it that we choose to only see the hate between these two groups of people?,Nan
45024_3,There is a responsibility to understand.,It is responsible to understand what is happening in other places.,Nan
43990_3,It is much easier to feel sympathy.,It is much easier to be more against what is going on.,and
45305_1,"I have had conversations with many different people about this, and other similar issues.",Again and again I find it hard to understand the other side.,Nan
45601_4,There are plenty of videos.,There are statistics that show evidence of this fact.,and
46412_1,I have very rarely seen a story of police brutality in the news.,The victim is a white person.,Nan
42860_1,It is clean he shows a great deal of strength and positivity.,Despite all that he has been through. ,Nan
44020_1,So much was taken away from him.,So much was taken away from innocent families.,and
45146_2,They are forced to rather than them wanting to,Hearing these women say they wear the clothes they do.,because
45431_5,"They approached it casually, like a Penn State student would.",They explained why they wear blue and white to a football game.,and
43000_1,The point you bring up is about the Quran being a helpful tool to an individual to stick to their religion.,It is important that people understand.,so
46228_1,I like that the five girls were willing to come up and talk about their own experiences with wearing this article of clothing.,Its safe to say that Hijabs can present a bad connotation for those who dont understand their purpose.,because
45011_1,"It's all over twitter, Facebook, the news.",We've been seeing many instances where police brutality has become really bad.,and
43796_1, Sam showed the stats of white vs. black.,Sam showed who gets killed more.,and
42801_2,His whole life was turned upside down.,The horror Isis has traumatized Bosum and his family.,because
44916_1,To add on to that.,Sam mentioned how a white person was murdered by police.,Nan
44362_1,The Westborough Baptist Church gets on the news.,The radical Muslims get on the news.,so
45018_3,It also showed how black people truly feel about the topic.,It must be frustrating when white people don't understand their perspective.,and
44554_1,I think.,"So many of us, including me, are ignorant to the outside world.",Nan
43776_1,We have created an enemy in Muslims.,We believe that they have wronged us.,because
45369_1,My mom was in the United States Army for 8 years.,I thought it would be interesting to see her side to things.,and
46510_2,You take them for their face value.,They are everyday things.,because
43463_1,Innocent people should not have to worry about their house possibly  getting bombed by the U.S.,Our nations security is definitely of the utmost importance.,and
42779_2,Our country has effects on people.,It is important for us to be aware of what is going on.,and
45832_1,Everyone has a right to protest for what they believe in.,These athletes are doing it peacefully.,and
45777_2,We continue to preach the land of freedom.,"With our fear to face our history, we will not grow.",and
43897_2,It's when we created our own thoughts.,We are awakened to reality.,and
44054_2,The data further strengthened the argument.,People of color have fewer opportunities.,Nan
43496_1,I had always thought.,I had always thought.,Nan
45450_1,Americans have every right to be upset.,Who gets elected?,and
46260_3,Racial inequality is a huge issue today.,Our country does not get the recognition that it needs.,because
44193_1,I think it would be very hard to make laws using one book.,It can be interpreted in many ways.,because
42944_5, it gives me a great deal of insight on how blessed I am to never have experienced something  terrible,it  changes my perspective on what our military is doing to these innocent people.,so
43722_3,It shows a lot of strength.,I think everyone could benefit from acting the same way.,and
42893_1,The people he loves most in the world were taken away from him for no reason. ,He has learned to live with that.,and
45864_1,I think that this shows the true divide in society. ,This shows the little education that is presented today.,and
45027_2,His intention is to challenge us,His intention is to push us to think outside of the box.,and
44578_1,I expected Basim to say that he preferred the more mild-mannered Obama over Trumps rough personality.,I expected Basim to say that he preferred the diplomatic Obama over Trumps harsh rhetoric.,and
45958_2,The pictures and videos struck a chord with people. ,For a second it was possible to think about what it was like to have that as part of your life.,and
45637_1,I find it crazy.,"Not that long ago, black people only counted as 3 5ths a person.",Nan
43162_1,We were presented with data that was shocking to many regarding the number of police officers killed in the line of duty.,We were presented with data that was shocking to many regarding the number of Americans killed by police,Nan
46229_1,The question of Sexism Caught my attention., its unfair that its required to wear them .,and
44847_3,I thought it was awesome to see the role switched.,It was awesome to hear what the girls had to say about wearing hijabs.,and
45409_2,She had marks on her neck.,This happened because her friend had weed on her.,and
43238_1,I personally don't wear the hijab.,I didn't grow up in an environment where I was made to feel like I had to wear it.,and
44058_1,By spreading the word on national television people all around the world will begin to talk about this.,With the right motivation change will soon come.,and
43777_3,Muslims look at the United States. ,They think we are their enemies. ,because
44673_2,It is what they rely on to get by everyday.,It is where they look for answers.,and
44350_1,Basim experienced tragedy because of the American government.,Yet Basim forgives.,and
45604_2,I did not know much about the Muslim religion at all going into this lecture. ,Finding out that wearing the hijab was actually a choice was actually kind of a surprise for me.,and
46155_1,I was nervous to do this segment.,I knew it was coming.,because
43249_4,Atrocities committed by Christians are often overlooked.,The target is them currently is Muslims.,so
44214_2,We went into Iraq because of security fundamental oil.,Our primary motivations for going into Iraq was to get something.,and
46336_4,I am happy that trips like the one Mark Evans pitched exist.,Others can enjoy them along with learn from them.,so
43722_2,I think it is very important for people to see this.,It shows a lot of strength.,because
45378_6,Not doing so is also a form of disrespect.,something that should be looked down upon as well.,and
43315_1,All we need to do is reach out. ,By connecting with people outside the US we can gain more knowledge. ,and
43905_2,It influences stupid people easily.,It's not really the media's fault that such social injustice exists.,because
44479_1,The fact that our government allowed this oppression to happen.,They justified it.,and
42975_5,He can just decide one week what he wants to bring up in class.,that means there was possibly something that made him think of it.,because
45163_1,The idea of wearing a hijab sounded inspiring.,The idea of wearing a hijab sounded empowering.,and
43579_1,The United States will not stop doing airstrikes., I do hope they are more careful.,and
44830_1,Basim speaking to our class helped us relate to the situation of an Iraqi civilian.,Lacking the knowledge of Iraqi citizens.,Nan
43221_1,"Therefore, it is insanity to base a society off of a religious text.",There are many loopholes.,because
44041_1,The media have somehow developed the power to choose what gets to be covered.,The media have somehow developed the power to choose what gets to be talked about.,and
45633_1,There was a reason this country was created.,Outsiders can have a chance at being happy in this country.,so
46419_4,Do you believe that they should pay for their ancestors' mistakes?,Then the Dreamers should do the same.,and
46419_2,Do you believe that White people should feel ashamed?,Do you believe that they should pay for their ancestors' mistakes?,and
45860_3,You see how poorly people were treated.,It was the color of their skin.,because
44954_2,"This person essentially said, indifferently, it is your country.",You should care about it.,and
44955_4,I knew I would just make the cut to be legal to vote. ,"after history of fighting for lowering the voting age, this was my chance.",because
45297_1,Everyone always says to stop.,Put yourself in someone else's shoes.,and
43249_2,America is a christian nation.,Atrocities committed by Christians are often overlooked.,so
44271_2,It showed that he was able to see past those who killed his family.,He was able to see past those who ruined his life.,and
43634_1,It is important to have a world view.,We should find a way to spark curiosity in American people about global issues.,so
45519_1,Basim is truly an inspiration.,Everyone heard his story.,and
42938_1,Basim knew there were a lot of Americans he got to know.,There were some he called his close friends.,and
43382_7,"I think it needs to change, 100%.",It needs to change soon.,and
43519_1,I totally agree with this statement.,We are busy being judging people.,because
45611_1,Sam says that.,It is very hard to study history.,because
43899_1,They are wrapped up in their own country's news.,They fail to pay attention to other places.,Nan
44775_1,There is one simple truth about the tension between races. ,It is because white people do not care. ,so
45088_1,It brings people together.,They understand what it feels like.,and
44250_1,He chooses to treat Americans with dignity.,He chooses to treat Americans with respect.,and
44728_2,Bassim mentioned.,He is not angry at the Americans.,because
44158_1,This question is hard to answer. ,I think political people just put on a show. ,and
46136_2,We as white people have constantly victimized this race of people in order to keep them down.,They could not be seen as our equal.,so
44954_3,"This person essentially said, indifferently, it is your country.",You should care about it.,so
42872_3,It really is an amazing opportunity to listen to what he talks about. ,It does open your eyes.,because
45635_4,It is important to make sure people know the real story in regards to slavery in America,It is important to know how the slaves and black community were treated.,and
46269_4, people are treated differently due to the color of the skin.,"It was peoples ancestors who did it, we are responsible to fix the issues , they are still happening in the present.",because
45821_3,They took pride in their beliefs.,It is something to be admired.,and
42974_3,They need to be brought to the surface for us.,There isn't enough time to spend as much time as we should on each one.,and
43986_2,There are many bad perceptions of different places in the world., We can choose to believe them.,so
45092_2,Race is something that should be talked about,Race is not something to be ignored.,Nan
46450_3,Women wear hijabs.,Women are more insecure about the way they look.,Nan
43265_1,Some of the data might be exaggerated.,It is very hard to argue.,so
45740_2,He says Africans at some point in time were slightly more advanced by obtaining feasible resources to make boats.,He said Africans at some point in time were slightly more advanced by the ability to travel.,and
45541_2,we have the ability to make them much better.,It is for future generations. ,so
45733_1,Bassim's story is inspiring.,His strength is inspiring.,and
45632_2,I just think to myself how the people in government are hypocrites.,Their ancestors are immigrants.,and
45098_3,Teachers thought that we were not mature enough.,That was a topic that teachers did not want to teach younger kids.,and
45492_4,Lawyers attend an extra three years of school.,"and must pass two entry exams (one being the LSAT and one being the bar), before being allowed to practice law.",and
43738_2,We often do not recognize them.,We are very sheltered here in America.,because
43778_3,the media sensationalizes.,i feel ok,and
44038_3,It happened. ,it was done by a group of Muslims.,because
45486_3,All the volunteers were regurgitating things that they have said.,All the volunteers were regurgitating  things that have been said to them.,because
46106_1,Having the roles reversed really gave me a glimpse into what it feels like to be discriminated against,I think that it definitely opened my eyes up to what has been going on for centuries,and
42859_3,We need to spread our knowledge to our family and peers to eliminate the phobia of the Middle East,it is faultless people who are losing so much of their lives due to the war.,and
45790_2,People were told to watch one another.,The had to report on anyone who may have had any form of privilege.,and
45376_3,Focusing on something that won't result in death is a bigger form of disrespect.,Focusing on something that won't result in death is an Un-American action.,and
46474_1,"Coming from an area high school that was predominantly white, I did not get to see many people of color or people of different cultures in my every day life.",I do get to see here at Penn state each and every day.,Nan
46161_4,"When she said those words, for a couple of seconds Sam turned to me.",we both shook our heads nodding approvingly.,and
45666_3,It isn't healthy to hold onto anger  long.,my entire reason why i am living is  my family.,so
43939_3,The war was unnecessary.,The war was immoral.,and
43854_2,They have plenty of fame outside of the football field.,Why not band together?,so
43919_2,They have different views.,They implement very different laws that affect the American people.,and
44057_2,It's to star a converstation.,That talks about change.,and
44477_3,White people are often ignorant.,We have a history of oppressing them.,because
45897_4,"Time after time, he heard the students in class say phrases.",he found himself saying.,Nan
45017_5,They talk about their ancestors.,They talk about what happened in the past with slavery.,and
46519_1,They were not judging.,They were not judging whatsoever.,Nan
44957_3,Their votes would have even made a difference.,The President can make much of a difference.,and
45817_3,We are always hearing about foreign dangers.,We have to realize that the people living in those countries can also be harmed from those same people.,and
44765_1,I consider myself a feminist.,The dialogue made me more conscious of ideas about hijabs that Id had.,and
45303_4,We have heard them everywhere.,I am even guilty of using those terrible responses.,and
45579_1,A lot of white people don't even realize they are being ignorant of the issues in black culture.,They are often only surrounded by people with the same beliefs.,because
43764_1,The attacks on September 11 were malicious.,They sought to harm people.,and
43727_1,Mosul was bombed by accident.,It does not make the action better.,Nan
45604_3,I did not know much about the Muslim religion at all going into this lecture. ,Finding out that wearing the hijab was actually a choice was actually kind of a surprise for me.,so
44867_5,Everyone was equal.,They were not their ancestors.,and
44198_7,It opened my eyes.,It devastates me to hear it.,and
42880_1,It is key to educate at a young age., in the long run one person can benefit and affect thousands.,because
45581_1,Our public education system in America fails to proved them with the accurate information.,They cannot form better arguments.,because
45012_2,We see videos.,We see headlines.,and
45504_4,Individuals that don't think there is a difference in the way blacks are treated.,Individuals that don't think there is a difference in the way whites are treated.,and
45159_1,One student said that she would think less about what she looked like.,She would worry less about other people’s view of her.,and
44548_4,His culture had to mix with non-native American culture in terms of his hair getting cut.,Him not having any connections to his family.,and
43288_1,Its no contest that these lessons come second hand to things like American history.,Its no contest that these lessons come second hand to things like American  other subjects.,and
46037_4,My family has endured.,My family lost so much through out the war currently happening on the part of the world.,because
45727_3,He had to just let it all out.,He had to just let it all go.,and
46163_1,My favorite part of the class was in the video segment.,The final message was delivered.,Nan
45568_1,We elected someone as arrogant and greedy as Trump.,The fact is no surprise to these people.,because
44359_2,They rarely are seen on news.,They are not that interesting.,because
43183_2,The main thing that I have taken from it is how the news outlets are biased.,They are steered towards either the left or the right.,and
45119_2,This is interesting to me.,People want you to think that more black people are being killed by police officers.,so
44292_4,They think we made everything much better.,I think we have made an impact to an extent.,so
44551_1,I was also devastated with Basim's story.,it made me realize how many other families had to go through the same thing.,and
45423_4,The issue of equal opportunity is alive.,and prevalent.,and
43575_1,I would probably try to do anything that I could.,To get some sort of revenge. ,Nan
45182_7,"At first, I think they found it hard to get into character.",They found it hard to find something to say.,and
45385_3,It really brought to light just how awful the African American population was treated.,How they are treated in society today.,and
45378_4,We take care of our own people.,Not doing so is also a form of disrespect.,and
44187_2,I don't think its because most Christians are white.,Europe colonized a lot of the world.,because
42935_1,I think it helped him a lot.,he lived within America.,and
44000_2,Sam brought two people who would be somewhat related to the situation.,Sam challenged their opinions on the matter.,and
44146_1,It's sad that we basically completely hate these people.,They aren't mad at us.,so
44152_5,Americans feel pride toward our country .,We also don't always focus on things that are not happening on our soil.,and
45304_3,The cop was doing a white person's job.,I have never experienced these issues first hand.,and
46338_2,Overall this lecture was very eye opening.,There are opportunities that I did not know existed.,and
44516_2,At the same time it worked.,Who's really the bad guy in this situation?,so
45438_1,I've heard similar rumors about hijabs being degrading.,I've heard similar rumors about hijabs suppressing women.,and
42807_5,They see social media posts.,They generalize about all police officers.,and
45738_1,I think that is the most important part of all of this.,There is an immense amount of division in this country.,Nan
46196_1,I respect the wearing of the spiritual clothing as a profession of their faith in their religion. ,There have been instances in the news where woman are shamed for expressing themselves in ways that the state does not deem fit.,Nan
46508_1,I grew up in a household of people who practiced Islam and people who practiced Christianity.,I sometimes wear one myself.,and
45876_2,Sometimes we should step back from the media.,It does a lot of the time show us.,because
44281_1,"Yes, there are many police officers who abuse their authority.",There are many police officers who take advantage of innocent citizens.,and
46278_1,Simple things that I never even thought about are starting to stand out.,Simple things are starting to stand out more to me every day.,and
44649_3,it is hard to feel that someones clothing offends you,I personally have no opinion on what someone wears,because
43364_1,Christians aren't more violent than Muslims.,Muslims aren't more violent than Christians.,and
43745_4, I realized about all the cultural differences.,I became more aware about other nations.,and
45367_4,I usually don't talk politics with her to much. ,We heavily disagree on many topics. ,because
45275_3,I had never considered how weird it would be to be black.,I had never considered how weird it would be to be always looking at pictures of groups of white people.,and
42843_5,They want to provide for their family.,exactly the same as the people living in the United States.,and
44774_1,"For a lot of white people, it does not matter if they help or do not help.",Their lifestyles will remain the same.,because
45337_3,It was for the men who fought for this country.,It was for the women who fought for this country.,and
46478_2,There are benefits to both. ,They respect it. ,and
45998_3,The arguments that the Black people made in this class were very ridiculous.,There are things that White people have said in real life.,Nan
46295_4,I won't if it is really hot out.,I don't have to think about whether people are looking at my scar.,because
46282_4,"Statistics can lie, you cannot take them at face value always.",You cannot use them they are not a backbone of beliefs.,because
42834_1,This whole class is about thinking and understanding other cultures and people outside of the United States.,This whole class is about challenging our minds to step outside of the preconditioned generalizations we have about other cultures.,and
45650_3,The white people were making great points for their case.,The black people were just dodging their questions.,because
44224_1,This specific lecture allowed me to view the world from a different point of view.,I was able to see both sides of every situation.,and
43792_3,"this fosters the generalizations that we pass upon a whole group of people belonging to that one religion, even though as we said in class, both Christianity and Muslim are fundamentally the same religions.", they both want everyone to be good people to the heart.,because
45046_3, that might sound like the ideal thing.,It does not matter how hard some people work.,and
42947_2,it literally destroyed an environment.,I have never experienced the slightest bit of an attack.,and
43874_1,I agree with Sam.,"He mentions we hear about Muslims killing other people, how they are terrorists, etc.",and
43160_1,Those are the ones who are traitors to their own religion.,They do not speak on behalf of the billions of wonderful people who practice their religion.,and
46245_4,I had many unanswered questions. ,It was very interesting listening to the girls perspectives on it.,so
45604_1,I was always pretty oblivious to this topic.,I did not know much about the Muslim religion at all going into this lecture. ,and
42917_1,How many times the police murdered someone of a racial minority may be small.,That number is not telling of the other brutality these cops have inflicted without a gun.,Nan
43363_1,There are many people who are very peaceful.,They are forgiving like Bassim.,and
43463_3,I am in no way saying we should not be cautious.,Maybe there needs to be more done about the screening process for these bombings.,Nan
43240_1,Some countries as you know have actual laws that tell women they have to wear the hijab.,"Some countries though they are majority Muslim like Senegal, could care less.",and
44666_2,I wanted to see something.,Everyone was saying something about the activity.,because
44782_1,He also said he wasn't angry with America as a whole.,He is just angry at the government.,Nan
44932_1,We were able to profit off of their oil.,I agree with the above comment.,and
44816_2,Similar to the one on Basims house.,That occurred in the US.,Nan
44847_4,I thought it was awesome to see the role switched.,It was awesome to hear what the girls had to say about wearing hijabs.,because
44580_2,It was shocking to me.,I'm an American.,because
46265_1,Global citizens it is our duty to find unbiased media sources.,Global citizens it is our duty to find truthful media sources.,and
43133_1,They are just trying to bring awareness to an issue.,they want people to pay attention to it.,Nan
44891_2,There is always a live band playing gospel music prior to the mass.,A young pastor basically puts lessons of the Bible into his own words.,and
44626_2,I had heard that this class was life changing.,It would really open eyes on a lot of issues.,and
42946_1,Our army has left this entire society with nothing but a broken system. ,A community in which people of the future will be negatively impacted.,and
45263_2,They should take a second to look.,They should take a second to see the majority of Muslims are just like us.,and
45380_6,There are better ways to show your opinions.,There are more appropriate ways to show your opinions.,because
44597_1,We should be focusing on other countries that are in need of help.,We should not be focusing on believing the media all the time.,and
44151_4,"When we do, there is much talk of improvement and how things will get better",I feel this proves change isn’t easy. ,so
43523_1,Sam points out that Christians pick and choose what they read and talk about.,they only read what they want to read.,Nan
43270_1,There is still enormous debate. ,White supremacist Dylann Roof killed nine African-American churchgoers.,and
46260_2,Racial inequality is a huge issue today.,Our country does not get the recognition that it needs.,and
44511_1,I highly suggest everyone watches Get Me Roger Stone on netflix.,You can get some insight into how Trumps campaign style works.,so
45058_4,Evidence has surfaced that shows these supplies are not being distributed.,There is nobody making sure that these supplies are rightfully distributed.,because
43359_1,I hope that I will continue to learn.,I hope that I will continue to grow.,and
45194_1,I know my objective history.,This class was interesting and enticing.,so
44390_1,It's almost selfish to support the well-being of the United States.,Very often many have to suffer to keep it this way.,because
45953_1,I also found it very interesting to hear.,White students talk about oppression.,Nan
43304_2,Jared Kushner got accepted into Harvard.,This was not due to his academic success or high SAT scores.,Nan
44811_2,Over time he forgave.,He had to continue on with his life.,and
45516_1,Many Americans have stereotyped all Muslims as terrorists.,Due to the very small percent that are terrorists.,because
43182_1,The media in the United States has the ability to fixate.,The ability to focus the nation’s attention on certain aspect of the Iraqi war.,and
44052_1,Kap and other football players did not believe in voicing their support for a nation.,The other football players believe the nation does not give everyone that lives under it equal opportunity nor equal rights.,Nan
45547_1,Serfs had some land.,Serfs didn't own land.,and
46177_2,Women were forced to wear it to keep themselves modest.,It was a rule that they had to keep themselves covered up.,and
45644_2,I enjoyed watching him.,He called people out for their actions.,and
44936_4,They were asked in class.,Does it get too hot underneath?,and
46114_1,This puts into perspective to white people that all the black people want to know is why.,"Why put them through slavery, why continue with the racism today.",and
45144_1,Sam told the women not to be politically correct.,The women might think they were being mean.,because
44118_3,"Not being able to discuss religion, at a younger age especially makes us ignorant.",It makes us naive to those around us.,because
42921_1,I do think that the most people in the United States think that Presidents have a lot of power,they control and change domestic policies way more than they change foreign policies,because
45121_2,It was  engaging.,everyone seemed to be speaking from their heart.,because
46504_1,We are doing an awful job of owning up to our history. ,Maybe thats why the saying history repeats itself is so relevant.,and
42888_2,I think she was nervous.,Peoples opinions about the police are not always positive.,because
45110_2,An officer beat him for no reason.,The reporter said that the officer did nothing wrong.,and
43910_1,These christian hate groups havent killed american soldiers or lives.,This is the main reason.,and
45700_1,I actually feel bad about believing the things that I did.,I was totally wrong,because
46188_5,He had been murdered by the police.,It shows that this movement is to create a system where EVERYONE is equal.,and
45818_3,It was informative.,It was inspirational.,and
45562_1,I agree with the fact.,It is likely that I think this.,Nan
44108_1,We need to take initiative.,We need to want to know what is happening.,and
45135_2,There is human nature of competition.,There is human nature of collectivization.,because
42840_3,We should be more aware of these issues.,We should inform other people about them.,and
45380_4,There are better ways to show your opinions.,There are more appropriate ways to show your opinions.,and
45298_1,You don't know someone's life.,Truly diving in is nearly impossible.,and
46257_6,it gave me a real look into what it was like to be a black person today.,I got to see it in a whole new perspective.,because

44461_1,"Honestly, I think it is a bit sexist","A lot of women, wearing the Hijab is not a choice.",because
44383_1,These were probably the heaviest.,These were probably the most moving 15 minutes of sociology 119 so far.,and
42872_2,It really is an amazing opportunity to listen to what he talks about. ,It does open your eyes.,and
44707_1,I think that we should be more active when black people feel like they are not being heard. ,I think that we should be more cooperative when black people feel like they are not being heard. ,and
43175_1,Sam mentioned that Bible is broad.,Sam mentioned the Bible doesnt provide details about what happen after someone had violated a crime.,and
45046_7,There is the sense of racism.," and in some instances, this caters to white people in the real world.",because
43683_3,This man is able to forgive Americans for what happened to his family.,Everyone should be able to forgive.,because
42941_2,"Listening to someone with first hand experience, talk about their hardships.",How it personally affected their lives.,and
45099_1,I think that it would have been beneficial to have learned about.,It would have helped me better understand society.,and
45132_2,The problems are caused by the extremists.,Those feel.,and
44809_1,I understand.,They are extremely devout to their religion.,and
45948_5,It allowed more honest past mindsets to shine through.,It allowed more honest current mindsets to shine through.,and
44408_1,It's never the religion that makes people slaughter each other.,It is the deep-minded thinking of I am better than you.,Nan
45736_4,Dr. Richards displayed it back to the class in a unique manner.,Dr. Richards made everyone question the intensity of the events occurring,and
44198_6,I had never seen a subsequent Mosul pic.,It opened my eyes.,and

43326_3,Eventually he realized.,Holding onto the anger was hurting him more than benefitting him.,Nan
43143_2,He would simply finda,His youngest recorded victim was 12,because
44613_1,Never has America seen a president so unique.,Never has America seen a president so polarizing.,and
43921_1,There is still corruption.,There are things being promised that never happen.,and
46237_2,There is a diversity in that room.,It opens doors to potential answers to questions everyone is thinking.,because
44179_3,A foreign government killed your loved ones.,A foreign government destroyed your life.,and
45844_1,I have tried to understand other people's feelings more.,I have not gone through a lot.,because
45215_5,Her dad interviewed for a few jobs.,The white contender got the job over him.,and
44008_5,We easily assume.,majority of the people that are victims of police brutality are black.,Nan
46444_1,"As a white female, Ive always had questions about the women who choose to wear a hijab. ",This lecture served to help me understand that choice.,and
45666_4,my entire reason why i am living is  my family.,my entire reason why i am living is my friends.,and
42807_2,I think people see these types of articles.,They see social media posts.,and
45418_1,I wish I had his willpower and strength because family is my life.,Just one person in my family died from something so tragic I would not be able to cope for the longest time.,and
44087_1,the United States grew bigger,it makes sense why the role of the Presidency has garnered much power.,so
44494_1,He was able to push forward.,He trusted his faith.,and
43167_4,The system will work in their favor.,Compared to blacks who feel the exact opposite.,and

43286_1,My dad grew up in Poland,My dad went to school in Poland.,and

42938_4,There were some he called his close friends.,Basim knew that our country did not intend for his tragedy to happen to him.,because
43183_1,I have taken a Politics and Media class.,The main thing that I have taken from it is how the news outlets are biased.,and
44795_5,It was seeing another side of the story,"seeing that first hand in the exercise, I definitely empathized more than I realized I would.",and
43047_3,War acts swiftly with no remorse.,War acts swiftly with no regrets.,and
46346_2,"All of the while, they picnicked.",They gathered together taking pictures.,and
45696_1,I think Basim ability to forgive is a lesson to everyone.,Holding a grudges it does more damage to you.,because
43674_3,Their lives are filled with the worst rage.,Their lives are filled with pain.,and
43856_3,"This time should be a time to remember my communitys lives, and not the soldiers.",We should focus more on my community.,so
44344_1,I found his response to be humane.,He stated that his religion teaches him to forgive.,and
44744_1,It is easy to find out information.,It's on the tip of our fingertips.,and
45992_1,We must first find a leader who is willing to help this country.,We elected someone who only acts in their own interests.,so

44694_4,News reports are being spread about the violence of groups following the same religion you do.,You should not feel guilty about it.,and
44033_1,News like this is not broadcasted all over in the US.,It's something embarrassing that we did.,because

45717_1,When we were learning of what the average American would make.,Separated it into black people and white people it really opened my eyes.,Nan
44172_1,We are not aware of the world.,The people in it are fearful.,and

44301_4,The tables were turned.,Some troops from the middle east came to America.,and
45483_2,People are having their freedom taken away. ,We Americans take that for granted.,and
43225_1,there is a lot of coverage of hurricane season in the Caribbean,it usually affects our shores,because
46390_1,"Digging deeper , acknowledging the things that black people experienced is something that people should be educated in.","Digging deeper , acknowledging the things that black people experienced is something that people should understand.",and
42805_1,"That being said, I support the black lives matter movement.",I think.,and

45882_4,It took our preconceived notions about race.,It switched the skin colors.,and
44696_2,It seems really crazy to me.,It is a clear example of how white people are erasing major components of black history.,because
46037_1,I currently hold a negative view on the middle east.,My family has endured.,and
43991_1,His story broke my heart.,His strength inspired me.,Nan
45210_3,I do think it is interesting.,The Black unemployment rate his higher.,so
43480_1,All my schools were similar.,They taught the same thing.,and
43358_4,We would learn not to generalize people based on some piece of information.,We would think about situations on a case by case basis. ,because
45799_1,Sam noted that we don't hear about Christians killing Christians.,we hear Muslims killing Muslims.,because
46268_2,I kept thinking everything the white black people were saying was very conceited.,I kept thinking everything the white black people were saying was very rude.,and
44451_2,The plea is not for himself,The plea is for people like him,Nan
45560_4,White adolescents see stories of black crime on the news.,White adolescents only see black crime.,and
45532_3,It's our nation's history.,We should all be aware of it.,and
45103_2,People should do that more often.,We wouldn't have such an offset of actions.,so

45623_1,I am not someone who has taken a lot of history classes in the past.,I was definitely super surprised.,so
46229_8, its unfair that its required to wear them .,Its something I have thought about myself.,because
46214_1,These were facts I never knew.,Thank you for bringing them to my attention Sam!,so
44674_3,I thought that was good to see.,Basim did not look to his religion for answers.,because

45329_2,It seemed like people didn't think Bush was a particularly smart guy.,Bush set up the economic recession with a disastrous SEC.,and
45811_3,We cannot advance if we fight over race.,We cannot advance if we fight over religion.,and
45994_2,He needs to be held at a higher value.,"He is the President, not a late night talk show host.",and
45573_1,Obviously this was surprising.,This story was unlike any other story about American history I have ever been told or heard before.,so

44460_2,It helps women be confident.,Other people would not focus on her looks.,and
45488_2,one group said that it was not a show of racism.,it was a a show of pride for their heritage.,and
42977_3,Sam discusses all this talk about Muslims killing each other.,There is not talk about all of the Christians killing!,and
44793_4,It was hard to follow.,The conversations were built.,and
46461_1,Some may argue.,Female breasts are very different than male breasts.,because
46252_4,I admire that there are lots of people who like Basim.,Who still holding the hope for their country.,and
42820_4,It baffles me to watch the news on white supremacists.,who claim that they are Christian.,Nan
43012_1,It is a lesson we can apply to situations that arise in our own lives.,It is a lesson we should apply to situations that arise in our own lives.,and
46251_4,It is unpredictable how many homes have been lost.,It is unpredictable how many cities have been destroyed.,and
44041_3,The media have somehow developed the power to choose what gets to be talked about.,The media have somehow developed the power to choose what's not talked about.,and
43292_1,We can try to do research on companies like Primark.,They profit off of foreign labor like what Bassim mentioned.,Nan
45873_1,Part of the reason I think that Sam switched the histories of white people and black people was to distance ourselves from the reality of our own society.,Understand a different world where one group is on top and one under them.,Nan
45204_2,White people benefit today.,They benefit from past dominance.,because
44553_2,Here's what I think.,Maybe the United States government can't stop the war due to their conflicting differences.,and
43962_1,I see the national anthem as a tool that brings people together., the national anthem  creates a sense of patriotism.,and
44130_2,We can never see this.,We are constantly being taught only negative things about them.,because
43279_3,I enjoyed learning about their cultures.,I feel like it isn't talked about as it deserves to be.,and

43244_2,how many countries force their womens teams to run around in underwear and bras?,It is due to the uniform rules,because
42791_3,"As people who are fortunate enough to live in such a safe country, we have been spoiled to think about our first-world problems.",Problems outside of the United States have never been such a constant reminder in our lives. ,because
45232_1,We need to learn to better ourselves.,We need to make a conscious effort to better our understanding of others.,Nan

43741_5,He was able to see past our military.,Every American was not responsible for what happened to his family.,and
44721_2,You are right.,We need to be more aware of what is happening around the world.,and
46336_3,I am happy that trips like the one Mark Evans pitched exist.,Others can enjoy them along with learn from them.,and
43812_3,We generalize Christians to be innocent.,We generalize Christians to be holy.,so

44740_2,American education systems literally teach about how white europeans enslaved Africans.,They forced them to build the country we all call home now.,and

46001_2,The president is only one person.,He does have quite a lot of power.,and
45225_1,The media portrays the world as such a hostile place.,It is not in the United States.,so
44795_2,To see sam tell the story of how life was with slavery.,Sam described the treatment of the whites was mind boggling.,and
44368_1,These terms  get thrown around.,labels get thrown around.,and

45141_8," we all different upbringing , we all go through different trials.",Tribulations  that's why we should be more open to the world.,so
45649_5,It's unfair for black people., even other non-white minority groups.,and
43971_1,The number of unarmed killings was surprising.,The media shows us more stories where the person killed was unarmed than anything else.,because

44899_1,I would be consumed by sadness.,I would be consumed by anger.,and
45326_1,It made no difference to Basim.,The American President made no difference to Basim.,because
45870_1,Sam went quickly to the question of why would people believe the police officer over the civilian.,One of the answers was that the police felt threatened by the individual who was resisting arrest.,and
45017_6,They talk about their ancestors.,They talk about what happened in the past with slavery.,and
43361_3,we are a mostly Christian nation it is hard to see that Christians could be doing all these dreadful things, it is hard to see that Christians could be a part of many horrific hate groups.,and

43014_1,People make generalizations. ,The media depicts them in generalized terms. ,because
44737_1,Having the 6 students play along with the role reversal helped me.,I visualize the possible excuses of both sides.,and
44427_1,They removed who they are.,They left the man behind.,and
45083_1,What I like about this class is the role reversal.,What I like about this class is having different people experience what it feels like being the opposite race.,and

45100_2,Ignorance is an important aspect of racism.,Ignorance needs to be discussed.,Nan

43262_5,It's in the news a few weeks.,It takes up a lot of our attention.,and
43904_3,The information being presented to them is not complete.,Media organizations portray what gets the most ratings: negative news.,and

44905_1,"It's getting worse, one problem causes another",its like a snowball being rolled,because
43973_1,"Personally, I have grown up around many Christians.",I not grown up around a lot of Muslims.,and
45733_2,His strength is inspiring.,I will never forget the story he shared with the class.,and

46133_2,I do not believe that they have the right to tell me what I can do with my body.,I respect that they appreciate  their religion and government enough to follow these ideals.,because
45206_5,He made the black people pretend to be white.,He had the white people pretend to be black.,and
43442_1,He talks about radical Muslims.,This is the stereotypical way we view Muslims.,Nan
46126_2,"Most thoughts seemed to be naive, immature.","Immature in a way like arent they hot, do they play sports, ect. ",and

43733_2,The Quran is only so many pages.,It can be interpreted in many ways.,and
42788_2,I believe it is the greed.,It is the unethical decisions of our governments.,and
45016_2,There is ignorance when white people talk about slavery.,There is ignorance about how defensive they can be.,and
44450_5,We continue to turn a blind eye.,Who are we to say we are better than the people bombing towns?,because
43251_3,I actually think it is good.,The way we achieve these feelings is important. ,Nan
43740_2,I commend Bassim a great deal for this very respectable response.,It was an absolute tragedy that happened to him.,and

45882_1,I found this activity interesting.,It took our preconceived notions about race.,and
44815_5,I thought that it is common in American.,They stereotype other people easily.,because
44692_2,"I think, when it comes to the image created about those who follow them, it is important, not to feel guilty about being a part of it.",It is important to realize that those people are not a representation of your specific group.,and
43852_1,Doing during the anthem is a backhanded way to make their protest seem more important.,This is normally a time of great reverence and respect.,because

44438_1,The police felt threatened by the man sitting in the car.,That's why the police beat the man up.,so
45257_3,We can make people understand.,We can make people become better.,and
43358_3,We would learn not to generalize people based on some piece of information.,We would think about situations on a case by case basis. ,and
45012_3,We see videos.,We see headlines.,because
43534_2,About Muslim people in Islamic countries.,I am pretty sure it is the lack of education.,and
43109_1,The US is not a perfect country.,We are better off than people in countries like iraq.,Nan

44731_1,Back to my original point about anger.,I feel that anger is a satisfying emotion to feel.,Nan
44455_2,Men forced women to cover up.,Women would not tempt anyone.,because

42888_1,I think she was nervous.,Peoples opinions about the police are not always positive.,and
46183_1,I understand it is their culture.,It is how they are raised.,and
43264_1,They are fighting for equality.,They saw that they had to fight for it in the 60s.,because
44916_4,A white person wasn't given justice. ,the black lives matter movement joined in to protest along side the family.,so
46505_1,We never came to terms with what happened.,We will be oblivious to all the wrongdoings happening even today.,so
45483_1,I now see how the people are being controlled.,People are having their freedom taken away. ,and
45636_2,It was interesting how Sam had our class switch roles.,Sam made people look at America's history.,so
43191_5,There is nothing stopping the US from flying these drones over every country in the middle east.,There is nothing stopping the US from flying these drones over every country in the northern Africa.,and
44624_3,There was a bias that only black people can play ball.,There was a bias that blacks were good at ball.,because
45140_2,To find a better life.,To find opportunity.,and
45000_1,A majority of Islams following have no association at all to terrorist organizations.,They are normal people.,and
44710_3,Sam told us that Bassim was on the screen skyping with this class.,We could hear his actual reaction.,and
44528_1,The disconnect you feel when you hear a story or see a picture is not there.,The people who have lived those situations are right in front of you.,because
43598_3,I could not even imagine the pain he had to go through., I could not even imagine the pain he is still going through.,and
44013_2,He starts talking about ISIS.,They came to Mosul.,and
45257_1,It is hard to say what we can do.,We can make people understand.,and
43292_6,We should try not shop there., its less expensive.,because
45352_2,They want us to see.,We perceive the rest of the world.,so
44662_2,I didn't want anyone to have anyone ostracize anyone else because of what they thought.,The worry was short lived.,Nan
45607_5,I believe that more people should really get to know principals of other religions,we would all be a lot more tolerant with one another.,and
44545_4,We took their ancestors lives.,We completely manipulated their population.,because
44951_2,Nothing has changed since 2003.,Imagine if we told this to the divided United States of America.,Nan
43643_1,This was a great request.,This request is something we all need to adhere to.,because
43672_3,I would go to extreme lengths to ensure the ones who caused the tragedy in my life to be severely punished.,"Preferably, dead immediately.",and
44759_1,Sams attempt at getting them to not answer politically correct seemed like he wanted them to say that the girls do look slutty due to their clothing.,Sam's attempt at getting them to not answer politically correct seemed like he wanted them to say that the girls do look unclean due to their clothing.,because
44384_2,He met Basim through Basims response to the Ted Talk.,He soon became friends with Basim online.,and
42928_4,I had an open mind.,"but I understand religion much more from meeting, speaking, and asking questions to Muslims that I have met from leaving my home town and going to college.",so
43660_1,it make feel good.,only done by the extremist groups.,Nan
43022_2,It's important to not make generalizations.,Generalizations about groups of people.,and
46269_2, people are treated differently due to the color of the skin.,"It was peoples ancestors who did it, we are responsible to fix the issues , they are still happening in the present.",and
45017_7,They talk about what happened in the past with slavery.,It shows how insensitive white people can be.,and
46385_3,Sam said.,Blacks are peacefully protesting for their basic rights.,and
44650_1,It is not up to me. ,I can’t tell people what to wear. ,and
45622_6,"Myself, I will try to forgive those who might hurt me in the future. ",and live a peaceful life.,so
43157_1,Bottom line is that Christianity is a beautiful religion.,Islam is a beautiful religion.,and
44507_1,Trump took a situation.,NFL players were protesting about legitimate issues,Nan
46201_3,they feel that these are all instances of the past,They think there is no need to continuously bring them up.,and
44159_1,This goes back to when I said people are blinded by pride in who they support.,"On the outside it may seem like a person has it all together and has the fix, when actually they don't.",because
45801_3,We can't generalize that all Muslims act like ISIS members.,It is simply not true.,because
44226_1,It was interesting to see the comparisons.,We don't acknowledge Christians killing Christians.,because
43026_1,The problem in my opinion is that the purpose they are kneeling is being overshadowed by the president.,"He calls them names and accuses them of not supporting the anthem, flag, and troops.",Nan
45607_1,I believe that more people should took the time to actually study.,I believe that more people should really get to know all the rules.,and
45141_7," we all different upbringing , we all go through different trials.",Tribulations  that's why we should be more open to the world.,because
44289_4,These people have struggled enough.,These people deserve a better quality of life.,and
44670_1,I wondered how this could be.,He started to state his religion.,and
43943_5,I cannot tell you how much respect I have for Basim.,He was able to forgive.,because
43382_3,"Being a white woman, I don't understand that fear in relation to the police/police brutality.","It is tragic, the extent of people who have to experience it.",so
45814_3,There are people who follow a plethora of religions.,Many people are presumably good people.,Nan
43662_2,"In Sam's one lecture, he shows the class.",There are radical Christian groups.,Nan
45699_2,I only believed things I knew.,I only perceived based off what I knew.,and
43622_1,Mr Bassim mentioned.,He believes that British people are more globally aware than American people.,Nan
45474_1,They wear clothes like that indoors.,The do not judge what kind of clothes other women wear.,so
44573_2,I recognize how influential the media is in our society.,The media is influential in our personal thoughts.,and
43025_5,These athletes are protesting peacefully., What is the problem?,so
44794_3,It was flip flopped with feelings.,It was flip flopped with actions that happened throughout time.,and
43283_1,I feel that there is always a reason for everything.,He is meant to serve a purpose in this world.,and
45816_2,I have already begun to think about people differently.,I've come to understand or want to explore things about people.,and
44321_2,He discussed his past living arrangements.,How similar everyday life was compared to America.,and
43310_5,There's a lack of formal education on foreign countries.,We tend to turn towards the media.,and
44676_2,We are able to grow as individuals.,"More importantly, that's how we bond with people.",Nan
46477_3,Sam asked them what they think about each other opinion wise., It was absolutely amazing to hear that neither group judged each other.,and
44103_4,I think its crazy he he tries hard to reach the issues from many different angles.,His lecture covers almost covers every single angle.,and
44884_2,It helped me build my perspective on the world we live in.,It helped me build my perspective on the race in our society.,and
43229_3,Gotten away with copious offensive statements.,Targeting minorities.,and
43143_6,he wanted to have sex with them and would threaten with violence and imprisonment,ifagirl didn't comply willingly.,Nan
43182_2,The ability to focus the nation’s attention on certain aspect of the Iraqi war.,This makes American look like a super hero coming into a country.,and
44821_1,We should all take a page from Basims book.,We should not put everyone in a certain group.,and
46011_6,They may think that it is a problem., attempt to address and fix it.,and
45682_1, It comes down to the intimidation.,It comes down to the fear of the unknown.,and
43750_1,Sam is constantly trying to evolve this class with current issues.,It makes the class great.,so
42818_1,Our school system should definitely be educating our youth more on people outside of our country.,There are real people and families out there.,Nan
45198_3,We know much more than the common person did in the 1400's.,We know more about the world.,and
44657_2,We as the millennials need to show everyone that it is okay.,It's okay to to dress how you dress.,and
45117_2,It's crazy to me.,It seemed like the entire class was pretty shocked to see these statistics.,because
45411_1,Her gripped her up.,He arrested her.,and
45441_1,This conversation really opened my eyes to see beyond stereotypes.,What its like wearing hijabs.,and
46044_4,It is admirable.,", and very respectable.",Nan
43212_1,"It's crazy to think that people believe such a small book has enough information and detail in it to form a coherent, functioning society.",The Bible or the Quran are examples of small books like that.,and
44007_1,This shows that even people close to the matter don't have a clear idea of what goes., Even people close to the matter are soon to choose sides.,and
45611_2,It is very hard to study history.,We don't see the relevance today.,because
44297_1,He lost people.,People that cared for him.,Nan
43256_1,There seems to be this sentiment that since we are America that we need to be the worlds police.,I really do not agree with that.,and
45416_1,I agree with you.,"The terrorist attacks that are happening in Uganda, South Sudan, CAR and the democratic republic of Congo are horrible.",Nan
42980_3,We don't think about it.,All the white people we know aren't doing that.,because
43185_1,it make feel ok,meet people from across,and
45277_1,This is interesting.,Consider it flip-flopped.,because
45374_1,Puerto Rico got hit by two of the largest hurricanes on record.,There's limited coverage of the aftermath.,and
45098_4,Teachers thought that we were not mature enough.,That was a topic that teachers did not want to teach younger kids.,because
44413_1,There are Muslims who use their religion for violence.,There are Muslims who use their religion for hate.,and
43176_3,Imagine a group of people decided to interpret the meanings.,Say they spread out the thoughts.,and
45645_1,I grew up in a mostly white area., I never really put much thought to this topic,so
45882_5,It took our preconceived notions about race.,It switched the skin colors.,because
43047_4,War acts swiftly with no remorse.,War acts swiftly with no regrets.,and
44889_2,I  go to church every often with my parents.,It has always been somewhat boring to me.,so
43167_1,White Americans don’t push to have the media cover their killings.,They have faith the justice system will prevail.,because
44865_2,It was hard to not find it comical.,It was very skewed.,because
42968_2,The way that he handled this unfortunate situation struck me.,The way that he handled this terrible situation struck me.,and
42846_2,People are free to practice whatever religion they want.,People are free to not be discriminated against.,and
43249_3,Atrocities committed by Christians are often overlooked.,The target is them currently is Muslims.,because
43262_2,It's the biggest thing online.,It's in the news a few weeks.,and
44251_1,"Furthermore, he is mature enough.",He sees that not every American is like the people that took his family.,Nan
44679_1,They help you strengthen your own opinions.,They could also open your eyes.,and
42856_1,This is our fault.,we tend to want to hear about celebrities glorified lives and every step they take,because
45531_3,African Americans know about Black History.,African Americans take more classes about the history of slavery.,because
45374_4,There's limited coverage of the aftermath.,There's little being done to actually help the citizens.,and
45487_4,You could hear the emotion in their voice.,You could see how comfortable they were in their body.,and
44642_1,We are the ones who created war,We are the ones who can end it,and
42940_1,Personally think.,I get one type of emotion listening.,Nan
44209_2,Sam and Basim explain to the class.,The United States came into Iraq and broke a system.,Nan
44398_4,The internet makes people believe that thousands of unarmed black people are killed by cops every year.,This in not the case.,and
45905_1,A good example is the idea that all people from Iraq are associated with Isis.,That is not true.,and
43176_6,Say they spread out the thoughts.,They persuade everyone to join them.,and
44843_1,We should be taking a greater interest into other countries.,We should be taking interest in how they are living.,and
44424_2,I'll admit to cracking a smirk.,It is something I have never heard.,Nan
46392_3,Explaining our history was eye-opening to me.,It happened to white people.,and
43598_1,I was very upset to hear about what happened to Basims family.,I could not even imagine the pain he had to go through.,and
46044_2,He has decided to forgive.,It shows how strong of a person he is.,and
43141_4,He used biological weapon. ,to gassing and so on.,Nan
43412_1,I've learned over the years that you never really know what goes on in the government.,Many secrets are obviously kept within them.,and
43475_2,you wondered why most of the class wrong.,you assumed we thought Basim would be angry,and
45711_1,More people need to hear about this to understand that things like this are happening around the world,The government should be held accountable when something like this happens.,so
45141_5," we all different upbringing , we all go through different trials.",Tribulations  that's why we should be more open to the world.,and
46230_2,stating that they dont feel pressured in any way.,"essentially, its their choice.",and
45452_1,That doesn't make me proud to be American.,It makes me more mad.,and
44864_3,I know about oppression.,I think about it mainly as history.,and
44215_1,Sam brought up a good point.,Sam asked the class to imagine if someone came to war here.,and
45023_2,I have realized that there is a significance to what is happening across the world.,It is important to be aware of what is going on.,and
44021_1,Basim brings up.,"His Christian friend cant go back to Mosul, not because he fears for his life.",Nan
43361_5,we are a mostly Christian nation it is hard to see that Christians could be doing all these dreadful things, it is hard to see that Christians could be a part of many horrific hate groups.,so
44526_1,We are able to see different perspectives people have.,We are able to learn different perspectives people have.,so
45982_1,A girl named Stacy asked him why he was not more angry about what had happened to him.,he copes with the horrible things that he has been through.,and
45804_8,They know.,They want to sway believers using false evidence.,because
45922_1,The example that Sam uses is a great example.,We are like fish in the water.,Nan
43618_3,If everyone looked at things from a different view there would be less controversy.,That is a very hard thing to do sometimes.,and
43962_4,I believe that to truly make change in this country we have to come together.,by kneeling during the national anthem you create an even greater separation.,and
45636_3,Sam made people look at America's history.,Sam made us look at America's history from a different perspective.,and
42950_2,This is something I cannot forgive our military.,every single life matters.,because
44342_1,One question sticks out to me.,How are you not angry?,Nan
46166_2,"n addition to what you said, I found it not wrong that athletes represented their feeling in the stadium.",I think their main purpose was not disrespecting military.,and
43508_2,Anything is possible.,These days it is really important to remember this.,and
45062_1,He brought many diseases to these people.,People had no immunity to the diseases.,Nan
42955_1,This is such a small request from us.,It is something we should already be doing.,and
44711_3,I thought he would be blaming all Americans for the loss of his relatives.,He did none of this.,and
45971_3,Black people did not have any place to go.,Black people had no property.,and
45304_7,I have never experienced these issues first hand.,I do not live with these fears.,and
45414_3,Most people here are Christians.,It is easier to hate.,and
44398_2,The internet is constantly showing videos of cops.,The internet makes people believe that thousands of unarmed black people are killed by cops every year.,and
44539_1,"In fact, many veterans are taking a knee.",They are allies for the civil rights movement.,because
43361_10,it is much easier to see people who are Islamic as bad., because some people who are part of that religion have done some dreadful things.,so
44558_5,We are being ignorant.,We are naive to was is really happening around the world.,and
43025_1,I think that everyone has a right to protest.,These athletes are protesting peacefully.,and
46128_1,We think they are covered all the time.,"They go on to explain how behind closed doors, in private, they were similar clothes to us.",so
44883_1,Blacks worked harder.,They reach social ceilings built by discrimination that impede their growth.,and
45921_1,The majority of the time we do not want to listen to the outside people.,In our opinion they are wrong.,because
44728_5,He is not angry at the Americans.,Anger doesn't solve anything.,because
46507_4,it really was a meaningful experience to both the people who participated in the activity., the people who watched.,and
42922_1,We are affected by the president more than people everywhere else In the world.,We are not affected to the extent we think we are.,Nan
45818_2,It was to have a conversation with women who don't.,It was informative.,and
45081_6,"By Muslims putting themselves in Christians shoes, than people are able to open there minds up to a more complex thinking.","By Christians putting themselves in Muslims shoes, people are able to open their minds up to new opinions.",and
46257_1,That is why I really appreciated this class.,it gave me a real look into what it was like to be a black person during those times.,because

45727_2,He had a lot of anger built up inside of him.,He had to just let it all out.,and
44998_1,We live in a mostly Christian nation.,We are biased towards thinking that Christianity does not have the same radical following.,because
44716_1,He learned.,That life goes on.,Nan
46333_3,I see the value in getting to know strangers.,I do not consider myself to be a very adventurous person.,and
43136_1,I feel like the best way to go about situations like this is promoting dialogues.,They foster productive discussions like the ones we have had with Bassim.,Nan
43232_3,It is like white policeman who shoot unarmed black men.,Armed black men have guns legally.,and
45745_1,White ancestors were at an advantage when most of corporate America was still racist.,White ancestors have been able to stay succesful. ,and

45306_1,I think there is only so much we can do to be understanding before we actually take action to make things right. ,I think there is only so much we can do to be understanding before we actually take action to make things truly equal for everyone. ,and
43456_1,Many individuals are exposed to negative depictions of the two clashing religions.,We begin to create some biased viewpoints about the situation.,Nan
45489_1,You could say you were proud of the southern work ethic which would be countered.,Southern plantations were arguably only successful because of the free and forced labor that slaves provided.,and
44735_5,They captured slaves who propelled the Africans' development.,They were eventually taking the native land in the Americas.,and
44548_5,His culture had to mix with non-native American culture in terms of his hair getting cut.,Him not having any connections to his family.,because
42859_1,We should all consider his message a sign.,we need to further educate ourselves.,and
42956_1,I heard Bassim talk.,It really opened my eyes to a lot of new things,and
43718_2,One usually participates in it as a result of their parents' customs.,Bassim really changed my views.,Nan

45231_1,This is just wrong.,It is a core detriment to we Americans as a people.,and
43582_1,I find that interesting.,It shows about how many unknown events there are going on.,because
43552_1,Our students should be more aware of what is going on in the world.,They should be more aware why the United States is involved in the conflicts that it is today.,and
46206_3,We can continue to ignore important topics.,We would stunt society's growth.,Nan

43787_2,We can try to put ourselves in their shoes.,We can try to understand that other people's reality could have been yours.,and
45031_2,It's why we fail to wrap our heads around this concept.,Most of us have never been exposed to other cultures other than our own.,because
45667_3,It might not register to you.,It didn't happen to the people of your color.,because
45378_1,I think its important.,We focus on the U.S. territories.,and
46199_1,A hijab never bothered me.,It is like a jewish person with a star of david.,because
42985_1,We are not truly shown the realities of life in many countries.,This is especially true in the Middle East.,Nan

44820_3,Basim chooses to turn the other cheek.,Basim chose to continue on being strong and living his life.,and
43123_4,This includes printing the flag on disposable items.,This includes using the flag to help advertise a product.,and
43699_1,We need to choose to learn about other religions.,We need to go through personal growth.,and
43015_2,especially those events that are going on in the Middle East.,its not that hard to form a negative opinion about people or things going on in other parts of the world.,so
45237_1,An NFL game is the perfect place.,Millions of Americans watch professional football.,because
45957_1,I really liked this exercise.,I think white people were better able to picture what it might be like.,because
43846_1,What we can do is educate ourselves.,We listen.,and
44413_2,There are Muslims who use their religion for violence.,There are Muslims who use their religion for hate.,so
46331_1,It was impressive to learn about the expeditions Mark Evans had gone on.,We learned the life lessons he had learned from them.,and
45820_1,Why do we get caught up in our differences?,We can't even have a normal conversation girl to girl.,so
46183_4,They are used to it.,I wanted to learn more.,so

43170_2,The fact that you are tired of seeing them killed.,Seeing them attacked at all.,and
43331_1,"Hearing Basim tell his story was a very emotional point in the class, I think, for many people.",its not often that you hear about how the American governments decisions affect real people and real families.,because
45412_5,Everyone nowadays is scared getting pulled over by a cop.,Cops' reputations scare people.,because
44674_5,Basim did not look to his religion for answers.,The man would be very different.,because
44611_2,Bassims people might have more of an appeal to Obama.,He looked more similar to them.,because
45374_2,Puerto Rico got hit by two of the largest hurricanes on record.,There's limited coverage of the aftermath.,and
45198_5,We know more about the world., science.,and
44122_1,There was harm and violence committed against people.,The people had the full right to voice their opinions.,Nan

43695_3,Our parents want to show us.,This is typically only what they believe.,and

44239_1,I admire Bassim,He forgave people that took away his heart and soul,Nan
44768_1,The blacks were so quick to defend the officer.,They see him as one of their people.,because

44667_1,I read a tweet. ,Don’t all white arguments sound ridiculous,Nan
46264_2,We should be more knowledgeable of what actually happens.,we could report true news.,and
44671_2, I have seen faithful people.,Basim seemed to be one hundred percent committed to his religion.,because

45706_1, I feel like we both felt the same way,We found it difficult to comprehend the role reversal at first,and
44215_2,Sam asked the class to imagine if someone came to war here.,Someone wanted our natural gas. ,and
45568_2,The fact is no surprise to these people.,They know.,because
43983_1,This is the statement I agree with most in the above response.,I believe it is our duty to be informed.,and
43759_1,Maybe one of the reason is that today the society is so fast.,We don't even stop a minute to reflect on a very simple concept like empathy.,and
43301_2,"By the year 2013, their wealth didn't double.",Their wealth was nowhere near the amount that white people made.,and

43396_3,Sam put up the statistics.,It showed more white people are shot by police.,and
45834_3,I'm being completely honest.,I was shocked to see more Caucasian people have been killed by the police than African Americans.,and

44977_6,I just stay set in my own ways.,I will never progress as  a human.,Nan

43771_2,"here in the United States when someone else becomes President, their polices are different from the previous President.",an assumption would be that the foreign policy for Iraq would be different,because

43557_4,It leads to people not caring about the events.,It's not happening in America.,because
45892_3,My brother was at Penn State visiting me.,He also sat in on the class.,because
43665_4,That the media coverage of the Middle East is negative.,That the good in all Muslims is never shown to the average Americans.,so
45262_1,There's a large amount of uneducated people in the United States.,It was very evident in the last election.,because
44935_1,I barely saw any hijabs in my area.,I never took the time to research why the women wear it,Nan
45547_3,Serfs didn't own land.,Serfs gave the ruling party most of their resources.,and
45667_2,It might not register to you.,It didn't happen to the people of your color.,and
43349_1,The way he talked about his wife just made it so much more real to me.,The way he talked about his kids in the message just made it so much more real to me.,and
42823_3,They might think we are all bad.,They have heard of the bad people who have participated in crimes in the name of Christianity.,and
46115_1,"Sadly, people don't have the same beliefs on this topic.",It is what divides our country.,and
43497_3,I never imagined that such a thing happened., There was barely any recognition.,and
44660_1,I thought this activity was super interesting.,It was very insightful.,and
45300_1,This is the lecture I appreciate the most.,It made me think.,because
45629_1,Neo Nazis represent a cultural ideology that shows hatred to any groups of people.,"Hatred to any groups of people are not white , Christian.",and
44455_3,Men forced women to cover up.,Women would not tempt anyone.,so
43191_1,"The United States can fly armed drones in a country, not currently a war zone.","The United States can physically fire weapons in a country, not currently a war zone.",and
45137_3,You will be able to understand why you are having conflict with them.,"Hopefully, you can find a way to avoid conflicts in the future.",and
45777_1,We continue to preach equality.,We continue to preach the land of freedom.,and
45200_3,Thats how wars were done back then,Blame white people for that. ,and
44678_1,You don't have to agree with them.,That doesn't mean you have to hate them.,Nan
45782_1,Imagine someone wanted to stand up for this oppression.,They were in fear for their life.,and
42790_2,They will always portray Americans as strong patriots.,They are risking their lives to save the world.,and
46031_1,It is always easier to show them that the wrong way is not the only way.,The right way is also beneficial to them.,and
44118_4,It makes us naive to those around us.,"Makes us naive ot the beliefs not being able to discuss religion, at a younger age especially makes us ignorant",and
43079_3,Work along each other to make a change. ,"This is not only affecting us, but future generations.",because
43449_2,"Religion, like many other facets of culture, can be hard to define.",Religion can fall victim to sometimes harsh opinions.,and
43401_3,There are plenty of people.,There is city life.,and
44991_9,They should take the time to look over the history of what happened.,It would be quite eye opening.,and
45851_5,The perspective on people's mind.,The arts that artists are producing.,and
44089_2,They were campaigning to save the world.,When they get to the office they find out it's much harder to do.,so
46370_3,We need to realize racism is an issue.,Racism is an issue that needs to be remedied.,and
45150_1,I dont believe that it is really forgiving the US governments minor accident., The US governments minor accident had devastating consequences on him.,Nan
45866_4,It helps  people to understand how society in the United States has unfairly treated black peolpe, incarcerated black people of today beyond committing a crime.,and
45281_2,Racism is most evident.,It actually largely .reminds me of some other things,and
43116_3,nowadays their children and teenagers were being brainwashed in a such a horrible way.,they want them to fight for themselves.,because
44857_2,They are living their life the way they want to.,Their hijab doesn't define them.,and
45147_2,I thought that this was something that they wore all the time.,I did not know.,because
45201_3,Blacks enslaved the poor Europeans.,They needed people to work the land.,because
43707_1,Every time your family has to go to the doctor.,You're going to have to figure out how to pay for it.,Nan
45084_1,I have never done an activity where I was a different race.,I have done an activity where I was a different gender.,Nan
42923_1,I recently got in a argument with my best friends mom.,She does not know but hears from society.,because
43210_2,it is not just because the politics of the system are unfair.,It's because they're dangerous.,Nan
45862_2,Black people had more in depth knowledge why the white people had historically thought of these crimes as okay.,They could explain why the white people had historically thought of these crimes as okay.,and
43621_1,He mentioned how there are people that work on cocoa farms.,They only get paid four dollars a day.,and
45012_1,Of course we're going to side with the media.,We see videos.,because
43277_1,I believe this class would mitigate racial conflicts.,It would mitigate ethnic conflicts.,and
44139_1,I mean he lost EVERYTHING.,"He was just an innocent man living his life with his family in his home, just like us.",and
43104_2,He has moved on with those feelings.,He has continued living his life.,and
46159_1,I wanted to answer the best way I could.,My view point was most important.,and
44934_1,As Basim shows there are those who are willing to work with Americans.,Why can't we go about it like that rather then with force?,Nan
43600_1,I would probably try to do anything I could.,I would probably try to get some sort of revenge on that government for harming my family. ,Nan
45363_2,Many people believe that politics should be kept out of sports.,I see where they are coming from.,because
45692_3,That can help inflict change. ,These tensions can grow. ,because
43988_2,We learn about Iraq.,It is just put into our heads.,Nan
43898_1,Hi Nicole!,I agree  with what you are saying in your post.,Nan
44042_3,There has been almost no media coverage at all.,This is going to the be the case.,and
42817_4,He made great American friends.,Americans were the ones who bombed his home on accident.,so
43137_1,Many Americans do not personally know any people from the Middle East.,People from the Middle East who are stuck in the situation going on overseas.,Nan
46282_2,"Statistics can lie, you cannot take them at face value always.",You cannot use them they are not a backbone of beliefs.,and
43944_1,"Had he stayed angry with the US, I wouldn't have blamed him.",That would be a rational response to the situation.,because
43962_5,I believe that to truly make change in this country we have to come together.,by kneeling during the national anthem you create an even greater separation.,and
46353_2,Call it their problem.,It's harder to act like an adult.,and
44800_2,You cannot understand a situation should you not be in a person's shoes.,I think this really did give everyone a taste of a flip flopped history book.,and
45113_2,Im just not sure why.,Someone would look at a black person.,and
44562_2,All he wanted was his family.,Both were taken from him.,and
45626_3,People don't realize how unequal things are.,Some people haven't been told how unequal things are.,because
45146_5,Hearing these women say they wear the clothes they do.,They essentially take pride in their religion ,so
45570_4,Sam flips the roles on black people.,Same flips the roles on white people in America.,and
43935_1,\ taking a knee., taking a knee.,Nan
43990_2,It is just a normal city being destroyed by hate.,It is much easier to feel sympathy.,Nan
45386_3,It put a spotlight on even how slaves were 'freed' from being held captive by whites.,there was still massive restriction that basically left them stuck at the bottom.,because
44338_1,I believe that Basim helped people realize that there are acts of war that will forever go untold.,It is up to ignorance of some people to believe that they do not exist.,and
44055_3,Even when they had the same qualifications as someone who is white.,Even if the white individual has a criminal record.,and
46459_2,it is considered public nudity.,"In most places a crime a woman to expose her breast in public , men can do so.",and
43919_3,They implement very different laws that affect the American people.,They implement very different laws that affect others around the world.,and
46019_1,Coming to college has taught me a lot about different religions. ,I have learned that there is beauty in every single culture religion. ,and
43822_3,i like it.,very useful,and
45477_2,I have more respect to them.,It shows how powerful these women are.,because
44066_1,I agree with you.,That technology has opened many doors for the world.,so
45812_1,If we stay in this rut we will be pointlessly killing,If we stay in this rut we will be pointlessly discriminating for no other reason than racism,and
44160_2,The statistics are vastly different than what we think.,Racial inequality is prevalent  in our society.,because
46327_4,That was the only opportunity they really had for work.,The laws that were created to keep them at the bottom.,because
42817_1,He went to school in America.,He made great American friends.,and
44624_4,There was a bias that only black people can play ball.,There was a bias that blacks were good at ball.,because
45954_1,I could feel them not feeling fully comfortable.,They were not making more than a general point.,and
43231_1,He calls the NFL players sons of bitches for protesting.,It is an amendment right.,Nan
45574_1,"In fact, it is the exact opposite of the story I knew.",I was taught the story in my previous years of schooling.,and
45390_4,African Americans had to ask permission from these employers to even leave these jobs.,Their employers had power,and
46372_1,White people definitely have a major privilege in this country.,I think that sometimes we can be extremely insensitive.,and
42773_1,I have so much respect for Basim.,I respect what he said.,because
42878_1,Erin said.,Everyone in the world knows what actually is going on.,and
42925_2,Many people in our society believe what is in the media.,What is told to them.,so
43901_2,I'm becoming more aware of the world around me.,I tend to look at news from countries other than my own.,and
44910_1,"Today, in church, my minister said that we are all followers of Christ.",Can we truly consider us followers if we do not love our brothers and sisters around us?,Nan
44089_6,When they get to the office they find out it's much harder to do.,They can't find a better solution than what's already in place.,so
46125_2,When looking at a Muslim woman wearing a hijab.,What does one think?,Nan
45821_1,The girls in Hijabs really took pride in themselves.,They took pride in their beliefs.,and
44935_2,I never took the time to research why the women wear it,I never took the time to research its meaning to their culture.,and
44160_1,I believe.,The statistics are vastly different than what we think.,Nan
46094_3,My religion guides me through my life.,I realized it when Basso made that statement.,and
42970_1,He is doing all that he can.,Other people do not have be in the position that he is.,so
43371_2,I know that other people have that type of mindset towards Muslims.,That is crazy to me especially after taking to Bassim.,and
44004_1,We see.,Black people are the only ones that are still oppressed.,and
44859_3,They draw attention to a movement they believe in.,Kneeling during the national anthem is not the right place to do it.,and
46391_1,Racism was a major issue this country faced.,Racism is a major issue this country faces.,and
44428_3,we need to see that it still was our ancestors., we have an extent of responsibility for what happened.,and
46477_2,Sam put them on the spot.,Sam asked them what they think about each other opinion wise.,and
43042_6,People in the U.S. are more likely to form negative generalizations about the people there.,They are not being understanding.,so
45231_3,Imagine if we do not open up our minds to the things throughout the world.,We will never grow as a people.,Nan
45103_1,It's really kind of you to put yourself in his shoes.,People should do that more often.,Nan
46346_3,They gathered together taking pictures.,"They are eating, laughing and even taking artifacts.",and
46205_1,Protestors want to bring this to society's attention. ,Protesters want other people to realize.,and
44212_4,I also feel responsible.,These are Aermicans.,because
43228_1,We need to actively seek out new from other places.,the bombing that killed Basim's family will not get forgotten in the background noise.,so
43985_4,I have learned a lot.,There is much more to learn.,so
45109_2,The switch is so hard to go along with.,It was just so extreme.,because
44099_3,"More frequently than not, we go in.",We make the situation worse than it was in the first place.,and
44491_2,I do not think I would have the strength.,I have to rely on my faith.,and
42787_2,people like Basim only wants peace,They want to simply live their lives without fear.,and
43208_5,Trigger happy monsters are protecting and serving.,the people they pick and choose.,Nan
43359_2,I hope that I will continue to grow.,I hope that I will become unbiased and objective in the future while still maintaining my values and important beliefs.,and
42947_3,it literally destroyed an environment.,I have never experienced the slightest bit of an attack.,because
44415_2,I do not share the same ideals as white supremacists in the South.,I shouldnt categorize any Muslim as part of the Taliban.,so
44702_6,It was intense.,It was impactful.,because
45897_1,Zack was telling me.,He thought.,Nan
43578_2,I personally do not know if I could continue to live.,I do not know if I could live if my family died how Basim's family died.,because
45135_4,Similar people with similar values will have multiple flash points of tension.,The tension will lead to animosity between them.,and
43737_3,It ismale-dominated but not completely.,Woman in the culture have rights.,and
43669_1,I believe parents should explain these various opinions to their children.,Parents should give them access to them.,so
44575_1,The question was how Basim views the different Presidents of the United States.,How Basim views from the time of the intervention in Iraq to present day.,Nan
44677_1,We all live different lives.,No ones experience is exactly the same.,and
45272_1,All of sam’s lectures get us to think about where we come from. ,We think about who we are. ,and
45058_1,It is great that many people are supporting Puerto Rico in this time of need.,It is great that many people are gathering supplies for Puerto Rico in this time of need.,and
43282_1,He explained that he felt he was kept alive for a reason.,I completely agree.,and
44956_3,This was probably the first chance of many others in the room.,"Sitting in discussion, I understood why many chose not to.",so
44198_8,It opened my eyes.,It devastates me to hear it.,and
42864_1,"If Basim was able to confront his past and move on to a brighter and better future, it is possible for us all to let go of our past.",It would be possible for us to focus on what matters.,and
43004_2,live your life by the suggestions in the Quran or the Bible or the Torah or whatever holy book your religion follows.,don't let it turn you into an asshole to other people who choose not to follow them.,and
45488_5,it was a a show of pride for their heritage.,the white girl said but what specifically are you proud of.,and
45901_3,We all need to be more aware of what is happening in other countries.,We all need to be more aware of what is happening in the world around us.,and
43698_1,"If we decide not to do this, it is our own fault.",It is not the fault of our parents.,and
45198_2,It's ridiculous.,We know much more than the common person did in the 1400's.,because
46203_2,Negative history has occurred in America.,People pretend.,and
45282_1,Foster children are most likely to be African American.,The case worker is racially biased a lot of the time.,and
45290_1,I've never thought to try.,To put myself in someone else's shoes in that way before.,and
45209_3,I think.,This is an extremely racist attitude.,Nan
43265_5,That is something., is certainly worth fighting for.,Nan
46476_4,They got to ask each other questions.,They got to hear each other out.,and
43309_3,I found this to be kind of funny.,Apparently at 18 years old we are old enough or I guess you can say even educated enough to vote for a new president.,because
46100_2,It was definitely a little confusing.,It was hard to follow at some points.,and
45525_1,The words he used to describe the Charlottesville march were violent and bad.,He claimed that the white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville had freedom of speech.,Nan
46003_3,We automatically shift blame towards the President.,It is easy to blame the President.,because
43599_3, a single person in my family., a single person in my family.,Nan
43050_3,He is matured.,He has intelligence that many in the world could benefit from.,and
42813_1,Police officers go through a lot psychologically to help society.,It just really frustrates me that there are people out there that will look at all police officers and question their intentions.,Nan
46132_1,"t school, we may have a dress code, specific guidelines to follow such as wearing shoes, covering private parts, not wearing racist, inappropriate clothing as well.",We have a dress code but not to the extent of the country telling me I would have to cover my entire body.,Nan
45141_1,I agree that we have to be able to have empathy to one another.," we all different upbringing , we all go through different trials.",and
43650_1,We need to be aware of the world around us.,There is much we do not know about it.,so
43204_1,Did an officer see that toy gun?,Did an officer actually think it was real?,and
45071_2,Bassim states that it is probably the biggest problem for the Iraqi people. ,This makes me wonder if our involvement in the Middle East caused this issue. ,and
45941_1,It was something I've never thought about.,It has been on my mind in the group discussions.,and
44298_2,Most people would hold much resentment.,Most people would want to demonize America.,so
46365_1,"Yes, it did happen many years ago.",we didnt do this.,and
45927_2,Some people aren't in the situation that we are in.,Sometimes we fail to understand what is actually going on.,because
44343_2,Everyone grieves differently.," If roles were reversed, I think I would be so angry.",because
44671_1,This was interesting., I have seen faithful people.,because
45914_6,It's awkward.,you know that you are being insensitive.,and
45271_3,It opened up their eyes to the fact that it is not just Muslims fighting Muslims.,Other religions do it too.,and
46100_1,We were forced to reverse roles.,It was definitely a little confusing.,because
44499_1,ISIS entered Mosul.,It changed everything for the people living there.,Nan
45249_1,I am an international student.,I am here at Penn State.,so
46309_5,Also a step backwards.,Since black people ended up in a difficult situation,Nan
44016_1,I realized It is because it is what was becoming normal.,There really isn't anything that he could do to stop it from happening.,and
46199_5,Nobody is forced to wear those things except the hijab.,that is strictly for women.,and
44967_1,I said previously. ,There are faults in both sides arguments. ,and
44304_4,They should really think about what they're doing.,They should really think about what their end goal is prior to taking action.,and
44791_1,I agree with very little of what our military does.,I still feel guilty for all the horrible things happening in other countries.,and
45012_5,We see headlines.,We immediately believe whatever is said.,and
45409_1,She had bruises up and down her arms.,She had marks on her neck.,and
45551_1,This began in the Tang Dynasty.,some slavery still lasts today.,and
43699_4,Personal growth isn't the job of our parents.,Personal growth is the responsibility we owe ourselves.,and
44415_4,I shouldnt categorize any Muslim as part of the Taliban.,They might share completely different ideals.,so
44102_1,"Specifically, Sam said that in past semesters, he has touched on different issues that were relevant to their respective times. ",Like we’ve been going over international issues.,Nan
45086_1,The men had to sit there.,The men had to pretend.,and
43832_5,Blaming a whole populace is not healthy., I respect him even more for this.,and
43108_2,It is often hard to picture a life without all the opportunities we have in America. ,It is often hard to picture a life without all the basic human rights we have in America.,and
44565_1,In high school I only had one world history class.,"It focused on countries like France, Japan, and Spain. ",Nan
42938_2,There were some he called his close friends.,Basim knew that our country did not intend for his tragedy to happen to him.,and
45210_6,The Black unemployment rate his higher.,The White unemployment rate is lower.,so
43579_4, I do hope they are more careful.,These are real people's lives at stake.,because
44868_1,"All I could think was, how can they be so stupid?",How can they be so blind to what is really going on?,and
46347_7,This hatred happens to young children.,This hatred happens to good people.,and
44821_3,We should not put everyone in a certain group., one persons actions.,because
45729_3,It was not benefiting him.,He realized it was time to let go.,so
44736_2,I feel like many people would not be fans of this conquest.,many people would only see the terrible nature of this historical fact.,and
43105_1,I guess.,what I'm trying to say is that America is a country with a lot of great opportunities.,Nan
44543_1,I had no idea about the boarding schools.,Boarding schools had an impact on the Native American culture.,and
45811_6,We cannot advance if we fight over religion.,We cannot advance if we fight over wealth.,and
43872_2,He then converted to islam.,He classifies as an atheist.,and
46129_8,Most of them like the clothes we are wearing.,it goes again policy in their country to wear such clothing in public.,and
42798_2,His friend was unable to return to Mosul. ,It was not because of his intense fear of Isis.,Nan
45113_4,Someone would look at a black person.,Someone would think. ,and
44422_1,"Every year the kindergarten class will get up in front of the entire student body, faculty, and parents.",They perform a native song.,Nan
44730_3,It was refreshing to hear Islam is a forgiving religion.,I heard about the violence the religion supposedly causes.,so
43300_3,This doesn't mean that civil society accepted this movement.,This doesn't mean black people were accommodated.,and
44344_2,I found his response to be humane.,He stated that his religion teaches him to forgive.,so
45496_1,I want to say that this response was extremely powerful. ,I couldn't agree more with what you've said. ,and
43364_4,We are all very similar.,Most people fail to pick up on our similarities.,so
45003_5,He did not use that disgust on neo-nazis.,He did not use that disgust on white supremacists.,and
46116_2,Sam took us deeper.,He explained in his unique way the way things occurred.,Nan
44273_2,It allows us work to help them with their problems.,We don't have to act as if their struggles have nothing to do with us.,and
43363_4,They are forgiving like Bassim.,They think to themselves.,and
44391_2,We profit off of outsourced low paying jobs.,The military's function is really just to instill fear into others.,and
43413_1,I also feel that politicians obviously are going to say what people want to hear.,They are going to say what will get you to vote for them.,Nan
43713_2,These people look.,These people look ,and
45356_3,No fly zones over major cities were implemented.,Pilots lock their doors.,and
43985_3,I have learned a lot.,There is much more to learn.,and
43545_1,I thought.,This clip was one of the best parts.,Nan
43208_2,There are very many of a certain thing.,There are very many trigger happy monsters.,so
45525_2,He claimed that the white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville had freedom of speech.,He rejected to identify them as neo-Nazis or white supremacists.,and
44473_3,Government individuals who represent our country have a moral compass.,We all need to do better.,and
46383_3,I feel that I have a better understanding to how my ancestors grew up.,"Insight into how badly blacks were treated in America, gave me insight.",and
46273_2,It is hard.,It is frustrating.,and
45796_1,I still agree with what the protest stands for.,I don't agree with the sudden flow of support for the protest.,Nan
44839_2,It is the job of a jury to remain impartial., It should judge based off the facts presented.,and
45833_1,The class you are referring to I enjoyed.,The class went through and gave us information first. ,because
44080_2,They all have the same policy of coming in.,They all have the same policy of ending the corruption in Iraq.,and
44214_3,Our primary motivations for going into Iraq was to get something.,That wasn't even ours.,Nan
46003_1,We have a misunderstanding of what the President does.,We automatically shift blame towards the President.,and
44707_3,I think that we should be more active when black people feel like they are not being heard. ,I think that we should be more cooperative when black people feel like they are not being heard. ,so
44805_1,I find it pretty extreme.,I find it not too exclusive considering their religion and laws.,Nan
43520_1,In the world today it is easy to see what other people are doing wrong.,We do not see what we are doing.,and
44865_1,I was sitting in the audience during this lesson.,It was hard to not find it comical.,Nan
45418_3,Just one person in my family died from something so tragic I would not be able to cope for the longest time.,"All I would be able to think would be, Why couldnt it be me?",and
45452_2,It makes me more mad.,"The best we could do was offer him $2,000.",and
43332_6,It was a bombing by the American government that went awry.,It was never supposed to hit Basim's house.,and
43630_1,I believe a lot of the world issues can be mitigated if we all make an effort to try to understand each other. ,It is truly a learning process.,Nan
42967_1,"To be honest, listening to Basim talk, I tried putting myself in his shoes.",I tried asking myself what I would should something like this happen to me.,and
44419_1,That is why I think it is important that we in the United States stop having prejudice against Muslims,That only feeds the hate.,because
45363_4,I see where they are coming from.,It may be a way for them to get away from politics.,because
43295_2,where Sam talked about Black Devils.,where Sam talked about Racial Supremacy.,and
44644_2,This was interesting to me because I have always seen myself as not contributing or elevating to racial problems in society today.,"In reality, by not speaking out against it and educating myself on the injustices, I am playing a role in the problem.",Nan
43279_4,I enjoyed learning about their cultures.,I feel like it isn't talked about as it deserves to be.,because
44060_3,To have empathy you have to put yourself in someone else's shoes.,To have empathy you have to deeply try to feel what they're going through.,and
46190_1,There are many things people can do to disrespect this nation.,I do not believe these football players.,Nan
43504_3,It is so easy to assume things about people from another religion.,It is so easy to assume things about people who look different.,because
43532_3,You believe it or not.,Influence is high based off media.,Nan
46319_2,The issues that dominated our society will only help us come to resolution,The issues that dominated our society will only help us to fix these problems.,and
43731_1,many of the stereotypes about.,Sharia law is from the people.,Nan
44103_2,Sams excitement about certain issues definitely stems out to the class.,I think its crazy he he tries hard to reach the issues from many different angles.,so
43166_3,The media portrays many more unarmed black deaths by police.,Blacks push for their stories to be heard.,because
45067_7,They say they'll make the situation better over in the middle east.,Basim said that there has been no notable difference between the policies and actions of those in office.,and
42845_3,I never took the time to step out of my shoes.,In to another person's shoes.,because
45744_1,Sams key driver is that slavery is not something to be taken lightly.,We cannot simply just move on.,and
46076_1,Our government decided voting early on.,A majority of black people could not vote under our government.,so
45953_2,White students talk about oppression.,White students talk about struggle.,and
45804_3,They actually don't believe it.,They know.,and
44923_2,It is necessary to be aware.,Bassim  said.,Nan
45674_1,They are the lawmakers.,They can just make laws to keep it very similar to slavery.,so
43557_3,It leads to people not caring about the events.,It's not happening in America.,and
43864_1,I feel like there is such a societal political standard for what is expected of the president.,Often times citizens find themselves not pleased with the president they voted for.,and
43825_4,i like it,very useful,and
43029_2,They are kneeling now.,They did not join Kaepernick last year.,and
44638_2,He was guided to forgive.,He was guided to move on.,and
46152_1,I gain strength like Bassim.,I gain wisdom like Bassim.,and
45724_1,I'm not too sure why.,The history really is different to me.,Nan
42959_2,Basim respects Americans.,Basim does not hate the United States.,and
43340_6,"Hopefully, ISIS will eventually leave.",I wonder how Iraq will even begin to mend the damage.,and
42892_2,There are many good ones too.,We cannot forget that.,and
45367_2,Following that class I actually talked with my mom about the topic. ,I usually don't talk politics with her to much. ,because
43221_4,There are many loopholes.,That can be discovered in their pages link.,so
42791_5,It is only natural for us to easily forget. ,and be preoccupied with our own personal lives.,Nan
44899_3,I would be consumed by anger.,I could not even consider forgiveness.,and
43561_3,It shows that our country needs to step up our education.,"As a general society, we need to be more empathetic to world tragedies.",and
45227_4,It is our responsibility to develop our own stances.,It is our responsibility to not take those that are being laid out in front of us.,and
43449_1,"Religion, like many other facets of culture, can be hard to define.",Religion can fall victim to sometimes harsh opinions.,and
45892_1,I enjoyed this class.,My brother was at Penn State visiting me.,because
45850_1,I learned that history matters a lot.,I learned the person's perspective on people matters a lot.,and
44259_1,I can say for myself I was pretty lost when I first heard of some social issues.,Social issues like the bombing in Mosul.,Nan
43841_2,Go learn.,Go live.,Nan
46283_1,"I am not saying that statistics has no value, but I am saying that we have to be aware of where those numbers came from.",Who compiled that data and for what reason.,Nan
43784_1,I completely agree that we tend to always see others as less than what we are.,We tend to pick out other people's flaws a lot more than the ones we have.,and
43525_2,This is a country founded upon religious tolerance and religious freedom.,We cannot create laws that are based on a single religion.,because
42989_1,"We have many refugees and immigrants here, both legal and illegal.","They came from around the world, and lost everything.",Nan
42993_1,"In that case, I believe they must utilize the resources.",They do have to inform themselves about their world.,Nan
44460_1,This idea is wonderful.,It helps women be confident.,because
43230_3,He has been vocal about reforming Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).,"He calls them names, especially illegal immigrants,",and
46309_1,You think the civil war was a step forward.,Slavery was stopped.,and
44619_1,Basketball traditionally is played in cities.,It is so easy to set up a basketball park.,because
45819_1,I really liked this activity.,"It just seemed like a bunch of girls hanging out, having a normal conversation.",because
46106_2,I think that it definitely opened my eyes up to what has been going on for centuries,It continues on today,and
44207_3,It was their property.,"It was their income, etc.",Nan
44904_1,I learned that is has already been ten years. ,The place is under all kinds of conflict. ,and
42872_1,It really is an amazing opportunity to listen to Sam. ,It really is an amazing opportunity to listen to what he talks about. ,and
43265_4,It isn't harder being black in America than it is for white people.,That is something.,and
44645_5,"There are people who still see black people as less than a person than white people, which is completely absurd. ",but it is an injustice within society.,and
43286_2,My dad went to school in Poland.,My dad knows everything about its history.,and
44553_7,I wish they at least took into consideration families like Basom's.,"Like you said, these are real people's lives at stake.",and
44282_1,However I agree with her.,Not all police officers should be generalized in a negative light.,Nan
46500_1,The toll it takes on a population to live that history is brutal enough.,To know it doesnt even get acknowledged is unimaginable to deal with.,Nan
45899_2,I now can be more respectful.,I now can appreciate the differences between the two races.,and
45642_1,"My thought had been they struggled with role reversal, did not know what to say.",They had a hard time trying to figure out what to say.,and
43147_1,Some argue that ISIS grew.,They grew to these numbers after the US decided to pull out.,Nan
45145_1,That was not the case.,Sam pushed do not be politically correct.,and
45293_3,I think.,That excuse is used all the time when talking about slavery.,Nan
46414_2,Those who did not attempt to flee the scene were mostly White people.,"Those who were unarmed were mostly White people (8 White, 4 Black, 4 Hispanic, 1 other).",and
43661_5,"the Middle East is not being exposed to their actual culture, belief, or way of life we are naive",the Middle East is believe what we are told.,and
44304_1,Its very true that what countries decide to do has a lot of impact on individuals.,They should really think about what they're doing.,and
45844_6,I do not understand.,Empathy allows me to try seeing another point of view.,so
44099_2,They feel it is their duty to be the world peace keepers.,"More frequently than not, we go in.",and
44540_1,I was never taught any of the things we discussed about in class in high school before.,This is very new knowledge to me.,so
45181_1,There will always be those who believe blacks aren’t equal. ,It’s just their skin pigment that is different. ,and
43684_1,It's an important lesson for everyone to learn.,It could lead to a lot of problems being solved.,because
45456_1,"I remember seeing a while back, a study was actually done to see how fast false information could be spread on social media.","I can't remember the actual stats, or who conducted it.",and
44234_1,This is where I can say I agree with Sam Richards.,So many Americans are being hypocrites.,and
43154_1,Chaos brings viewership.,Viewership brings advertising dollars.,Nan
43206_5,Tamir Rice was killed because he matched the description.,A 12 year old boy.,and
45206_2,"First, I understand why Sam wanted to switch roles.",He made the black people pretend to be white.,and
45046_1,That was said in this class that day., that might sound like the ideal thing.,and
44933_7,Why not try to negotiate?,Why not do things more peacefully?,so
42823_4,They might think we are all bad.,They have heard of the bad people who have participated in crimes in the name of Christianity.,because
46335_1,I do not think there is one best way to learn something.,It varies a lot on what their best way of learning is.,and
43198_1,We live in a country in which you are allowed to carry.,"We live in a country in which you are allowed to open carry, in some instances.",and
45831_3,His strength is inspiring.,I hope that he will be able to share his story with more Americans.,and
44549_1,"I think that in the direction our country is headed, I just feel bad for Native American people.",They're misrepresented in the scheme of the United States as a whole.,so
42958_1,I think that everything Basim has gone through is beyond inspirational.,I think that everything Basim has overcome is beyond inspirational.,and
46189_1,To touch on the taking a knee when the national anthem plays.,I think that it is a peaceful protest.,and
43805_3,Football is one of the most popular viewing spectacles in the United States.,That is exactly what it has done.,and
45482_3,They do not drive cars.,Men are being made to grow a beard.,and
44922_1,I agree that it is sad to hear that other countries are more aware than the United States.,I think that is something we need to work on.,Nan
43610_2,what we learn can be skewed.,the media doesn't always tell us everything we need to know.,and
43019_3,It influenced my negative view of this place,Now I see the place differently.,Nan
43295_1,I have linked the full lecture from September 14.,where Sam talked about Black Devils.,and
43794_1,Sitting is considered disrespectful. ,Why is printing on plates not considered disrespectful?,and
45147_1,I had ignorance about women wearing hijabs.,I thought that this was something that they wore all the time.,because
44103_6,His lecture covers almost covers every single angle.,It  reaches every single student sitting in his lecture hall.,and
46269_3, people are treated differently due to the color of the skin.,"It was peoples ancestors who did it, we are responsible to fix the issues , they are still happening in the present.",because
45331_1,He was a great figure who carried himself well.,He caused a lot of social policies that I agreed with.,and
44857_1,"The last comment one girl made who wears a hijab every day said that her hijab doesn't stop them from doing anything,",They are living their life the way they want to.,and
45486_1,It was interesting.,All the volunteers were regurgitating things that they have said.,because
46454_3,Cultures are different than mine.,It is important to ask questions about subjects.,and
45734_3,One third is full of people who want equality.,The last third does not care about anything.,and
46059_4,He swore to make the world better.,and safer place.,and
43479_1,I feel a certain way.,My entire life is a certain way.,Nan
44667_2,Don’t all white arguments sound ridiculous,It sounds crazy. ,Nan
44570_3,They fail to lend attention.,Other countries are equally as worthy.,Nan
44521_2,I think the media sugar coats.,What is really going on around us?,Nan
44860_3,The game is really all in good fun.,"To me, the national anthem does not preach any kind of white supremacy. ",and
43555_2,In today's society we have technology.,It is so easy to be informed.,Nan
44198_9,It devastates me to hear it.,see all the problems in the middle east.,and
43986_1,There are many bad perceptions of different places in the world., We can choose to believe them.,and
45600_3,They did not notice the inequality of black people.,This has shifted to the violence some police officers inflict on black people.,and
46342_1,Here's what many people do not realize.,Consider the regular citizen.,Nan
43602_3,I believe it is more due to the many innocent civilians.,That we have accidentally killed in the Middle East. ,so
45073_2,That there are people of the Christian religion.,Who are bad people.,and
43304_1,Let's take an example.,Jared Kushner got accepted into Harvard.,Nan
44417_1,One guy who killed a young woman.,Injured 19 others is not very different.,and
46189_2,I think that it is a peaceful protest.,theyre trying to make a statement.,and
45580_2,It probably caught many people off guard.,They were making all of the negative comments.,Nan
43857_3,"The way in which they are being done is unfair, disrespectful, and immoral.","There are better times, places, and ways to affect change.",because
45079_3,You look at yourself.,Others would look at you.,and
46037_3,My family has endured.,My family lost so much through out the war currently happening on the part of the world.,and
43186_4,It would allow us to be more knowledgeable of what is happening outside this country.,It would allow us to be more aware of what is happening outside this country.,and
46257_5,it gave me a real look into what it was like to be a black person today.,I got to see it in a whole new perspective.,and
43327_2,he lets Islam guide his life so.,his life so.,and
45811_1,The human species cannot advance if we continue to segregate.,We cannot advance if we fight over race.,and
43101_1,I was born here,I was raised here,and
44795_4,Sam described the treatment of the whites was mind boggling.,It was seeing another side of the story,and
43897_3,We are awakened to reality.,We see what we've all been missing out on all this time.,and
43340_1,The war will eventually end.,"Hopefully, ISIS will eventually leave.",and
44658_1,"By starting a precedent of acceptance, we can pave ways that future generations can see a person about who they are.","By starting a precedent of acceptance, we can pave ways that future generations can see a person not based on where they are from. ",and
45497_1,What was shown on the board was the complete opposite.,I would have guessed.,Nan
43171_1,Many of these players have every right to kneel.,They will continue to do so with or without the constant badgering of the President,and
42939_1,Basim went by his knowledge and experiences in the war.,He could see we don't all share the same wants and beliefs,Nan
44753_6,Many people thought they were totally different.,They really weren't.,and
45047_2,This type of class is very nontraditional in lectures.,Facts were not read.,because
44325_1,People would be very upset hearing the story of Basim's family.,The media sometimes does not publish these stories. ,and
43362_6,We think about that.,We say they really aren't Christians to ourselves.,and
45739_1,Our generation should be responsible.,"Our generation should strictly condemn those who think their race is superior,",and
45010_1,I've always believed the media can cause us to believe issues that simply aren't accurate.,The media can cause us to side with issues that simply aren't accurate.,and
45920_3,That people from the outside have different beliefs.,We tend to believe.,so
42898_1,"Taylor, you did a great job capturing the thoughts and emotions.","I am sure most of us, if not all, felt the same during this lecture.",Nan
43939_1,I feel.,Many Americans at the time felt.,Nan
43214_1,they are purposely vague.,"to be questioned, because.",and
46369_1,When people hear black people talk about this topic.,They say that they need attention.,Nan
43499_1,I'm not saying that these issues are not important.,Other issues should be brought to light.,Nan
43919_1,They have different views.,They implement very different laws that affect the American people.,and
44729_2,He stated how he is not angry.,His God teaches him to be forgiving to those who wrong him.,because
44158_2,This question is hard to answer. ,I think political people just put on a show. ,so
43995_4,We should see them like the families they are.,That is how we will move away from stereotyping.,and
43779_2,There are some news sources that try to stray away from this tactic.,The job of the media is to create stories for their demographics.,Nan
45216_2,By the end of this class I feel like I am now more empathetic.,I  am more aware of what other people around the world have to go through.,and
44301_3,The tables were turned.,Some troops from the middle east came to America.,and
43597_4,He tells us what the United States government did to Basim.,He tells us what it did to his family,and
44764_2,It made them feel safer.,It made them more comfortable.,and
43913_1,The lesson that I learned in this class will forever be engrained in my memory.,I will take The lesson that I learned in this class with me wherever I go.,and
43953_3,I have lost count of how many times American professors have spelled it Columbia.,I have lost count of how many times Americans have asked me if my family is part of the mafia.,and
46271_1,I have realized  many things in the first half of this semester from this class.,The major thing that I have learned is that it is  important to have empathy towards people.,and
44714_2,He lost the love of his life. ,He has learned to forgive. ,Nan
43131_2,Not everyone HAS to agree with this. ,If someone wants to protest during the national anthem by silently putting their fist up or taking a knee then let them.,because
42798_3,It was not because of his intense fear of Isis.,His entire family has relocated .,because
44492_4,Basims life was turned upside., he lost everything but he was still able to find his spark.,and
45914_4,It's difficult.,It's awkward.,and
44864_2,I know about slavery.,I know about oppression.,and
42975_8,that means there was possibly something that made him think of it.,That means this idea that we have about equality and fair treatment for everybody isn't real.,and
43890_1,"In fact, he mentions.",They are considering reducing wages.,and
45601_3,There is still a problem with racism in the criminal justice system.,There are plenty of videos.,and
44818_3,Basim had been bombed in America.,Everyone would have known.,and
44252_1,Apply Islam to your life.,It will make your life better.,and
45179_1,I think that there is racism today.,There always will be.,and
44212_3,I also feel responsible.,These are Aermicans.,and
45141_6," we all different upbringing , we all go through different trials.",Tribulations  that's why we should be more open to the world.,and
46294_6,I am not embarrassed or ashamed of it.,It is still kind of distracting to me when I am around new people.,and
45607_3,I believe that more people should really get to know all the rules.,I believe that more people should really get to know principals of other religions,and
43064_1,"Out of the seldom times the media reports on the Middle East now, unlikely are we to ever hear about the issues.",Unlikely are we to ever hear from the perspective of the ordinary person.,Nan
44240_2,We are confused how Basil forgave these people. ,Try and speak to the Americans as if we didn’t destroy his life. ,so
43292_5,We should try not shop there., its less expensive.,and
43604_2,Due to these instances.,I do hope they are more careful.,because
46266_1,It is key to make a difference,is key to follow Bassims final words of advice,and
44223_1,Sam was able to reverse the roles.,Sam was able to put us in the shoes of Basim.,and
44580_5,I'm an American.,The last three Presidents are catastrphically different from one another in many different facets.,because
44773_3,"At the end of the day, white people wont.",Most white people see no benefits.,because
42936_1,Many Americans are quick to judge the Muslim religion.,They do not know any Muslims personally.,because
44601_1,It is intriguing to see now.,No one knows how long the protest will continue to go.,because
44923_1,This is important.,It is necessary to be aware.,because
45520_1,I really understood.,I agree with your point.,and
45819_2,"It just seemed like a bunch of girls hanging out, having a normal conversation.",It is how these types of things should be.,because
44499_2,It changed everything for the people living there.,It converted everyone to radical Islam.,Nan
44080_3,They all have the same policy of coming in.,They all have the same policy of ending the corruption in Iraq.,because
46053_1,We should have faith in the system.,We don't have to have faith in the judicial system.,Nan
43431_2,They make judgments about these different religions.,"They often times creates stereotypes against other groups, such as All Muslims are terrorists.",Nan
44418_1,Hate is everywhere.,It cannot be blamed by religion.,and
44541_2,It is so recent.,It is so tragic.,and
45863_3,The white people could only base themselves on surface knowledge.,The only people could only base themselves on things that were presented in the media.,and
46489_1,The roots that African American people in this country have were planted in a time.,They had no way to grow as a community.,Nan
46361_6,I listened to them.,it made me see what happened many years ago in a different way.,and
45649_1,This stuck with me.,It was probably the key time during the class.,because
43508_3,These days it is really important to remember this.,Pessimism will make us angry. ,and
45108_2,There were 3 black people.,They tried to justify their wrongdoings to the 3 white people.,and
43127_5,Everyone follows the national anthem.,Everyone follows the pledge of allegiance without ever questioning its meaning or history.,and
45521_2,I feel like in the past few years it has been unfortunately a brought up topic.,It's how the media portrays it.,because
43774_1,I thought this interesting. ,Education isn't improving.,and
45145_2,Sam pushed do not be politically correct.,There was nothing negative said from either group (Muslim women or American women).,and
45466_2,It really showed how ignorant actual white people were during the Civil Rights movement.,"The tradition of discrimination America was founded on, is deeply rooted into the government and social mindsets.",so
44419_4,That only feeds the hate.,That only feeds the tension between us.,and
46476_1,This class was awesome.,Sam brought up a few women wearing hijabs as well as a few girls who did not.,because
45889_3,I found it interesting as well. ,the true blacks are actually still dealing with racism to this day.,because
43896_3,I've relied so much on the opinions of my elders to drive my thought process.,How I should react to certain things.,and
42799_1,ISIS was able to bomb civilians homes.,There was nothing to be done about it.,and
45014_2,It's time we start looking deeper into things.,We start looking deeper into things to prevent us from going into even more confusion and violence.,and
44241_2,He said he felt that anger would just eat him from the inside.,Anger is something that has the ability to take over people's minds and actions.,Nan
45636_1,It was interesting how Sam had our class switch roles.,Sam made people look at America's history.,and
45951_1,However the black students could say it.,I think opened up the whole class for more honesty.,Nan
43292_2,They profit off of foreign labor like what Bassim mentioned.,They don't have safety regulations.,Nan
45178_4,The white families confused me.,The black families confused me.,and
44212_1,I can’t help to feel sad. ,I also feel responsible.,and
43842_1,Make your voice heard. ,Speak for those who cannot.,and
44866_5,Listening in on this lesson I felt arrogant.,Listening in on the lesson i felt naive.,and
45119_3,People want you to think that more black people are being killed by police officers.,It is the opposite.,because
44586_1,I really enjoyed your response. ,I agree that all humans should possess empathy. ,and
44108_3,I know I personally don't watch the news.,The news is always talking about the bad things going on around us.,because
46458_1,In some cases they are forced by their government to wear their Hijab. ,In other cases they wear it truly because they want to. ,Nan
45273_1,I did think it was interesting.,It was interesting to see the situations of these different races flip flop.,Nan
45394_5,Black people talked like modern day white people.,Their statements epitomized what uneducated white people sound like.,because
44672_4,Most of us could not control what the government does.,Their forces do things to other countries.,because
46428_1,Not just on the material being discussed.,The facts I knew already.,Nan
46197_6,We alone are the only ones who can judge ourselves. ,We hold ourselves to our own standards that we see fit. ,and
44428_5, we have an extent of responsibility for what happened.,but how we are going to help mend it.,and
45435_5,All 5 of the hijab wearing women laughed.,All 5 of the hijab wearing women agreed.,and
43837_1,Americans learn this.,It is all the news is telling them.,because
45457_1,That really opened my eyes to the media.,They focus more on things.,and
46103_1,I never gave the topic much thought.,I was not on the receiving end.,because
43896_2,"In the past, I've relied so much on the media.",I've relied so much on the opinions of my elders to drive my thought process.,and
44847_5,It was awesome to hear what the girls had to say about wearing hijabs.,It was awesome to hear what it means to them.,and
46350_1,That is just how I am.,I treasure my family higher than anything.,because
44645_3,I am definitely someone who has said that the past is in the past and that black people are progressively getting more equality.,That statement should not be said because I know that their history goes back to slavery.,because
45215_1,Her dad was having trouble getting a job on wall street.,Her dad was facing intense racism.,and
43481_2,That shows different situations.,That shows different cultures.,and
45067_5,Consider what we're often told by those in/running for office.,They say they'll make the situation better over in the middle east.,and
43314_1,"Bassim mentioned we don't have any excuses, anymore.",We live in a time where being/staying connected with people is easy to do.,so
44226_4,We villainize the Muslim population.,It is a few thousand.,and
45726_2,He was not angry with Americans.,He was not angry at life in general.,and
44361_3,Radical Muslims will do horrible things.,They end up making the headlines.,because
43337_2,it ultimately came down to each candidates character.,"it was an easy choice considering one of the two candidates was and is still racist, sexist, and homophobic.",Nan
44954_5,Some offered the idea that they did not feel educated enough due to the bias in media.,and the candidates focusing more on attacking their opponent than promoting their campaign.,Nan
43007_1,"Knowing myself, I also think that I would struggle to forgive.",I would struggle to move forward after such a tragedy.,and
45504_2,It opened the eyes of many individuals.,Individuals that don't think there is a difference in the way blacks are treated.,and
44138_1,It happens more often than not.,"Innocent people like Basim are stripped of their families, pets, homes, and belonging.",Nan
45067_6,Consider what we're often told by those in/running for office.,They say they'll make the situation better over in the middle east.,and
43736_3,East in the laws make.,all we hear about the Middle.,and
43657_2,Those images started spreading fast.,"Eventually, the whole world start seeing these. ",and
45439_1,The women actually seemed surprised.,Other people thought thats how they felt.,Nan
44039_2,People assume that every single one is done by Muslims.,Islamic radicals like ISIS take credit.,and
45487_6,You could see how comfortable they were in their body.,they were saying those things because they had heard them almost all their lives.,and
46210_2,They're not protesting our troops.,There are always people out there who want to cause drama.,and
44630_4,My mom apologized for forcing me to do something., I did not feel was my place to do.,Nan
43405_3,We Americans are always very quick to point fingers at others.,We don't even own up to our own mistakes.,so
43322_5,We call their ideas weird.,We call their ideas backwards.,and
43665_2,You can't help to feel bad.,That the media coverage of the Middle East is negative.,so
44615_1,The biggest American issue in Iraq is oil.,The biggest American issue in Iraq is increasing our profits from the resource.,and
44955_3,I turned 18 in September 2016 and I always looked forward to this birthday. ,I knew I would just make the cut to be legal to vote. ,because
43944_3,That would be a rational response to the situation.,Basim is truly an extraordinary person.,because
43774_11,Health care isn't improving.,Pensions are not improving. ,and
46175_2,"He told me to look, thus looking back it now at 4:38 second of this video,",the synchronization is quite funny,and
42962_1,He is a true role model in my eyes.,He is someone who is so genuine.,and
45589_1,This system is flawed.,Something needs to change.,and
44991_10,It would be quite eye opening.,helpful to most people who live in a community of different ethnicity together.,and
43332_2,No one should ever have to go through such a huge loss in his family.,It was a bombing by the American government that went awry.,because
42839_2,I realized it when he told us about the man from South America.,He would work 20 hours a day on a coca farm only to make 4 dollars a day.,and
44785_1,I think we need to learn more about other people.,I think we need to learn more about their cultures so that we are more connected with others.,and
45119_1,This is interesting to me.,People want you to think that more black people are being killed by police officers.,because
44002_1,We live in a world.,It is so easy to judge.,Nan
44271_1,Basim's story was really impactful.,It showed that he was able to see past those who killed his family.,because
46405_6, I will refer to white people black people like black people,t flipped like in the lecture to reduce confusion.,and
44807_1,It all does seem strange to me.,It all does seem extreme to me.,and
46271_6,The major thing that I have learned is that it is  important to have empathy towards people.,It is  extremely important to see things from different perspectives.,and
43291_2,It is outrageous,we should try not to support slavery like this,and
46174_1,They were absolutely wonderful.,it was interesting to see their perspective about wearing it.,and
46071_1,Former slaves had to resort to going back to plantations.,There was no where else to go.,because
44289_2,These people have suffered.,These people have struggled enough.,and
44620_3,In northern regions you see a lot of hockey arenas because it is so cold.,"Back before our modern technology colleges could only go to areas to search for recruits and players, that would end up becoming professionals.",and
43509_1,He suggests the fact he converted to Islam.,He could not believe in evolution.,because
44647_6,Black people are persecuted.,discriminated against for the color of their skin every day.,and
43463_2,Our nations security is definitely of the utmost importance.,I am in no way saying we should not be cautious.,and
44808_1,It's a completely different way of life.,I think that it would be such an inconvenience to always have to be aware of who's around you should you be wearing a hijab.,and
43678_1,One reason is that he was in the United States.,"He saw the people were friendly, harmless.",and
43386_4,Black people are still projected to earn much lower amounts of money than white people.,Black people experience less steep financial growth.,and
43318_1,Some political commentators call Kaepernick unpatriotic.,They are the same ones who wear the flag on their t-shirts.,Nan
46133_1,I personally would be annoyed with my government.,I do not believe that they have the right to tell me what I can do with my body.,because
42820_1,I am a Christian.,Something baffles me.,and
45702_2,I never thought they were a big deal.,They were not directly affecting me.,because
42848_1,It is a sad thing to see.,I believe that empathy and a change of perspective will give people the ability to see the people different than how they are portrayed to be.,Nan
43717_1,There is a big reason I am not religious.,I've never really seen how it could actually change a person's life.,because
44952_5,There would have been complains regardless if Clinton were elected.,There would have been complains regardless if Trump was elected.,and
43591_5,Basim is forgiving. ,The unimaginable happened to Basim.,because
43342_3,We want him to say Iraq can be as beautiful as it used to be.,"It is simply isn't realistic, not in the foreseeable future.",and
43297_1,This lecture was intriguing.,Sam flipped the script on history.,because
45400_1,In class Sam showed a bunch of facts.,Whites are 3.5 times more likely than blacked to be killed by police.,Nan
46409_1,The other disadvantage of having the lecture set up this way is that it makes it very difficult for whites to be able to defend themselves.,It would be very easy to chalk up their claim as being racist.,because
43481_3,That shows different cultures.,That shows different religions that I know nothing about. ,and
43081_1,They need aid from people that will help them evolve.,They need aid from people that will help them build their lives how they want to in order for them to be in peace. ,and
46405_5, I will refer to white people black people like black people,t flipped like in the lecture to reduce confusion.,and
44375_1,Obama did not end the war.,Trump does not make it seem like he is planning on changing that anytime soon.,and
44492_3,How  is he not angrier?,Basims life was turned upside.,and
42818_2,There are real people and families out there.,They are not all that different from us.,and
45200_4,Blame white people for that. ,You have to do the the same to the Chinese and Africans who slaughtered people for land in the 1400's.,and
46106_3,I think that it definitely opened my eyes up to what has been going on for centuries,It continues on today,and
46418_1,"The history of America is full of injustice, racism, does not mean American's are that way.",Someone should not be determined by their ancestors. ,and
44818_4,Everyone would have known.,Maybe even the government would get involved.,and
45541_1,Things don't have to stay bad.,we have the ability to make them much better.,so
43375_2,We just have to learn about the world from an unbiased perspective.,Which I think that Sam tries to do.,Nan
44234_2,So many Americans are being hypocrites.,They talk about Muslims in such a harsh light.,and
43953_1,I am from Colombia.,I have lost count of how many times American people have spelled it Columbia.,and
45562_2,It is likely that I think this.,It is the prevalence of social inequality in our country.,because
45224_2,People have to be aware of the world. ,Not just aware through the eyes of the media. ,and
45365_2,I could see how it could be disrespectful for the military/people in the service.,They put their lives on the line every single day.,because
44758_4,They did not slut shame them.,It must have been an eye opening humbling experience.,and
45599_1,It really emphasized how big of a role the media plays now with our government.,It affects such wide margins of people.,and
45577_1,"But by flipping the roles, I was actually able to put myself in the shoes of a black person.",I feel how I would feel,and
44443_2,They promote their own.,They put the black businesses down.,and
43920_1,I know each President has different views on the war.,Each President wanted to implement different strategies.,and
46339_2,It's great to see.,Many options are out there for us to learn more about the world around us.,Nan
44606_4,That raises the question of protesting not being right.,It is right.,and
43579_2,The United States will not stop doing airstrikes., I do hope they are more careful.,because
43204_2,Did an officer actually think it was real?,Did an officer actually think their life might have been in danger?,and
45955_3,They have never felt it.,They could never really understand it.,and
45284_2,There are statistics to prove that.,There are factors that go unnoticed.,and
45879_1,Empathy is a powerful thing.,It can be hard to have.,and
43716_1,It would have tainted my view of people.,That weren't associated in the conflict at all.,Nan
43740_1,I commend Bassim a great deal for this very mature response.,I commend Bassim a great deal for this very respectable response.,and
44323_2,Basim helped the class understand.,Not everyone is lucky.,and
43659_2,It talks about some of the falsification that was put on a group of people.,The falsification was a result of a few peoples action.,because
42842_3,I felt a part of me wanting to show more empathy,I felt a part of me wanting to be more concerned and aware of what happens outside of the United States.,and
46174_3,One of them saying that it gives you a different perspective because your not worried about yourself and able to look out in the world without so much worry.,It gives you a perspective to see the world with less concern and less fear.,Nan
45488_3,one group said that it was not a show of racism.,it was a a show of pride for their heritage.,and
42842_2,I heard what Bassim had to say to the class.,I felt a part of me wanting to show more empathy,and
45069_3,We are still involved over in the Middle East to better the situation over there.,I heard what Basim had said.,because
43361_4,we are a mostly Christian nation it is hard to see that Christians could be doing all these dreadful things, it is hard to see that Christians could be a part of many horrific hate groups.,because
44982_4,They should be able to believe in whatever they please.,They should be able to believe in whoever they please.,and
45393_1,"These people (many of them, for that matter) did not have adequate education or preparation for the work industry.",to expect them to be able to be able to beat out competition (with many people who were still incredibly racist) is so unethical.,and
43962_2, the national anthem  creates a sense of patriotism.,I believe that to truly make change in this country we have to come together.,and
46396_1,I also thought it was very interesting.,The white people were reacting and commenting.,Nan
44752_3,He makes us talk about them.,We truly understand.,and
44363_5,Most of us have Christian friends.,"We can say ""Oh wow those Westborough Baptist people are crazy.""",and
45177_2,To put myself in a black person's shoes.,To see what they had to go through. ,and
44799_1,What if history decided that black people had white slaves?,What if history decided that black people had segregation against white individuals?,and
45105_2,I see how this man doesn't let his anger corrupt him.,It is truly remarkable.,Nan
46414_1,Those that were killed were mostly White people.,Those who did not attempt to flee the scene were mostly White people.,and
44457_1,I think it is because I was not educated on the origin of the Hijab.,It is because I have ever bothered to ask a woman with a Hijab.,Nan
45123_1,I think these misconceptions can come from a simple lack of communication.,Lack of communication with people we're not used to.,Nan
45967_2,It would inspire people to become better.,It would inspire people to do something.,and
44148_1,If the situation were flipped I think we'd hold a grudge with the opposing country for quite awhile.,"If one of our houses were bombed, I think we'd hold a grudge with the opposing country for quite awhile.",and
44415_1,I am Catholic.,I do not share the same ideals as white supremacists in the South.,Nan
45397_2,One thing i will say is that.,Some police may be racist against blacks.,and
43327_6,he lets Islam guide, guide his life so.,Nan
45923_3,we see it from the outside we are not always expose to it.,We tend to know more about it.,because
44032_3,The bomb claimed his home.,It claimed some of his close family members.,because
43578_1,I pray for people who share the same situation as Basim.,I personally do not know if I could continue to live.,because
46203_3,People pretend.,We are a country focused on promoting freedom.,and
45338_2,It is disrespectful to the men and women who have served.,Plenty of Americans loop up to the flag.,Nan
45513_1,Basim was put in an unimaginable situation.,His home was destroyed.,Nan
42840_2,They are treated unfairly by their government.,We should be more aware of these issues.,and
45258_1,I became more motivated to learn more about this issue.,I became more motivated to advocate it.,and
46345_1,Sometimes no reason was even needed.,They just sacrificed a life in order to keep a people in their place.,Nan
42926_1,There is a huge part of an issue.,The huge part of the issue is about my hometown.,Nan
43021_1,We wouldnt want to associate things like that with our own land., It would make us look bad.,because
43954_1,I find it astounding.,Geography is an important course in our early education.,and
46147_5,I felt the anger was just gonna eat me from the inside.,Anger was hurting me more than it was benefiting me.,and
43443_1,I was always able to brush it off with the justification.,It just being one small group of crazy people who were extreme.,Nan
43851_1,They are exploiting that people are going to tune in to watch regardless.,they are making a plea to an audience that had no say in whether they wanted to listen.,so
44924_1,Many people are similar in ways we dont think of.,We are quick to judge on things like appearance.,because
44749_2,The syllabus lays out everything you could ever need to know about class.,"The syllabus lays out exams, home works, topics, and chapters to read.",Nan
46160_1,I truly believe.,We ourselves define who we are not what we wear.,Nan
43604_4,That they are more accurate.,because these are real peoples lives at stake.,and
44414_1,It is interesting to compare both religions.,You realize that religion is part of who you are.,and
46305_2,The black doing the same thing as if they were white was very eye opening to me.,it was much more exciting than a regular lecture about black history.,and
44063_4,I was never really taught about it.,I never really was taught to care much about it.,and
44770_1,The whites were pleading for the blacks.,Try to see the event through their eyes.,Nan
43312_1,I find that sometimes we are so wrapped up in its own little world.,We are not even aware of what is going on around us.,Nan
46091_1,I was angry for a few months.,I felt the anger was just gonna eat me from the inside.,and
44841_1,Yes people are wrongly killed.,A loss of a life is a loss of a life.,and
43148_3,We really wanted to.,One thing is for sure....these Iraqi's didn't deserve this kind of life.,Nan
46376_1,It happened long ago.,That doesn't take away any of its importance in our country's history.,because
43206_2,Tamir Rice was 12 years old.,Tamir Rice was playing in a park as any 12 year old would.,and
44070_4,Who are they to tell me what I can do.,and cannot do.,and
44720_2,It helped me to put myself in the shoes of a Muslim person.,It emphasized the tragedy.,and
44882_3,It was the white male with a felony.,They were hired more than a black male with a clean record.,Nan
45663_1,That happened to my country.,My friends and family were killed.,and
43525_5,We cannot create laws that are based on a single religion.,Not everyone practices the same religion.,so
44268_1,This has to have been one of my favorite lectures from Sam Richards.,It spoke upon the hidden hypocrisy of everyone in America.,because
45598_2,Sam pulled up the statistics.,Many unarmed black people were shot and killed by the police.,Nan
45298_3,Truly diving in is nearly impossible.,Understanding what exactly you're supposed to be seeing is nearly impossible.,and
44520_1,I never learned about serious issues that happened with the American culture.,I feel like that was done purposefully.,and
46022_1,I believe the media focuses on this issue more.,The media focuses on the issue more than natural disasters.,so
46059_3,He swore to see out the law.,He swore to make the world better.,and
42850_1,it make feel.,i feel good,and
45732_3,It would be best to eventually let it go.,It would be best to learn to forgive.,and
45321_1,It is interesting how the world works.,How we are linked to people all around the world.,so
46274_1,I listen to a lot of Christian rap music.,"One of lines that always stands out to me is from Andy Mineo's song ""Now I Know.""",and
43525_3,This is a country founded upon religious tolerance and religious freedom.,We cannot create laws that are based on a single religion.,so
45946_2,Police brutality needs to be stopped nation wide.,Too many innocent lives are being taken.,because
44871_1,I think race is a topic that people tend to ignore.,it is a sensitive topic.,because
46384_1,Throughout school you are taught about slavery in the United States.,I dont think that the textbooks often give what happened justice.,Nan
44253_3,He is a Muslim.,His religion says he must forgive others.,and
44599_1,There's another side of the argument.,They are not disrespecting the flag.,Nan
45155_1,He described his life story. ,I am forgiving because of my religion. ,Nan
42802_2,The conversation regarded black lives matter.,The conversation regarded blue lives matter.,and
46495_1,Hearing the class about Native American history was so eye opening. ,We only learned the positive side of that era.,because
43637_1,"Therefore, it is of the upmost importance that Americans learn more about other people in the world.","Therefore, it is of the upmost importance that Americans learn more about other people , through our media.",Nan
42871_2,Never. ,We live in a bubble. ,because
44276_1,In class this week we discussed the blue lives and black lives movement. ,It allowed me to better understand both sides. ,Nan
43661_2,the Middle East is always killing each other.,"the Middle East is not being exposed to their actual culture, belief, or way of life we are naive",and
46371_1,Some people saw an attack.,The attack was on white people.,and
43053_2,She was raised there. ,She got married to my grandfather who is a Saudi. ,and
46260_1,Racial inequality is a huge issue today.,Our country does not get the recognition that it needs.,and
44243_3,"Love others, letting go of any hate you harbor inside.","How Bassim has the ability to do that, he has my utmost respect.",and
45003_1,I was appalled to hear Donald Trump diminish the NFL.,The players kneeled during the national anthem.,and
44398_3,The internet is constantly showing videos of cops.,The internet makes people believe that thousands of unarmed black people are killed by cops every year.,and
46295_7,I don't have to think about whether people are looking at my scar.,I can just be present in the moment.,because
44117_4,There is value in being morally sound.,In most religions many people fail to accept that.,and
43329_1,The amount of strength and faith a person has to have to be able to overcome the murder of the majority of his family without feeling anger or resentment is absolutely absurd., I cant fathom how he was even able to do so.,and
44666_1,I was on twitter quite frequently through this whole class.,I wanted to see something.,because
46294_4,I am proud of that scar.,I am not embarrassed or ashamed of it.,and
42960_3,"He came out on top, optimistic.",He is not filled with anger.,and
44074_2,Then it is one person's  or a group of people's interpretations that determines what happens to someone.,It does not use facts.,and
42788_1,No one wants to be in war.,I believe it is the greed.,Nan
44292_2,The average American thinks we significantly helped the Middle East.,They think we made everything much better.,so
44102_4,It is definitely just a reflection of how important these issues are. ,and their effect on the society that we live in today.,Nan
44400_1,There are obviously some police officers who are biased.,Some police officers are quick to judge which is wrong.,and
45742_3,Sam controls the conversation.,Sam moves on.,and
45018_5,It must be frustrating when white people don't understand their perspective.,they don'ttruly know what its like because they have notexperienced the kind of discrimination that they have.,because
44707_2,I think that we should be more active when black people feel like they are not being heard. ,I think that we should be more cooperative when black people feel like they are not being heard. ,because
44795_6,It was seeing another side of the story,"seeing that first hand in the exercise, I definitely empathized more than I realized I would.",and
45487_5,You could hear the emotion in their voice.,You could see how comfortable they were in their body.,because
45994_1,President Trump is everything wrong with this country.,He needs to be held at a higher value.,and
43041_1,I think it is easy for people to form generalizations about people who are different from them or live in other countries.,There is usually a barrier separating them from being more empathetic towards that group of people.,because
44188_2,I think it’s due to Christianity being the norm in the US. ,It’s what the majority of the country practices. ,because
44328_1,We are much more.,We are more than the labels we put on.,so
45412_3,I believe almost everyone nowadays is scared passing a cop.,Everyone nowadays is scared getting pulled over by a cop.,and
44924_2,We are quick to judge on things like appearance.,We don't judge on what is on the inside.,because
44538_1,This kneeling could be a call that a whole race is hurt.,The players are honoring that. ,and
45363_1,Many people believe that politics should be kept out of sports.,I see where they are coming from.,and

43657_3,"Eventually, the whole world start seeing these. ",The kids grow up seeing this only makes the situation worst.,and
43940_1,It showed the war.,It was from the perspective that is far too often ignored.,Nan

44397_2,Social media plays a huge role.,Young Americans receive news and information.,Nan
44110_2,We do have to talk about the bad things going on.,We do need to stay informed on the bad things going on.,and

45492_3,Lawyers are required to have a bachelors degree. ,Lawyers attend an extra three years of school.,and

43981_4,having those morals is not something that should shut one down from the thoughts.,having those morals is not something that should shut one down from opinions of others.,and
45520_3,I agree with your point.,The media talks about police brutality.,and
46079_1,I saw things in a different perspective.,I hope that other people can see post slavery reconstruction in the same way.,and

42845_2,I never took the time to step out of my shoes.,In to another person's shoes.,and
42817_2,He went to school in America.,He made great American friends.,so
44297_2,People that cared for him.,People he cared for the most.,and
42845_4,In to another person's shoes.,Who may be feeling discriminated against or have been living their life in fear everyday,and
43050_4,He is matured.,He has intelligence that many in the world could benefit from.,and
43881_1,Both religions have posers who say they’re doing whatever they believe in for their faith.,Both religions have posers who say they’re doing whatever they believe in for their religion. ,and

45146_1,A lot of people think that Muslim women wear hijabs.,They are forced to rather than them wanting to,because

44926_1,We are able to see past the stereotypes.,We look at people for how they truly are.,and
44606_6,It is right.,"No one should be getting killed by the cops, being unarmed.",because

45162_1,I went up to the Muslim students.,I asked if I could wear a hijab.,and
43960_2,I'm not sure if this was one of the videos.,We were allowed to respond to.,because

43500_4,People have many misconceptions of the island.,The have never learned about Puerto Rico in high school.,because

44798_2,:iving in the shoes black people did during those times is humbling.,"It's completely startling, knowing that situations could have easily been flipped had history been opposite.",and
44149_2,Basim has moved on.,Do you really ever move on from such a tragedy?,Nan
45001_1,People are afraid of Muslims due to their religion. ,They should also be afraid of Christians. ,because

46038_2,It will help us better understand each other.,Maybe the military should be required to learn about the culture of the countries they enter.,and
44223_2,Sam was able to put us in the shoes of Basim.,"Basim had lost his wife, daughter, brother, nephew, dog, and house due to an American bomb.",and
46307_3,It was really hard to succeed in that context. ,They lacked the experience to actually thrive after the civil war.,and
45421_2,Say we reverse history.,it is the white people who feel oppressed,and

46353_4,It's harder to act like an adult.,It's harder to actually resolve the issue.,and
44751_5,I think too often it's easy to walk away from a political conversation.,I think too often it's easy to never actually talk about the real problems.,and
44419_5,That only feeds the hate.,That only feeds the tension between us.,because
45707_1,It opened my eyes.,White people imposed horrors on slaves.,and

45356_2,Transit police forces increased.,No fly zones over major cities were implemented.,and

44178_3,Something like that happened to me.,I would not be able to forgive the people who did that to me.,and
46072_1,Plantations were messed up.,Destructive physical harm took place on plantations.,so

43191_3,"The United States can physically fire weapons in a country, not currently a war zone.",There is nothing stopping the US from flying these drones over every country in the middle east.,and
44875_1,I have learned about the hardships that blacks had to face.,They are facing it.,and
43363_5,They think to themselves.,People who associate with the Taliban aren't Muslim.,and
45522_3,"This topic is constantly being brought up,",People should have a better sense of the black lives matter.,Nan

45635_2,it is important to spread awareness about what happened in Americas history,It is important to make sure people know the real story in regards to slavery in America,and
45920_2,That people from the outside have different beliefs.,We tend to believe.,and
45902_2,People do not know.,Myself included.,and

42782_2,Imagine I was at his position.,my family have literally been taken away from me over a matter of a few seconds.,and
45069_1,This surprises me so much.,Here's what we are taught to believe.,because

44686_1,We're all different.,We see other parts of each other that make us friends.,Nan

45659_1,News channels do not show a white person being killed by a police officer.,News channels do not have to show white people being killed.,Nan
44175_1,It is up to us.,To actually go and research on our own.,so
43528_2,It's hard because it can be interpreted in so many different ways.,Everyone will take away a different message.,and
44534_2,Many people are overlooking the fact that this take a knee movement is about the injustice in America.,People are disrespecting others. ,because
44385_2,Basims home was bombed by accident which killed his wife.,"an accident killed his daughter, brother, and nephew.",Nan
45182_8,"At first, I think they found it hard to get into character.",They found it hard to find something to say.,and
45913_1,"I know not everyone is like Sam, its really difficult to ask questions that might offend people.",how do we stop having these thoughts  they arent dispelled by the people who have lived?,and
46261_1,I personally feel that racial inequality is such a great issue in this country., The people who created slavery never owned up for their wrong doings.,because
43816_1,Pick up the bible.,Read the Quran.,Nan
43848_1,Their unfair efforts are not the most ethical way to accomplish their goals.,They should stop being backhanded and sneaky.,because
44664_2,I was feeling upset about how the black people had treated the white people throughout history.,I always ended up remembering that the roles were reversed.,and
45364_2,They look at these athletes as their role models and superheroes.,These athletes know that there is no better place for them to voice their opinions then on national television.,and
43875_3,"They stand for far right political practices, and want to be the dominate race.","They are not considered a terrorist group, because they're white.",Nan
44787_1,I think Basim is an amazing person.,Everyone should try to think about the struggles.,and
43232_5,Armed black men have guns legally.,because guns are indeed legal in some states).,and
46461_3,Female breasts are very different than male breasts.,Female breasts are more sexualized than male breasts.,because
45935_3,Most people don't think about it.,Most people don't believe it.,because
44378_1,"all of these politicians are acting exactly the same as the last one,.",it has to come down to the people of the United States to call.,Nan
43098_1,I wanted to include the other video about Bassim's feelings about America,I believe it ties in with the previous one,because
45500_2,People say they want change in the media.,We fail to recognize real individuals devising these stories behind the scenes.,and
44033_2,It's something embarrassing that we did.,It is an act that can be easily brushed under the rug.,and
45814_2,"Yes, there are dangerous people.",There are people who follow a plethora of religions.,Nan
44070_3,Why do I have to listen to someone who I cannot feel.,Who are they to tell me what I can do.,and
45208_3,I believe.,Switching the sides only made the matter much more difficult to understand.,Nan
43625_3,I was able to have access to that.,I have met many people from different cultural backgrounds.,so
46311_3,I couldn't believe the statistics showed in the slides about the present.,I couldn't believe the projected statistics about the future.,and
43981_3,I understand it is important for people to have their values.,having those morals is not something that should shut one down from the thoughts.,and

42838_3,They do not understand them.,It is not happening right in front of them.,because

45797_1,We don't know who is behind the cause. ,We don't know who is protesting. ,and
46262_2,There is not enough education in this topic.,It's hard for students who have no real knowledge of this issue to understand how important it is to talk about these types of things.,so
46059_2,He swore to protect people.,He swore to see out the law.,Nan
43109_2,We are better off than people in countries like iraq.,they have been negatively affected by ISIS..,so
44442_1,The black guy said that he doesn't have to.,His parents served the country.,because

45416_2,"The terrorist attacks that are happening in Uganda, South Sudan, CAR and the democratic republic of Congo are horrible.",I feel like what unfortunately happens is media doesn't cover those events.,Nan
45540_3,We can educate them about where the United States has gone wrong in the past.,We can teach them about ways it can be better in the future.,and
46085_1,hey were at such a low point that African Americans had to go back.,African Americans had to work on the plantations that the white people owned.,and
43661_1,As Sam has mentioned many times we are told that the Middle East is always at war.,the Middle East is always killing each other.,and
44353_1,Americans turn a blind eye to something like this.,That is  t negative.,because
44738_1,The African American students make comments about slavery such as it was a long time ago.,I don't know why you can't just get over it.,Nan
43715_1,"Personally, I would have been angry with the country.",I would have been angry with everyone associated with that country,and
45799_3,we hear Muslims killing Muslims.,we judge their culture from afar.,because
44736_3,many people would only see the terrible nature of this historical fact.,many people would only see the terrible nature of this historical fact if the perpetrators skin was a different color than your own.,and
44796_4,We learned about it in school.,This exercise made me feel like one of them.,and

46042_1,I was surprised.,Being angry was bad for him internally.,so
45647_3,White people are behind in society.,They were words.,because
43277_2,It would mitigate ethnic conflicts.,"They stem from information we gain online, not directly.",and
44621_1,The NFL used to be a majority white.,Where they were selecting players.,because
43746_1,it make feel good,it make feel good,and
43133_2,they want people to pay attention to it.,The best way is in front of thousands of people watching a sporting or entertainment event.,and
45831_1,His forgiveness is inspiring.,His strength is inspiring.,and
43772_2,i like good.,Another thing I found interesting.,Nan
45388_3,Many were not given access to schooling or quality education of any kind.,Many black people were not literate and lacked the skills to thrive in these fields.,and
42871_6,We don’t truly understand what we are. ,We don’t truly understand who we are. ,and
42867_1,We see these people as terrorists or killers,They look at us and feel the exact same way.,Nan
42811_1,many people will just listen to the media,"They may not think twice about it, myself included.",and
45852_1,I hope many people in the class learned.,I have learned.,and
42908_3,They caused a lot of pain.,They claimed it was in the name of Islam.,and
45862_4,They could explain why the white people had historically thought of these crimes as okay.,They could justify why the white people had historically thought of these crimes as okay.,and
45785_1,I value this class so much.,We get to hear stories.,and
43114_6,They dont think about terrible things.,theyd ever done terrible things to the community.,and
44130_1,There are people all around the world who are just like us.,We can never see this.,Nan
45197_3,There were already people here.,He named those people Indians.,and
44775_2,It is because white people do not care. ,They do not have to. ,and

45287_1,The person who was in control of the bomb that destroyed Basim's house will probably never know thedestruction they caused.,The person who was in control of the bomb that destroyed Basim's house will probably never knowthe pain they caused Basim.,and
44110_4,We do need to stay informed on the bad things going on.,We need to be informed on the good things going on.,and
42815_3,Through social media. ,That Afghanistan is just some war zone. ,and
44699_3,This class has really changed that.,I have learned how to empathize more with people I cannot relate to.,and
44593_1,We do not realize the things that are happening around us.,We are very self-centered.,and
43986_4, We can choose to believe them.,We can decide ourselves what is true.,and
46450_2,I automatically would've assumed.,Women wear hijabs.,Nan
45567_1,A lot of Americans give George Bush a lot of hate for his actions abroad.,"The fact that a man who lives in one of the countries George Bush occupied with US troops says he sees no difference between him, Obama, and Trump, is eye opening.",Nan
44228_1,Groups like the Alt Rigth and Ku Klux Klan call themselves Christians.,They are truly the ones filled with hate.,and
45304_8,I have never experienced these issues first hand.,I do not live with these fears.,because
44808_3,I think that it would be such an inconvenience to always have to be aware of who's around you should you be wearing a hijab.,I think that it would be such an inconvenience to always have to be aware of who's around you should you not be wearing a hijab.,and
43872_3,He classifies as an atheist.,I  thought that was cool.,Nan
46513_1,I really enjoyed this class.,It showed hijab for what they are.,because
43494_1,My hopes are that President Trump will be able to manage this ongoing situation in the Middle East.,both parties can heal and grow from what has been an ugly period of war.,so
42975_4,He can just decide one week what he wants to bring up in class.,that means there was possibly something that made him think of it.,and
43023_2,We know that KKK members aren't Christians.,We shouldn't assume that the people killing people in the Middle East aren't Muslims.,so
43485_1,This class has already had an effect on me by forcing me to talk.,This class has already had an effect on me by forcing me to think about stuff that I wouldnt do if I werent taking this course.,and
46501_2,There are grave sites where people are building infrastructures on.,That would be the most disrespectful thing to their ancestors who lost their lives.,and
43939_2,Many Americans at the time felt.,The war was unnecessary.,and
46369_3,They say it was years ago.,Today there is equal opportunity.,and
46038_6,it could stop many tragedies from happening.,and many lives would be saved.,Nan
43182_3,This makes American look like a super hero coming into a country.,This is definitely not the case for !/:/8@,and
45520_6,The media talks about police brutality.,Some people think that it is talked about too much.,and
45276_2,I saw proof of the white people peacefully protesting.,The black people rioted because of it.,and
43539_1,I also feel that this class is definitely opening my eyes to many cultures.,I also feel that this class is definitely opening my eyes to many religions,and
46162_2,He told me to look.,Looking back it's at 4:38 second of this video.,and
43230_4,"He calls them names, especially illegal immigrants,",as if his ancestors came here legally.,and
46282_1,"Statistics can lie, you cannot take them at face value always.",You cannot use them they are not a backbone of beliefs.,and
45195_1,Take what you learn.,"Try to use it to make some sort of impact, no matter how small.",and
46020_3,People are focusing too much on this issue.,There are many other things that need to be brought to the attention of the public.,so
45244_1,There is hypocrisy of course on both sides.,A significant amount more coming from the critics in my opinion.,Nan
44119_2,Sunday Schools should touch on these topics more during their lessons.,They should just keep student's minds open.,and
43119_4,It all depends on persons perspective of how they see religion.,Thoughts about different groups of people.,and
43564_1,It was sad to hear and see.,The city has ended up being now.,and
45270_4,The comparison was an interesting one.,It made me think about what really happens in the world.,and
44744_2,It is easy to find out information.,It's on the tip of our fingertips.,so
46321_1,"When slavery ended, the white people had everything.",black people had arguably less than they had before.,and
45413_2,You actually researched an issue that you felt strongly towards.,Rather than just relying on what was said in class.,Nan
45074_2,One can't say.,All Christians are bad and violent.,so
43031_3,There is a racial divide in America.,We need to do something about it.,and
45241_4,what he did is not disrespectful toward the flag.,"Others do(use it  clothing, napkins, laying it flat horizontally, etc",and
44930_4,It leads to unprovoked violence.,Our country has already done enough damage.,because
43173_3,I'm surprised when Sam mentioned that Bible didn't explain details of use of alcohol.,I'm surprised when Sam mentioned that Bible didn't explain details of women's rights.,Nan
42798_4,His entire family has relocated .,and he had nowhere to go.,because
45485_1,"Overall, I agreed with everything you said.",I appreciate your open opinions towards these issues.,and
45164_3,It's due to scripture 1 Corinthians 11:5.,"It says, ""Every woman who prays... with her head uncovered dishonors her head.""",because
44466_1,I always figured a bombing would need to take a lot of planning.,I always figured a bombing would take careful execution.,and
45536_1,I guess being ignorant of history taught me a lot about racism.,By talking about racism today we are only increasing the divide.,so
46179_4,To understand from women who do wear hijabs that they do it for themselves.,They want to wear it.,because
44023_4,It makes me question them acting in our best interest.,They are willing to jeopardize people's lives to profit economically.,and
45205_2,White people's power in the past set them up for advantages today.,Any race could have ended up on top.,and
45914_5,It's difficult.,It's awkward.,because
42838_1,Some people do not see these issues clearly.,They do not understand them.,and
45930_3,They brought clarity.,The roles could have been reversed to easily.,and
43867_1,I appreciate the 3 branch system of our government to make things just.,Do they always make their final decisions for the good of all of the people?,Nan
43076_1,Many governments are corrupt. ,The people who suffer it are the citizens. ,and
44096_1,I am a Democrat.,I believe.,and
43019_2,I worried about my parents being deployed there,It influenced my negative view of this place,and
44117_3,There is value in being morally sound.,In most religions many people fail to accept that.,and
45031_1,Here's part of the reason.,It's why we fail to wrap our heads around this concept.,Nan
46216_2,Sam said that this was not a class to miss.,The mystery of why had me wondering up until class.,and
46309_3,Slavery was stopped.,Also a step backwards.,and
46395_2,It was still a new experience for me.,To be hearing everything that happened as if it happened to my people.,Nan
44715_4,There was no reason for him to stay angry., the anger would just consume him.,because
45304_1,It is easy to say that the cop was protecting himself.,The cop was doing a white person's job.,and
43903_2,They need to start to look at other countries and places.,They need to understand the hardships they have there.,Nan
45102_2,"War is very harmful, not just to our soldiers.",War is very harmful to the people we attack in other countries.,and
44277_1,"In the media, you only see the negativity.",That comes from both of these movements.,Nan
44182_2,He said he is not.,It was many Americans who have helped him after the tragedy in his life.,because
45023_4,It is important to be aware of what is going on.,It is important to not be indifferent.,and
44843_3,We should be taking interest in how they are living.,It is highly possible that there are many things we can do to help.,and
45736_2,Dr. Richards did a fantastic job at extracting the information.,Dr. Richards displayed it back to the class in a unique manner.,and
45973_3,They had to sign a contract.,This contract made black people not able to do things freely.,and
45935_5,Most people don't believe it.,they don't have to face it daily.,because
46027_1,the reason those white students have enough points to argue in this exercise is.,they have heard so much about why racism is wrong.,because
46203_1,People tend to want to cover up.,Negative history has occurred in America.,and
46097_1,I may have a hard time forgiving.,I turn to religion for support.,Nan
43242_1,I really do think that it can be an issue when it is forced onto us to wear.,In that instance it's not our choice anymore.,because
46003_4,We automatically shift blame towards the President.,It is easy to blame the President.,so
45147_3,I did not know.,When women are around other women they dress the same way as women in America do.,Nan
45039_1,Many people have a narrow minded view of how the world is today.,This is due to the environments those people live in.,and
45423_3,There is racism in employment.,The issue of equal opportunity is alive.,and
45282_6,The case worker is racially biased a lot of the time.,The case worker believes there is more trouble at home than there actually is.,because
43777_5,They think we are their enemies. ,They think we have somehow wronged them. ,because
44653_2,What people wear could be a huge part of their identity.,It is important to let people feel comfortable.,and
45923_1,Fishes are always in the Water  they do not really know much about it; unlike us.,we see it from the outside we are not always expose to it.,because
43687_1,Another thing I liked about this moment in class was that he mentioned his religion. ,He mentioned how his religion would want him to forgive. ,and
43466_4,To get to engage in dialogue with someone.,From a culture that is different from our own. ,so
45601_5,There are plenty of videos.,There are statistics that show evidence of this fact.,and
45434_4,They wear bikinis in their homes.,They wear them around only women.,and
46319_1,having conversations that cause people to debate.,The issues that dominated our society will only help us come to resolution,and
45942_3," police brutality, killing black people",its interesting to look at the statistics of police brutality,and
43122_1,I felt like there must be something that we can do to support them.,We should express a message to the government.,Nan
43722_1,I think it is very important for people to see this.,It shows a lot of strength.,and
46169_1,He said was that it was going to be great.,He asked me to get a couple of scarfs.,and
45645_2, I never really put much thought to this topic,I've never thought about it until this class. ,so
44927_3,I left that lecture feeling very complicit in the acts against all the many families like him.,It was done by our country.,because
46347_3,This hatred does not happen to dangerous criminals.,This hatred happens to young children.,and
45882_3,I found this activity interesting.,It took our preconceived notions about race.,so
44959_1,Is it inevitably impossible for them to make a difference in matters like foreign affairs?,Is it impossible for them to make a difference in matters like those Bassim spoke of to our class?,and
43939_4,The war was unnecessary.,The war was immoral.,and
45622_4,I hope people have the ability to forgive. ,"Myself, I will try to forgive those who might hurt me in the future. ",so
43691_1,It's important people understand that that is not true.,It is only a small percentage.,and
44694_1,Stories are being spread about the violence of groups following the same religion you do.,News reports are being spread about the violence of groups following the same religion you do.,and
44860_4,"To me, the national anthem does not preach any kind of white supremacy. ",or seem insensitive to the sufferings of black America.,Nan
44352_1,"A country came, accidentally bombed someones house.","A country came, accidentally bombed someone killing their family.",and
44450_4,We continue to turn a blind eye.,Who are we to say we are better than the people bombing towns?,and
45608_2,I believe.,Our ignorance causes most of the hatred and anger in the world.,Nan
43889_2,We are closing ourselves off to new outlooks.,We are closing ourselves off to new perspectives.,and
44981_3,you've made some very valid points regarding freedom.,he right to be able to believe in whatever you want.,and
46160_2,We ourselves define who we are not what we wear.,"It was our personality, traits, characteristics, or even actions.",Nan
45414_2,It is particularly a difficult situation in the USA.,Most people here are Christians.,because
43183_3,The main thing that I have taken from it is how the news outlets are biased.,They are steered towards either the left or the right.,and
44902_2,The US army invaded Iraq.,The US wants to get control of Middle East.,because
44585_2,I cannot relate.,I understand why he has those sentiments towards the United States.,and
45967_1,The world would improve dramatically.,It would inspire people to become better.,and
45917_2,We do not really know what is going on.,We are in the situation.,because
43206_4,Tamir Rice was playing in a park as any 12 year old would.,Tamir Rice was killed because he matched the description.,and
43159_2,Crazies who make their own interpretation.,Crazies who use it to excuse violence.,and
46011_3,It affects the group that is doing the oppressing.,They may think that it is a problem.,and
45217_2,I had never put two and two together.,I didn't associate the United States with the issues in Iraq.,Nan
43077_1,They promise to aid the people,They promise to change the way of life,and
43131_1,I can see people not agreeing with this.,Not everyone HAS to agree with this. ,because
45732_5,It would be best to learn to forgive.,Basim did.,and
45618_2,That will only cause more tragedies happen.,To forgive his enemies there is no other way that will benefit not only him,because
44243_4,"Love others, letting go of any hate you harbor inside.","How Bassim has the ability to do that, he has my utmost respect.",and
45182_1,"Trying to play opposite roles, the students took turns trying to talk about their history.","At first, I think they found it hard to get into character.",and
44498_1,I sometimes do not think Americans thought all this through.,The problems caused because they wanted Iraq's oil.,Nan
45482_2,They do not drive cars.,Men are being made to grow a beard.,and
45020_6,It happened in the past.,Its much different today.,because
46476_5,They got to ask each other questions.,They got to hear each other out.,and
44455_1,I thought it was very sexist.,Men forced women to cover up.,because
43237_4, who were wrongly killed ,I never uttered the pledge of allegiance.,Nan
43262_3,It's the biggest thing online.,It's in the news a few weeks.,and
43847_1,I am going to assert why the NFL players protesting are going about accomplishing their change agenda.,It is unfair to their audience.,Nan
42782_5,my family have literally been taken away from me over a matter of a few seconds.,I would not be able to handle it,and
42859_4,We need to spread our knowledge to our family and peers to eliminate the phobia of the Middle East,it is faultless people who are losing so much of their lives due to the war.,because
45453_1,I personally think its crazy that people base their opinions off of swayed news channels.,"They base their opinions on what they see on social media, especially our generation.",and

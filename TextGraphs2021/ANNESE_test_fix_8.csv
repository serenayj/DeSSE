45887_4,The white people got upset that the black people did not care to listen.,The black people did not care to hear the white people's side of the story.,when
44188_3,It’s what the majority of the country practices. ,It makes the coverage of Christianity different than Muslims. ,and
43597_2,He shows how similar Iraq is to the United States.,He tells us what the United States government did to Basim.,and
43206_5,Tamir Rice was killed because he matched the description.,A 12 year old boy.,and
45956_3,it gave the race that was silenced for so long a chance to hold the upper hand in a conversation,we have white people hear them say things that sound insane to us,because
44187_4,Europe colonized a lot of the world.,Europe converted many people into Christianity in places like West Africa and South America.,so
45893_2,My brother sat in on a class.,He has never experienced such an extraordinary opportunity.,because
44680_1,I am very proud to be an American.,"It was extremely eye opening to hear opinions from people from India, Korea, and Indonesia.",Nan
45619_1,Why not let it go. ,It will make him feel relief. ,so
44624_4,There was a bias that only black people can play ball.,There was a bias that blacks were good at ball.,because
45862_1,They went about the situation.,Black people had more in depth knowledge why the white people had historically thought of these crimes as okay.,when
46011_4,It affects the group that is doing the oppressing.,They may think that it is a problem.,and
45414_5,Most people here are Christians.,It is easier to hate.,because
45363_2,Many people believe that politics should be kept out of sports.,I see where they are coming from.,because
45610_2,Basim explained.,Many things have led up to how Iraq is today.,when
44849_1,the questions that were asked to the girls wearing the hijabs were interesting,"they were good questions, people might think about.",as
43996_1,We first hand got to see how people have opinions on many matters without even full understanding the matter,We first hand got to see how people have opinions on  many matters without even  finding out all the facts.,so
43779_2,There are some news sources that try to stray away from this tactic.,The job of the media is to create stories for their demographics.,Nan
45215_4,Her dad was facing intense racism.,Her dad interviewed for a few jobs.,and
43864_4,Often times citizens find themselves not pleased with the president they voted for.,The presidents talked themselves up during campaigns.,as
43460_2,To me it seems like the reason he isnt angry all the time is because he has his faith.,He turns to his religion for guidance.,and
45058_3,It is great that many people are gathering supplies for Puerto Rico in this time of need.,Evidence has surfaced that shows these supplies are not being distributed.,and
45744_4,They were rich from benefits of the slave trade.,and plantations.,Nan
43344_1,That could have easily been any of us.,"Fate would have it, we were born in the U.S.",as
42817_3,He made great American friends.,Americans were the ones who bombed his home on accident.,and
45932_5,You are being paid.,Only the laws have changed.,when
43531_3,I personally think it is because people are afraid of the truth,they don't know how to find a solution.,and
43448_1,People should step away from the generalizations to learn something real.,They should learn about the faith.,so
43238_1,I personally don't wear the hijab.,I didn't grow up in an environment where I was made to feel like I had to wear it.,and
42845_4,In to another person's shoes.,Who may be feeling discriminated against or have been living their life in fear everyday,and
44466_2,I always figured a bombing would take careful execution.,This is not the case.,and
44185_1,I think the important thing to remember is that most of the people in Iraq are not what is pictured on the news.,They are everyday citizens like myself and Basim.,Nan
42957_1,I feel like I say this every week.,I think this was a lecture that made a very big impact on a lot of people in the class.,Nan
45258_2,I became more motivated to learn more about this issue.,I became more motivated to advocate it.,for
46198_3,The hijab itself is not sexist at all in my opinion.,No one should be forced to wear a hijab.,when
45356_1,Sports stadium security increased.,Transit police forces increased.,and
43409_1,We make ourselves the heroes. ,Aren't we bad like the terrorists?,as
45901_3,We all need to be more aware of what is happening in other countries.,We all need to be more aware of what is happening in the world around us.,and
43356_1,It is much easier to empathize with people from other countries.,I am in SOC 119 now.,for
46114_1,This puts into perspective to white people that all the black people want to know is why.,"Why put them through slavery, why continue with the racism today.",and
44819_1,The American government didnt even fully financially reimburse him about the grief.,The American government didn't even fully financially reimburse him about the damage they casued.,for
46161_3,it gives you a different perspective because your not worried about yourself and able to look out in the world without so much worry. and See the world with less concern and less fear.,"When she said those words, for a couple of seconds Sam turned to me.",and
45243_4,A good question to ask is why they kept quiet.,Trump attacked John McCain for being a POW.,when
43364_4,We are all very similar.,Most people fail to pick up on our similarities.,so
43292_5,We should try not shop there., its less expensive.,and
46251_3,It is unpredictable how many people have lost their life.,It is unpredictable how many homes have been lost.,and
45018_2,It added a little humor.,It also showed how black people truly feel about the topic.,and
45948_1,Sam switched roles.,It allowed people to open up more.,for
45649_3,I realized how unfair society actually is in real life.,It's unfair for black people.,and
45250_2,I was very ignorant about this issue.,It taught me a lot more.,and
43067_1,We should all strive to have worldly views.,We should all strive to understand those around us.,if
43917_1,There have been three different presidents since the war started.,"I would think Basim would have more of an opinion, or thought on how the presidents change things.",and
44629_3,It is hard to feel so confused about it.,Religion is supposed to be something sacred.,because
43469_1,I too knew that war had a toll on civilian life.,This was one the first experience I had seen of it like this.,Nan
44752_4,He makes us talk about them.,We truly understand.,so
46145_1,It's that pure racism is very deeply embedded in our history.,It still remains a part of our society today.,so
46037_2,I currently hold a negative view on the middle east.,My family has endured.,because
43481_4,That shows different cultures.,That shows different religions that I know nothing about. ,and
45421_2,Say we reverse history.,it is the white people who feel oppressed,and
44793_6,The conversations were built.,"and the history kept spilling out, it was easy to create this flip flop situation in my head.",as
42876_2,The actions of people should be judged by that person.,The actions of people shouldn't be judged by the belief they share with others.,and
44417_5,From the terrorist attack in Spain.,In which a Muslim driving towards pedestrians in Barcelona.,Nan
43825_4,i like it,very useful,and
43964_1,Being celebrated at the White House is a national honor.,No matter who is in office.,Nan
44892_4,They hope their dead end up in heaven..,They consider the ways they follow the bible.,when
45834_1,He gave statistics first.,I'm being completely honest.,and
45063_1,Mothers would kill their own new born babies.,They believed death was better than living a life enslaved to the Europeans.,as
44241_2,He said he felt that anger would just eat him from the inside.,Anger is something that has the ability to take over people's minds and actions.,Nan
45749_1,Efforts need to be made.,Distribute success and privilege to all races.,Nan
44710_2,I was surprised.,Sam told us that Bassim was on the screen skyping with this class.,when
45409_1,She had bruises up and down her arms.,She had marks on her neck.,and
44152_5,Americans feel pride toward our country .,We also don't always focus on things that are not happening on our soil.,and
43777_1,Sam has said this.,Muslims look at the United States. ,Nan
43393_1,People burning season tickets and jerseys was over the top.,They could've just sold it.,for
43118_2,Sam mentioned an important message.,social media and news are posting terrible events that had done by the ISIS.,when
43301_2,"By the year 2013, their wealth didn't double.",Their wealth was nowhere near the amount that white people made.,and
43854_2,They have plenty of fame outside of the football field.,Why not band together?,so
43835_1,You may consider one view the right view.,It does not mean you should close yourself off to other ideas.,as
45752_1,The lecture was very interesting to me because I got to see how war affects real people,This clip was very interesting to me because I got to see how war affects real people,and
46265_2,Global citizens it is our duty to find unbiased media sources.,Global citizens it is our duty to find truthful media sources.,as
44575_1,The question was how Basim views the different Presidents of the United States.,How Basim views from the time of the intervention in Iraq to present day.,Nan
46049_1,A lot of the cases show that the unarmed black men and women were clearly innocent.,The officers walked away free.,Nan
42817_2,He went to school in America.,He made great American friends.,so
43590_1,This is one of those events you think could never happen.,"However, it does.",Nan
42817_1,He went to school in America.,He made great American friends.,and
45607_1,I believe that more people should took the time to actually study.,I believe that more people should really get to know all the rules.,and
45492_4,Lawyers attend an extra three years of school.,"and must pass two entry exams (one being the LSAT and one being the bar), before being allowed to practice law.",and
43675_1,Bassim's response really opened up my mind.,His response broadened my view on the subject.,and
45707_1,It opened my eyes.,White people imposed horrors on slaves.,and
43794_1,Sitting is considered disrespectful. ,Why is printing on plates not considered disrespectful?,and
46452_4,They only cover their skin for unfamilar men.,They only wear their hijabs for going outside.,and
43159_2,Crazies who make their own interpretation.,Crazies who use it to excuse violence.,and
45385_3,It really brought to light just how awful the African American population was treated.,How they are treated in society today.,and
44538_1,This kneeling could be a call that a whole race is hurt.,The players are honoring that. ,and
43049_1,We see all the time,We see all the time,Nan
45281_1,It's things like that.,Racism is most evident.,and
44626_2,I had heard that this class was life changing.,It would really open eyes on a lot of issues.,and
46462_1,One could make the argument that female hair is different.,Female hair can be sexualized.,and
44428_3,we need to see that it still was our ancestors., we have an extent of responsibility for what happened.,and
43349_1,The way he talked about his wife just made it so much more real to me.,The way he talked about his kids in the message just made it so much more real to me.,and
44977_6,I just stay set in my own ways.,I will never progress as  a human.,Nan
43774_7,Education isn't improving.,Health care isn't improving.,and
43281_1,He is so admirable for turning to his religion for strength.,He is so admirable not letting his anger take over him.,and
44468_1,It's inspiring.,He was alright speaking to us.,Nan
43081_1,They need aid from people that will help them evolve.,They need aid from people that will help them build their lives how they want to in order for them to be in peace. ,and
43337_2,it ultimately came down to each candidates character.,"it was an easy choice considering one of the two candidates was and is still racist, sexist, and homophobic.",Nan
46032_2,We watch Mr. Evans.,He goes on a journey through the middle east.,as
44137_1,I heard what happened to Basim,It was truly so sad.,Nan
45811_6,We cannot advance if we fight over religion.,We cannot advance if we fight over wealth.,and
44234_4,They talk about Muslims in such a harsh light.,We have to in a sense hate groups here in America claiming to be Christians.,when
43636_2,Miss out on advantageous relationships with foreign nations.,We choose not to learn about them.,and
45365_6,It's so they are able to play football.,These athletes are squashing all of the military's hard work.,for
44551_1,I was also devastated with Basim's story.,it made me realize how many other families had to go through the same thing.,and
45248_1,Like I know there are a lot of Buddhism groups.,That are saying that they are raising money to help other people.,Nan
45816_2,I have already begun to think about people differently.,I've come to understand or want to explore things about people.,and
45300_4,I learned an invaluable lesson.,youre not liable to learn anywhere else.,Nan
46305_2,The black doing the same thing as if they were white was very eye opening to me.,it was much more exciting than a regular lecture about black history.,and
42816_1,It was honestly kind of embarrassing.,I was ignorant to life over there.,Nan
46274_1,I listen to a lot of Christian rap music.,"One of lines that always stands out to me is from Andy Mineo's song ""Now I Know.""",and
43050_3,He is matured.,He has intelligence that many in the world could benefit from.,and
46424_1,I'm not exactly sure why she disliked it so much.,I personally never judged anyone who wore a hijab.,because
43598_3,I could not even imagine the pain he had to go through., I could not even imagine the pain he is still going through.,and
45308_1,It was all the same facts involved.,It was just made about white people?,Nan
43534_4,I am pretty sure it is the lack of education.,It is the lack of awareness.,and
44328_1,We are much more.,We are more than the labels we put on.,so
45521_3,It's how the media portrays it.,It's police officers killing people based off their color.,as
46405_10,t flipped like in the lecture to reduce confusion.,"throughout the lecture they kept portraying all whites like bigoted, selfish, greedy, had no regard to any other human that was not white.",as
46313_2,These traits allow others to understand.,These traits help others understand who a person is.,for
44000_2,Sam brought two people who would be somewhat related to the situation.,Sam challenged their opinions on the matter.,and
45111_1,It's like the guy in the video said.,The police are supposed to be the good guys.,as
44707_4,I think that we should be more cooperative when black people feel like they are not being heard. ,I think we should be more active and cooperative when black people feel that they are not being treated equally. ,and
45647_2,I found it very interesting to hear their opinion.,White people are behind in society.,because
45732_4,It would be best to eventually let it go.,It would be best to learn to forgive.,and
44647_2,I was not in sociology on the day this lecture happened.,I would have never known the alarming statistics.,if
44619_1,Basketball traditionally is played in cities.,It is so easy to set up a basketball park.,because
42848_1,It is a sad thing to see.,I believe that empathy and a change of perspective will give people the ability to see the people different than how they are portrayed to be.,Nan
43034_3,He choked down tears.,He talked about how this country makes him feel.,as
45884_5,Sam said.,They ran our country.,as
45033_2,It can be something as simple as having an educated conversation with someone.,They should follow a religion other than Christianity.,Nan
45250_1,This class taught me that I was very ignorant.,I was very ignorant about this issue.,Nan
45397_2,One thing i will say is that.,Some police may be racist against blacks.,and
44611_3,Bassims people might have more of an appeal to Obama.,He looked more similar to them.,if
44683_3,I am loving people for the good.,I am loving people for the bad.,and
45883_2,They included the concept that the whites had nothing left.,They were basically forced to go back to the blacks for more work.,so
46038_3,It will help us better understand each other.,Maybe the military should be required to learn about the culture of the countries they enter.,if
44223_2,Sam was able to put us in the shoes of Basim.,"Basim had lost his wife, daughter, brother, nephew, dog, and house due to an American bomb.",and
46479_2,She said she put one on for the first time.,She felt like she did not have to care about what she looked like.,when
44997_1,This is hypocritical.,It is almost an identical situation.,Nan
43663_4,We make ourselves feel better by saying they really aren't Christians.,Christians  would never kill.,because
45310_1,I thought it was really crazy to find out.,"Following the abolishment of slavery, former slaves had it worse.",for
43811_3,Everyone has their own opinions., the bible can be interpreted in a million different ways.,so
44130_1,There are people all around the world who are just like us.,We can never see this.,Nan
43264_3,They saw that they had to fight for it in the 60s.,They now have to keep fighting.,because
43850_2,Choosing to do the protest at this place is unfair to the audience.,The audience is a captive.,and
46183_3,It is how they are raised.,They are used to it.,so
44385_2,Basims home was bombed by accident which killed his wife.,"an accident killed his daughter, brother, and nephew.",Nan
43176_1,Religion can be powerful.,Imagine a group of people decided to interpret the meanings.,and
43760_1,Sam is absolutely right.,This class can go 24/7.,when
43787_2,We can try to put ourselves in their shoes.,We can try to understand that other people's reality could have been yours.,and
44418_1,Hate is everywhere.,It cannot be blamed by religion.,and
43947_1,Bassim told us his story about how a few years ago bomb destroyed his home.,It killed most of his family due to the US military's miscalculation.,because
43868_2,Bassim said.,The last 3 US presidents seem to differ a lot in personal character.,Nan
45768_3,The roles of whites switched.,I realized how wicked our world is.,and
46289_1,It is a choice that a woman might make.,She might have religious reasons.,for
43778_2,mold our perspectives.,the media sensationalizes.,for
45040_1,They might live in an area where it is predominantly Caucasian.,"The way they live, is how they think everyone else lives.",and
44373_1,There really is no difference between the past three presidents.,They have done nothing to improve upon the situations,as
44728_6,Anger doesn't solve anything., that was a sentiment I fully agree with.,because
43661_4,"the Middle East is not being exposed to their actual culture, belief, or way of life we are naive",the Middle East is believe what we are told.,and
43790_1,You truly do not hear as much at all about Christians doing anything horrible.,As you said they are mostly white people.,and
45994_2,He needs to be held at a higher value.,"He is the President, not a late night talk show host.",and
44865_1,I was sitting in the audience during this lesson.,It was hard to not find it comical.,Nan
43047_1,War is unwavering.,War does not discriminate.,Nan
46346_3,They gathered together taking pictures.,"They are eating, laughing and even taking artifacts.",and
46269_4, people are treated differently due to the color of the skin.,"It was peoples ancestors who did it, we are responsible to fix the issues , they are still happening in the present.",because
44376_1,"The people of the United States wonder, is there anything that we can do to help?",There are innocent people being hurt.,as
45265_5,They have different beliefs. ,It doesn’t make them less worthy than you. ,as
43426_2,It is like the United States of America.,People tend to ignore the Christian on Christian judgments.,as
46105_2,A white person growing up in a predominantly white society.,I never really had to face racial discrimination before.,so
45132_5,Those feel.,They can do whatever they want in the name of their own god.,as
46299_2,The Hijab represents a strong belief in religion.,I really wonder.,if
42816_2,I was ignorant to life over there.,Listening to Basim allowed me to understand Afghanistan better.,Nan
45456_3,"I can't remember the actual stats, or who conducted it.",I do remember it was EXTREMELY fast.,and
45365_2,I could see how it could be disrespectful for the military/people in the service.,They put their lives on the line every single day.,because
44580_2,It was shocking to me.,I'm an American.,because
43180_1,It is important to think of ourselves as not only American but as worldly citizens.,We should educate ourselves about what our government is doing abroad.,and
45675_1,This is true.,People had lost the civil war.,for
43252_3,I certainly liked Obama more than Bush.,I think that I just kind of assumed that he would have had a more positive reaction coming from an Iraqi.,so
43568_1,It was very personable.,It helped give people more of a sense of what is going on around us.,and
46392_3,Explaining our history was eye-opening to me.,It happened to white people.,and
43363_5,They think to themselves.,People who associate with the Taliban aren't Muslim.,and
44795_2,To see sam tell the story of how life was with slavery.,Sam described the treatment of the whites was mind boggling.,and
45887_3,The white people got upset that the black people did not care to listen.,The black people did not care to hear the white people's side of the story.,as
46263_1,Media is shaping our future.,Media makes things better.,for
45476_1,I thought men made them wear hijabs.,I thought wearing hijabs was a sexist act.,as
44933_3,We may need the resources .,Why not try to negotiate?,so
45820_1,Why do we get caught up in our differences?,We can't even have a normal conversation girl to girl.,so
42878_3,Everyone in the world knows what actually is going on.,People are being affected.,and
46512_1,People see hijab as a flag for religion.,It is often a religion they know nothing about.,and
43214_1,they are purposely vague.,"to be questioned, because.",and
44746_1,Things are much simpler than they were years ago.,We don't use it to our advantage.,so
45281_3,It actually largely .reminds me of some other things,They happen in the world.,Nan
45908_3,A couple of girls in class came up wearing hijabs.,The girls wearing hijabs talked about their hijabs.,and
46271_1,I have realized  many things in the first half of this semester from this class.,The major thing that I have learned is that it is  important to have empathy towards people.,and
45692_4,These tensions can grow. ,Making the ultimate goal more foggy. ,as
44521_1,I mentioned in my original video response.,I think the media sugar coats.,as
45830_1,They heard Bassims story.,Their minds might be changed.,Nan
44977_2,I always want to be learning new things.,I always want to be hearing different opinions.,because
46099_1,This was a very interesting topic.,We talked about it.,for
43983_1,This is the statement I agree with most in the above response.,I believe it is our duty to be informed.,and
43505_1,The same assumptions can be made about our similarities.,Train yourself to notice similarities before differences.,if
45884_3,"The white people in history were always the ones on top,",Sam said.,as
45953_1,I also found it very interesting to hear.,White students talk about oppression.,Nan
46133_1,I personally would be annoyed with my government.,I do not believe that they have the right to tell me what I can do with my body.,because
43993_1,You could never put a price tag on the people you love most.,I almost think trying to made the situation even more insensitive.,and
44220_1,They are no different than us.,It would be helpful for us to think like that.,if
45514_2,He was able to forgive.,He was able to not hate all Americans.,and
43333_1,I myself am guilty of instantly disliking someone.,they've identified as a trump supporter.,because
44097_4,Trump has done minimal things to help them.,They are U.S. citizens.,and
44396_2,Videos of black people being discriminated is very publicized in today's media.,Videos of black people being killed by police is very publicized in today's media.,and
42843_5,They want to provide for their family.,exactly the same as the people living in the United States.,and
45182_6,"Trying to play opposite roles, the students took turns trying to talk about their history.","At first, I think they found it hard to get into character.",when
45288_4,Every human on earth lives a vivid life.,Every human on earth lives a real life.,as
43896_2,"In the past, I've relied so much on the media.",I've relied so much on the opinions of my elders to drive my thought process.,and
43960_4,They didn't change from last week., Ill give it a shot anyway.,Nan
45067_7,They say they'll make the situation better over in the middle east.,Basim said that there has been no notable difference between the policies and actions of those in office.,and
43454_1,"So with all of these similarities in mind, why is it that we choose to only see the differences?",Why is it that we choose to only see the hate between these two groups of people?,Nan
43950_2,Those teachers that teach their knowledge.,Those teachers that preach about life.,and
44954_2,"This person essentially said, indifferently, it is your country.",You should care about it.,and
44667_1,I read a tweet. ,Don’t all white arguments sound ridiculous,Nan
44054_1,Data were shown in class.,The data further strengthened the argument.,for
44960_2,What white people did to keep black people oppressed after the civil war and slavery.,It gave a whole different impact when the roles were switched.,Nan
43772_2,i like good.,Another thing I found interesting.,Nan
43525_1,It was upsetting to hear that other very developed countries like England are more globally aware than the US.,This is a country founded upon religious tolerance and religious freedom.,because
45054_1,I'm glad.,This class has enabled me to see issues like race in a different light than I was ever able to before.,Nan

42967_3,"To be honest, listening to Basim talk, I tried putting myself in his shoes.",I tried asking myself what I would should something like this happen to me.,when

43792_3,"this fosters the generalizations that we pass upon a whole group of people belonging to that one religion, even though as we said in class, both Christianity and Muslim are fundamentally the same religions.", they both want everyone to be good people to the heart.,because
45822_1,My favorite part was the students trying on Hijabs.,The students shared their thoughts with the class.,when
45463_5,that is where I felt that white people were at their most ignorant due to the ingrained inequality thought process that,has plagued America since its founding.,and
45201_3,Blacks enslaved the poor Europeans.,They needed people to work the land.,because

46019_1,Coming to college has taught me a lot about different religions. ,I have learned that there is beauty in every single culture religion. ,and
45864_1,I think that this shows the true divide in society. ,This shows the little education that is presented today.,and
45017_2,Some black people act like white people.,They talk about their ancestors.,as
44416_1,"Like Sam said, many people use the bible to justify their actions.",Everyone can interpret the words in their own ways.,and

44285_1,Everyone harps on the fact that this issue is a race issue.,"Clearly, race isn't the problem here.",when
45192_1,People who care only about their own lives.,People who think what they see is reality.,and
43463_3,I am in no way saying we should not be cautious.,Maybe there needs to be more done about the screening process for these bombings.,Nan
42904_1,This really stuck with me.,I have often thought about some of the far right Christian groups in America.,because
45801_3,We can't generalize that all Muslims act like ISIS members.,It is simply not true.,because
44068_1,I am not a person who is religious.,My parents are.,Nan
44062_2,It's very important to take the time to understand their issues.,It's very important to see what you can do to help.,and

42923_1,I recently got in a argument with my best friends mom.,She does not know but hears from society.,because
45751_2,There were two guest speakers.,One from Afghanistan.,when
43487_2,I wondered.,This was a topic of interest to him.,if
45484_2,It is true that half of us are just starting to learn about all of the important issues.,It is true that half of us are just starting to learn about all of the relative issues.,so
45274_4,People of your own color are associated with representing demeaning circumstances.,"They are things like poverty, riots, drug deals, and segregation.",and
45205_4,Any race would have had the same advantages today.,white people just happened to be that race.,Nan
45679_1,It was hard to engage with.,Some people weren't sitting directly up front.,if

43577_1,Some people I know try to say those hate groups are formed due to jealousy of the United States.,I believe it is more due to the many innocent civilians we have accidentally killed in the Middle East.,so
44226_1,It was interesting to see the comparisons.,We don't acknowledge Christians killing Christians.,because
43077_2,They promise to change the way of life,hey end up not doing very much.,Nan
45018_5,It must be frustrating when white people don't understand their perspective.,they don'ttruly know what its like because they have notexperienced the kind of discrimination that they have.,because
44473_2,We need to make it a point.,Government individuals who represent our country have a moral compass.,and

44102_2,Like we’ve been going over international issues.,Like we’ve been going over international relations for quite a while in this class. ,and

43574_1,A single person in my family were to be harmed by a foreign government.,The hate would sit in my heart towards that government.,if
45087_5,Men do the same thing.,Men are praised.,and
44172_2,We are not aware of the world.,The people in it are fearful.,because

43082_2,Basim addressed the entire class not a lot to give us advice. ,He asked that we expand our awareness outside of the United States.,so

43358_2,We would be more inclined to report only the facts of situations.,We would learn not to generalize people based on some piece of information.,because

46335_1,I do not think there is one best way to learn something.,It varies a lot on what their best way of learning is.,and
43167_2,They have faith the justice system will prevail.,The system will work in their favor.,and
45542_1,Not only have we become so ignorant to forget its origins.,We seem to think slavery was something only white people did to black people.,Nan
44209_1,I couldn't help to feel responsible.,Sam and Basim explain to the class.,when
43774_11,Health care isn't improving.,Pensions are not improving. ,and
46183_4,They are used to it.,I wanted to learn more.,so
46357_1,This is important.,you are thinking about the lives of other people in places.,when
44794_3,It was flip flopped with feelings.,It was flip flopped with actions that happened throughout time.,and
46225_1,The participants of the exercise were quick to bring up they need to work harder. ,It linked to what I noticed before. ,Nan
45087_2,The men were allowed to improve their understanding of the issues that women face.,Women are called names.,when
46294_3,I am proud of that scar.,I am not embarrassed or ashamed of it.,and
44672_3,Most of us could not control what the government does.,Their forces do things to other countries.,and
44249_2,It is much harder to be the better person.,It is much harder to forgive others.,for
44728_1,I was especially touched.,Bassim mentioned.,when
46358_1,"Lastly, I believe that people need to learn to forgive.",We can all live together peacefully.,so
43691_3,It is only a small percentage.,It's like with every other group that tarnishes the reputation for the whole.,and
44096_4,Why should the U.S. spread itself so thin?,we can't even help ourselves.,Nan
46402_2,This is important.,I feel we should all at least have basic empathy for all individuals.,because
46205_2,Protesters want other people to realize.,"Although it may be through subtle ways, we are all still not considered equal in our society.",and
42975_3,Sam telling us that there is no set schedule of topics really made me think.,He can just decide one week what he wants to bring up in class.,if
43935_3,the disadvantages.,I think that by taking a knee.,and
45259_3, it promotes the lack of education of other societys., it promotes the lack of cultures today.,and
44033_1,News like this is not broadcasted all over in the US.,It's something embarrassing that we did.,because
45512_2,It doesn't affect them.,"To me, that is sickening.",and
44623_4,You can find plenty of white people just as tall as black people.,They are in the NBA if you look for them.,Nan
45623_1,I am not someone who has taken a lot of history classes in the past.,I was definitely super surprised.,so
43207_1,There is so much corruption in the police departments across the country. ,We don't screen for bias. ,because
44193_1,I think it would be very hard to make laws using one book.,It can be interpreted in many ways.,because
45197_1,Here's an example.,Columbus came to this new world.,for
46452_3,They only cover their skin for going outside.,They only cover their skin for unfamilar men.,and
44449_1,I think a lot of our lack of information comes from the media.,they feed us with information that we want to hear.,Nan
43742_1,very useful,very useful,when
45275_4,I had never considered how weird it would be to be always looking at pictures of groups of white people.,I had never considered how weird it would be to  only seeing my own culture in negative depictions.,and
44245_3,Forgiveness is promoted in every mass.,I don't know.,if
46268_2,I kept thinking everything the white black people were saying was very conceited.,I kept thinking everything the white black people were saying was very rude.,and
45804_7,They know.,They want to sway believers using false evidence.,and
45526_1,i think he had poisoned the idea of free speech. ,I stand for our flag. ,Nan
45835_1,I think that has to do with the media.,You'll almost always hear a story of a black person being killed.,and
45751_1,This clip comes from the lecture.,There were two guest speakers.,when
43282_1,He explained that he felt he was kept alive for a reason.,I completely agree.,and
43090_1,"With this technology, we have an obligation.",An obligation to be aware of what goes on outside our borders.,Nan
43474_2,I have come to realize something.,"Those who endure the worst circumstances in life, must grow to become the strongest.",and
43023_5,We shouldn't assume that the people killing people in the Middle East aren't Muslims.,We shouldn't assume that the people claiming to be Muslims aren't Muslims.,so
45046_5,It does not matter how hard some people work.,There is the sense of racism.,because
44735_5,They captured slaves who propelled the Africans' development.,They were eventually taking the native land in the Americas.,and
43002_1,These books are tools on how to live your own life.,Why is it such a huge deal men fall in love?,if
45067_5,Consider what we're often told by those in/running for office.,They say they'll make the situation better over in the middle east.,and
44303_4,I would barely be able to control my anger.,That were to happen to me.,if
44111_1,We can be informed on what is going on in our own country.,There is no way we can be informed on what is going on in the rest of the world.,Nan
42843_2,It does not mean they should be in need.,They are just people that want to be healthy.,because
42784_1,"From his experiences, he embraced the fact.",He was kept alive for a reason.,and
45414_6,It is easier to hate.,It is easier to judge someone who is not from the same group as you.,and
46477_2,Sam put them on the spot.,Sam asked them what they think about each other opinion wise.,and
44902_3,The US army invaded Iraq.,The US wants to get control of Middle East.,when
43635_1,I have heard from Bassim. ,I wish I had learned this earlier. ,when
43289_1,It's almost like the United States is censoring its citizens even from childhood.,they don't know any better than to obsess over red white and blue.,so
43516_1,i like it,i like it,as
44507_2,NFL players were protesting about legitimate issues,he completely twisted it to make it all about him,and
43513_1,A lot of people today fear Muslims.,They see negative things in social media.,because
45646_2,Black people gave their take of the system.,The roles were reversed.,if
45333_2,immigration policy on undocumented immigrants is eye-opening.,immigration policy is eye-opening to those who it doesn't impact daily.,Nan
43327_5,his life so.,he lets Islam guide,and
46217_1,The idea of reversing the roles of Blacks and Whites through history sounded a little extreme to me at first.,Sam molded this story of oppressive Blacks and enslaved Whites.,as
46264_1,We should be more knowledgeable of what gets said via the media.,We should be more knowledgeable of what actually happens.,and
43312_1,I find that sometimes we are so wrapped up in its own little world.,We are not even aware of what is going on around us.,Nan
42825_1,I believe that the good acts that Christians do are in the news.,I believe that the bad acts that Christians do are too.,as

45435_4,All 5 of the hijab wearing women laughed.,All 5 of the hijab wearing women agreed.,and
43097_4,It really makes me wonder though.,It really makes me wonder though.,as
43995_5,We should see them like the families they are.,That is how we will move away from stereotyping.,and
45026_3,He simply allows himself to be human.,He allows his students to be human.,because
46257_5,it gave me a real look into what it was like to be a black person today.,I got to see it in a whole new perspective.,and
46491_2,I celebrate traditions that are hundreds of years old with my family. ,I can claim a family name and legacy. ,and
45061_2,The Tainos were a peaceful people.,Columbus came.,when
44058_1,By spreading the word on national television people all around the world will begin to talk about this.,With the right motivation change will soon come.,and
46237_1,The class is really a great one.,There is a diversity in that room.,because
44641_1,The chosen path has more positive effects,it is better than the other option,Nan
45862_4,They could explain why the white people had historically thought of these crimes as okay.,They could justify why the white people had historically thought of these crimes as okay.,and
46180_2,A woman chooses to wear it.,Isn't that her choice?,if
45811_2,The human species cannot advance if we continue to segregate.,We cannot advance if we fight over race.,as
43752_4,Some issues were not present at first.,The students were engaged. ,when
43880_1,People who call themselves muslim kill.,People who call themselves Christian kill,for
46007_1,It was interesting to see.,The group that is usually in a position of superiority became the inferior group.,when
45332_1,He really did fail to live up to the aspirations.,Latinxs had for him.,Nan
43981_1,I understand it is important for people to have their beliefs.,I understand it is important for people to have their values.,and
44847_2,This was one of my favorite classes.,I thought it was awesome to see the role switched.,so
44562_1,All he wanted was his life.,All he wanted was his family.,and
45842_3,Seeing the world through someone elses eyes.,I think this stuck out to me the most.,and
43578_2,I personally do not know if I could continue to live.,I do not know if I could live if my family died how Basim's family died.,because
45988_1,Basim could be so angry.,Angry at every american he has known.,for
46392_4,Explaining our history was eye-opening to me.,It happened to white people.,as
46305_1,This activity of switching sides and making the whites speak and give opinions or responses as if they were black.,The black doing the same thing as if they were white was very eye opening to me.,and
44407_3,They think it's a killing tool.,They think it tells the Muslim to kill Christians with the right perspective.,as
45508_1,THey do care about it. ,Most of them are in favor of the police.,if
45241_5,what he did is not disrespectful toward the flag.,"Others do(use it  clothing, napkins, laying it flat horizontally, etc",as
43950_5,Those teachers that preach about life.,"Those teachers more importantly care about you as a human being, not just another number.",as
43123_4,This includes printing the flag on disposable items.,This includes using the flag to help advertise a product.,and
43116_4,they want them to fight for themselves.,and involved with conflict as soon as possible.,because
42939_1,Basim went by his knowledge and experiences in the war.,He could see we don't all share the same wants and beliefs,Nan
45688_1,The main question that surrounded this video was power.,It was the ideology of having to stay dominant.,and
45390_8,employers had power to control of where their workers went.,and how long they were out for.,and
43985_4,I have learned a lot.,There is much more to learn.,so
42965_2,i like my life.,i like my life.,because
46443_1,Going through these journeys opens up your mind to new ideas.,Mark said it's not the physical aspect that is hard.,and
45551_1,This began in the Tang Dynasty.,some slavery still lasts today.,and
44381_3, there are not people who do follow their religion to perfection.,They do things like forgive the unforgivable.,as
45306_1,I think there is only so much we can do to be understanding before we actually take action to make things right. ,I think there is only so much we can do to be understanding before we actually take action to make things truly equal for everyone. ,and
43260_3,We weren't prepared to deal with what would come next. ,A lack of forethought that really put us in this predicament.,Nan
44268_2,It spoke upon the hidden hypocrisy of everyone in America.,Even if you are welcoming or not.,because
45177_2,To put myself in a black person's shoes.,To see what they had to go through. ,and
44763_4,She realizes that she'll be critically judged by others.,She shows much of her skin.,because
45732_5,It would be best to learn to forgive.,Basim did.,and
46257_1,That is why I really appreciated this class.,it gave me a real look into what it was like to be a black person during those times.,because
45833_1,The class you are referring to I enjoyed.,The class went through and gave us information first. ,because
43621_1,He mentioned how there are people that work on cocoa farms.,They only get paid four dollars a day.,and
43019_1,I heard about violent stories on the news,I worried about my parents being deployed there,and
43053_2,She was raised there. ,She got married to my grandfather who is a Saudi. ,and

43359_1,I hope that I will continue to learn.,I hope that I will continue to grow.,and
45075_1,Extremist groups do terrible things.,They are certain religions.,because
44558_5,We are being ignorant.,We are naive to was is really happening around the world.,and
45654_2,It was really interesting to see the statistics.,Many people were killed by police.,and
44625_1,People see their idols they grow up with in certain sports.,They are all the same.,Nan
45121_2,It was  engaging.,everyone seemed to be speaking from their heart.,because
42944_4, it gives me a great deal of insight on how blessed I am to never have experienced something  terrible,it  changes my perspective on what our military is doing to these innocent people.,because
44915_1,My definition of black lives matter is simple. ,There is a particular group of people that are being killed by police.,as
45188_3,There isn't much to say.,They can state the oppression problem.,for
46295_7,I don't have to think about whether people are looking at my scar.,I can just be present in the moment.,because
45188_4,They can state the oppression problem.,They can state how they want to get it done.,and
44172_1,We are not aware of the world.,The people in it are fearful.,and
45182_8,"At first, I think they found it hard to get into character.",They found it hard to find something to say.,and
44547_1,It was very interesting to see that their cultures are alive, no one gives them the respect they deserve.,and
43683_3,This man is able to forgive Americans for what happened to his family.,Everyone should be able to forgive.,because
43602_3,I believe it is more due to the many innocent civilians.,That we have accidentally killed in the Middle East. ,so
46007_3,They were saying the same things.,They were voicing the same complaints.,and
43995_1,We all need to stop seeing them like they are residents of a battlefield.,We should see them like the families they are.,and
46405_4, I will refer to white people to  white people, I will refer to white people black people like black people,for
45722_1,Im not goanna lie.,A couple times during this exercise I thought to myself wow white people really suck for what they did to people of color.,Nan
45046_1,That was said in this class that day., that might sound like the ideal thing.,and
45794_4,We begin to feel guilty about who we are.,We use this horrid word again.,if
44710_3,Sam told us that Bassim was on the screen skyping with this class.,We could hear his actual reaction.,and
43386_2,Progress has been made.,Black people are still projected to earn much lower amounts of money than white people.,and
45699_5,I only perceived based off what I knew.,I believed things based off what my family knew.,and
43038_1,Its not fair to say that Muslims are killing Muslims.,We wouldnt say the same thing about the violence groups here in the U.S. are committing.,if
44988_2,when the roles were switch both people were spot on.,This is what the majority of each group would say if the situation was switched.,Nan
43135_2,It is easy for us to turn a blind eye to these things.,These things are not happening in our backyard.,because
44465_1,Our government is supposed to be in place to protect us.,"Somehow, we manage to bomb the wrong place.",and
43072_1,Presidents do not change.,They have limits that are set by their own colleagues.,Nan
46352_1,"Forgiveness takes a lot of self discipline, to be able to fully excuse our government.","Causing such destruction killing his dog, brother, wife...these people can not be replaced. ",so
43313_6,The problem affects us directly.,We can benefit from it.,if
45500_2,People say they want change in the media.,We fail to recognize real individuals devising these stories behind the scenes.,and
46152_2,I gain wisdom like Bassim.,I reflect on what my religion tells me to do.,and
44132_1,Americans literally came in.,They started killing people.,and
45929_4,One civilization was a little bit more advanced in technology.,It was advanced in communication before the other.,and
45742_3,Sam controls the conversation.,Sam moves on.,and
46163_4,They're actually elevated.,truly empowered me.,Nan
43533_2,A lot of things outside of our country.,Which sometimes forces a certain biased in us. ,Nan
44977_3,I always want to be learning new things.,I always want to be hearing different opinions.,if
43698_1,"If we decide not to do this, it is our own fault.",It is not the fault of our parents.,and
44103_1,Sams excitement about certain issues definitely stems out to the class.,I think its crazy he he tries hard to reach the issues from many different angles.,and
43342_2,"We want him to say, yes, Iraq can one day go back to normal.",We want him to say Iraq can be as beautiful as it used to be.,and
46183_1,I understand it is their culture.,It is how they are raised.,and
44706_1,You keep saying it's history.,History repeats itself.,Nan
45932_6,Only the laws have changed.,not the way people acted.,Nan
43604_2,Due to these instances.,I do hope they are more careful.,because
45647_4,They were words.,White people have said about the situation in real life.,Nan
43672_3,I would go to extreme lengths to ensure the ones who caused the tragedy in my life to be severely punished.,"Preferably, dead immediately.",and
46188_1,Your definition was a great way to describe what this movement is.,The black lives matter movement helped a white man's family.,and
44780_1,He also said because he is Muslin. ,Muslims believe in forgiveness. ,Nan
45316_1,People are grouped in  like oppressive.,other people of that same race did.,because
42988_2,"From the outside, they imagine criminals taking jobs.","From the outside, they imagine criminals taking resources that belong to us.",and
45501_1,It is our own people allowing this to happen.,It is our own people allowing this to happen.,Nan
45441_1,This conversation really opened my eyes to see beyond stereotypes.,What its like wearing hijabs.,and
43376_4,I think it's something a lot of adults tend to forget.,"They don't see others as real people sometimes, primarily in the context of war.",and
46405_5, I will refer to white people black people like black people,t flipped like in the lecture to reduce confusion.,and
45938_1,"This reminds me of the laws that passed free slaves, their owners could approve them leaving.","They could travel take new jobs, find new homes with permission. ",when
43597_5,He tells us what the United States government did to Basim.,He tells us what it did to his family,and
46400_1,"Being young black woman, I will never be able to completely understand the things that a older Muslim man endures.", I will never be able to completely understand the things that a older Muslim man endures in his everyday life.,Nan
43327_3,he lets Islam guide his life so.,his life so.,as
45896_1,I guess you never really realize that some of the ways we think is ignorant.,the ways we think are unbelievably ignorant.,and
45525_1,The words he used to describe the Charlottesville march were violent and bad.,He claimed that the white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville had freedom of speech.,Nan
43476_3,An individual who has chosen to understand.,Anger is not the answer.,and
43611_1,We need to fill these gaps by finding ways to talk to people with different perspectives.,We need to do research of our own.,and
45196_1,Way back in the 1400's mankind was a more savage race.,Way back in the 1400's mankind was less sophisticated.,Nan
45111_4,It's really hard to hear that they are brutally beating innocent people.,Their skin color doesn't matter.,Nan
44211_1,"All the people like Basim and his family, everyone their lives have been turned completely upside down.",It is that America invaded 16 years ago.,because
45521_1,I feel like in the past few years it has been unfortunately a brought up topic.,It's how the media portrays it.,as
43893_2,It is important that we criticize our President when needed in order to make sure that we stay informed.,It is important that we criticize our President when needed so that they are pulling through on the promises they make.,and
44728_2,Bassim mentioned.,He is not angry at the Americans.,because
43225_1,there is a lot of coverage of hurricane season in the Caribbean,it usually affects our shores,because
46118_1,It was one small example of the rethinking I did in class.,The others relearned things as well in this class.,and
43097_5,It really makes me wonder though.,It really makes me wonder though.,if
43545_3,It is so important for people to be more aware.,What is going on in the rest of the world?,because
45842_2,It is about getting out of your own shoes.,Seeing the world through someone elses eyes.,and
46027_1,the reason those white students have enough points to argue in this exercise is.,they have heard so much about why racism is wrong.,because
43388_1,Media outlets have been talking non stop about athletes taking the knee during the national anthem.,News outlets have been talking non stop about athletes taking the knee during the national anthem.,and
43546_1,Sometimes we get caught up in our own day to day lives.,We forget to see what is going on around us.,as
44097_3,We barely see it in the news anymore.,Trump has done minimal things to help them.,and
43771_1,I found this statement interesting.,"here in the United States when someone else becomes President, their polices are different from the previous President.",because
45770_1,Americans fought in the Revolutionary War.,It was justified.,and
45107_1,Anyone can imagine what could have happened.,His life would have changed.,and
45645_1,I grew up in a mostly white area., I never really put much thought to this topic,so
45081_5,"By Muslims putting themselves in Christians shoes, people are able to open their minds up to new opinions.","By Muslims putting themselves in Christians shoes, than people are able to open there minds up to a more complex thinking.",if
43579_2,The United States will not stop doing airstrikes., I do hope they are more careful.,because
44190_4,Many movies depicted Muslims in a certain light.,Many movies depicted people of Middle Easter descent in a certain light.,and
45412_3,I believe almost everyone nowadays is scared passing a cop.,Everyone nowadays is scared getting pulled over by a cop.,and
46161_2,it was interesting to see their perspective about wearing it.,it gives you a different perspective because your not worried about yourself and able to look out in the world without so much worry. and See the world with less concern and less fear.,and
45197_2,Columbus came to this new world.,There were already people here.,and
43292_1,We can try to do research on companies like Primark.,They profit off of foreign labor like what Bassim mentioned.,Nan
43525_4,We cannot create laws that are based on a single religion.,Not everyone practices the same religion.,as
44904_1,I learned that is has already been ten years. ,The place is under all kinds of conflict. ,and
44074_1,The system may be based on religion.,Then it is one person's  or a group of people's interpretations that determines what happens to someone.,if
46374_1,The first thing was made pretty clear to me.,We overlook black history.,and
45696_3,I think Basim ability to forgive is a lesson to everyone.,Holding a grudges it does more damage to you.,if
45026_2,He simply allows himself to be human.,He allows his students to be human.,as
43871_1,First off I like how Sam is open minded.,Sam incorporates multiple religions into his life.,and
43950_3,Those teachers that teach their knowledge.,Those teachers that preach about life.,as
46068_1,Sam said in the video.,White people set things up.,as
45862_2,Black people had more in depth knowledge why the white people had historically thought of these crimes as okay.,They could explain why the white people had historically thought of these crimes as okay.,and
44118_5,It makes us naive to those around us.,"Makes us naive ot the beliefs not being able to discuss religion, at a younger age especially makes us ignorant",and
43820_1,He is mighty and great. ,Why does he need people to protect him?,so
44704_3,Sam asked the girl sitting on the white side.,He asked how the pictures made her feel.,when
44751_3,I think too often its easy to just shut off the news.,I think too often it's easy to walk away from a political conversation.,because
43183_2,The main thing that I have taken from it is how the news outlets are biased.,They are steered towards either the left or the right.,and
44450_4,We continue to turn a blind eye.,Who are we to say we are better than the people bombing towns?,and
45884_2,"The white people in history were always the ones on top,",Sam said.,and
42873_1,I am proud to be Christian.,I also understand the things that a few Christians have done that give us a bad name.,Nan
44315_3,It is sad.,I  dont see the conflict ending any time soon.,and
44936_8,Does it get too hot underneath?,Do they wear the hijabs all day?,if
46378_1,The other major point that stuck out to me was the statistics surrounding employment.,Especially the white man with a criminal record versus the black man with a clean record.,Nan
46306_7,Most of the people in the lower levels were black.,creating a tough context for the black people.,Nan
45666_6,my entire reason why i am living is my friends.,they are gone I don't know  I could ever move on from that and forgive the people who did it.,and
45216_3,I  am more aware of what other people around the world have to go through.,I  am more aware of what other people in our community have to go through.,and

44240_2,We are confused how Basil forgave these people. ,Try and speak to the Americans as if we didn’t destroy his life. ,so
45121_1,It was  engaging.,everyone seemed to be speaking from their heart.,and
46326_3,"They seem to have control over wealth, stuff, they do not want to give up to black people.",They are not unequal like the reconstruction period.,and
45069_1,This surprises me so much.,Here's what we are taught to believe.,because

46407_3,Simply being a minority cannot be the excuse.,The excuse why you are not able to make it.,Nan
44893_3,Sam was talking about divorce.,People turn to the Bible in order to handle the aspects of divorce.,and

44161_1,That it is the news that we hear about.,It is skewing our perception of what is really happening in our society.,Nan
43114_4,majority of Christians are white people.,They dont think about terrible things.,because
46187_1,t is true that many people who have encountered this phrase believe that black people only care about their own.,It is untrue in many aspects.,Nan
43449_1,"Religion, like many other facets of culture, can be hard to define.",Religion can fall victim to sometimes harsh opinions.,and
43770_1,the governmen.,There is corruption in,as
44108_1,We need to take initiative.,We need to want to know what is happening.,and
44739_2,The volunteer students made comments to each other.,The volunteer students attempted to back up a party that they are foreign to.,and
45448_2,He wants to end DACA.,He wants to end many things.,and
46195_2,"In some Middle Eastern societies, it can be a punishable offence that a woman dress like they do in our western society. ",I do believe this limits their freedom. ,for
45667_3,It might not register to you.,It didn't happen to the people of your color.,because
44397_2,Social media plays a huge role.,Young Americans receive news and information.,Nan
45804_8,They know.,They want to sway believers using false evidence.,because
45418_5,"All I would be able to think would be, Why couldnt it be me?",Basim should be someone that everyone aspires to be.,because
44752_2,It's in a good way.,He makes us talk about them.,and
44358_1,"This is harder to do on the other side, in terms of Muslim practitioners.",They are an incredibly small percentage in the United States.,because
43159_1,We will always have crazies.,Crazies who make their own interpretation.,and
43230_2,He has been vocal about instilling a wall.,He has been vocal about reforming Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).,Nan
45876_3,It does a lot of the time show us.,We want to see.,because
42984_1,This has happened.,It happens at a minuscule rate compared to many countries in the Middle East.,so
44368_1,These terms  get thrown around.,labels get thrown around.,and
45321_1,It is interesting how the world works.,How we are linked to people all around the world.,so

44820_3,Basim chooses to turn the other cheek.,Basim chose to continue on being strong and living his life.,and
44389_1,Is that safety worth it?,Do stories like Basim have to occur?,if
44046_1,"That being said, your point about ISIS and The KKK is very valid.",I have not previously considered this point.,and
43277_3,It would mitigate ethnic conflicts.,"They stem from information we gain online, not directly.",and

45626_3,People don't realize how unequal things are.,Some people haven't been told how unequal things are.,because
46020_4,People are focusing too much on this issue.,There are many other things that need to be brought to the attention of the public.,when
44455_1,I thought it was very sexist.,Men forced women to cover up.,because

45058_2,It is great that many people are supporting Puerto Rico in this time of need.,It is great that many people are gathering supplies for Puerto Rico in this time of need.,for
44706_3,History repeats itself.,"Being a white person, she was able to recognize that.",as
45380_3,I do support their right to free speech.,There are better ways to show your opinions.,because
43637_1,"Therefore, it is of the upmost importance that Americans learn more about other people in the world.","Therefore, it is of the upmost importance that Americans learn more about other people , through our media.",Nan
45671_1,To me that just sounds like slavery again.,Just not called slavey.,Nan

44191_3,People pick and choose what works for them.,People ignore the parts that would make themselves look bad.,Nan
46488_3,we are equal now for the most part.,we lack equity.,Nan
44674_5,Basim did not look to his religion for answers.,The man would be very different.,because
43154_1,Chaos brings viewership.,Viewership brings advertising dollars.,Nan
42909_1,This is a false equivalency but has led to a lot of misconceptions about Muslim people,I think this is where a lot of Islamaphobia comes from in 2017,and
45818_1,Women who wear Hijabs were brought to the front of the class.,It was to have a conversation with women who don't.,Nan
46033_1,I personally have never been to the Middle East.,I found it unbelievably fascinating.,so
43232_3,It is like white policeman who shoot unarmed black men.,Armed black men have guns legally.,and
44816_1,Assuming there was an attack by ISIS.,Similar to the one on Basims house.,if
43655_1,I think here is even worst.,Than many places due to a few reasons.,for
43736_1,all we hear about the Middle.,East in the laws make.,because
43182_3,This makes American look like a super hero coming into a country.,This is definitely not the case for !/:/8@,and
43911_1,"Personally, this class almost had me in tears.",I was shocked when he told us that Basim was waiting on skype to talk to us.,and
44650_1,It is not up to me. ,I can’t tell people what to wear. ,and
46435_1,This magnificent land stretches thousands of miles.,I have been to it quite a few times.,for
43713_2,These people look.,These people look ,and
44579_1,He viewed all the Presidents the same.,This was made to think about that.,Nan
46131_1,"As Americans, we have much more freedom than we understand.",we have much more freedom sometimes in the little aspects.,Nan
44198_9,It devastates me to hear it.,see all the problems in the middle east.,and
44038_4,it was done by a group of Muslims., the media did what they do best which is to generalize. ,and
43683_4,This man is able to forgive Americans for what happened to his family.,Everyone should be able to forgive.,if
45394_5,Black people talked like modern day white people.,Their statements epitomized what uneducated white people sound like.,because
45887_1,The three white people at the front of class understood the black's side.,The white people got upset that the black people did not care to listen.,as
43479_4,I have only been exposed to a certain thing.,the same thing.,Nan
43286_1,My dad grew up in Poland,My dad went to school in Poland.,and
46405_7, I will refer to white people black people like black people,t flipped like in the lecture to reduce confusion.,as
44372_1,Politicians all talk themselves up.,Politicians claim that they will fix what the last man in a position of power ruined.,and
43342_1,I think were all looking for that fairy tale answer.,"We want him to say, yes, Iraq can one day go back to normal.",Nan
43771_4,an assumption would be that the foreign policy for Iraq would be different,according to Basim there all the same nothing is different.,so
44847_1,This was one of my favorite classes.,I thought it was awesome to see the role switched.,because
46330_3,I heard about how vast it is.,I heard about how large it is.,and
45667_2,It might not register to you.,It didn't happen to the people of your color.,and
45659_1,News channels do not show a white person being killed by a police officer.,News channels do not have to show white people being killed.,Nan
44647_5,The statistics prove that black people have been placed in an unfair position.,Black people are persecuted.,as
45831_4,His strength is inspiring.,I hope that he will be able to share his story with more Americans.,and
43412_1,I've learned over the years that you never really know what goes on in the government.,Many secrets are obviously kept within them.,and
45020_4,They should basically just get over it,It happened in the past.,because
42783_1,Our conversation with Basim opened up my eyes.,he explained how he moved on from the anger through his religion.,when
45744_2,We cannot simply just move on.,His next picture is a group of wealthy black business men from 1859.,and
44144_1,The same principle applies to Steph Curry rejecting Trump's invitation.,It definitely comes down to individual choice.,Nan
44671_1,This was interesting., I have seen faithful people.,because
46175_1,A friend of mine watched it on the stream,"He told me to look, thus looking back it now at 4:38 second of this video,",and
44139_1,I mean he lost EVERYTHING.,"He was just an innocent man living his life with his family in his home, just like us.",and
45262_1,There's a large amount of uneducated people in the United States.,It was very evident in the last election.,because
46304_1,"The less time we spend judging one another, the more time we have to build relationships. ",That’s important! ,and
43164_4,Unarmed blacks are killed by the police., now sticks out in my mind.,Nan
43519_1,I totally agree with this statement.,We are busy being judging people.,because
44982_2,Each person has the right to be an individual.,They should be able to believe in whatever they please.,and
45067_3,It was incredibly interesting.,Consider what we're often told by those in/running for office.,and
45504_3,It opened the eyes of many individuals.,Individuals that don't think there is a difference in the way blacks are treated.,because
43671_1,We need this open-mindedness ,We need this open-mindedness ,as
43171_1,Many of these players have every right to kneel.,They will continue to do so with or without the constant badgering of the President,and
44377_2,Nothing has changed,Something has to happen in order to help these people.,for
43320_1,I think we tend to think this way towards the Sharia.,at first glance it doesn't seem to be similar to our way of life.,because
45610_3,Many things have led up to how Iraq is today.,America  invaded.,when
45138_1,I like how you gave a personal experience of your own.,He lived in various countries.,and
44415_3,I shouldnt categorize any Muslim as part of the Taliban.,They might share completely different ideals.,if
43097_2,it make feel good.,It really makes me wonder though.,if
46314_3,Like you'd said.,For other individuals to connect over their experiences.,for
46034_2,You mean.,Let the student from Oman speak about his experiences.,Nan
44775_1,There is one simple truth about the tension between races. ,It is because white people do not care. ,so
44736_1,I wish history had been written this way.,I feel like many people would not be fans of this conquest.,if
43325_1,"His wife, daughter, and dog were all killed in a bombing that was initiated by the United States government.",Stacy asked how he wasnt angrier with the United States.,and
44875_4,They are facing it.,My knowledge only skims the surface.,and
46309_2,You think the civil war was a step forward.,Slavery was stopped.,because
44470_2,We wanted to exploit their resources.,"It goes against everything we, as humans, should stand for.",because
43688_2,This was a strong reminder about him being a Muslim.,He should forgive.,because
42871_6,We don’t truly understand what we are. ,We don’t truly understand who we are. ,and
43307_4,They are held back by their poor economic status.,This is compared to white people.,as
43941_2,The United States government still invaded Iraq.,That is very telling of the real motives behind the war.,Nan
43990_2,It is just a normal city being destroyed by hate.,It is much easier to feel sympathy.,Nan
46189_1,To touch on the taking a knee when the national anthem plays.,I think that it is a peaceful protest.,and
46422_1,I was able to learn about her culture.,I was able to learn about the rules.,and
43716_1,It would have tainted my view of people.,That weren't associated in the conflict at all.,Nan
45955_3,They have never felt it.,They could never really understand it.,and
44178_3,Something like that happened to me.,I would not be able to forgive the people who did that to me.,and
45377_2,Americans break codes against the flag on a daily basis.,It is never seen as disrespectful,and
46294_4,I am proud of that scar.,I am not embarrassed or ashamed of it.,and
42908_2,These men caused damage to America.,They caused a lot of pain.,for
43040_3,We should make generalizations about Muslims.,"Like you said, not everyone in a particular group arent the same.",because
45995_3,I knew that it was a simulation.,The roles in the simulation were switched.,and
46322_1,I thought it was a good point.,He brought up how ending slavery might leave them worse off.,when
45649_5,It's unfair for black people., even other non-white minority groups.,and
45184_2,I think about if they did the same thing for a different topic.,I think about if they did the same thing for anything else.,and
43874_4,"He mentions we hear about Muslims killing other people, how they are terrorists, etc.",Sam is right.,when
43601_1,It makes it easier to understand the reason why some of these hate groups are formed against the United States.,They are particularly from groups in the Middle East.,Nan
46119_1,"Among a few of my friends in the class, we were very divided on the effectiveness of the class.",There's no debate about it.,Nan
45231_1,This is just wrong.,It is a core detriment to we Americans as a people.,and
44546_1,I also liked how Dana started the lecture off.,Dana made Amin Bailey sing a native song for the class.,Nan
44440_1,Eric Garner was selling cigarettes outside a storefront.,The police choked him to death.,and
43695_1,We are young.,We are only really exposed.,when
45804_3,They actually don't believe it.,They know.,and
42798_3,It was not because of his intense fear of Isis.,His entire family has relocated .,because
44991_10,It would be quite eye opening.,helpful to most people who live in a community of different ethnicity together.,and
44057_2,It's to star a converstation.,That talks about change.,and
46311_3,I couldn't believe the statistics showed in the slides about the present.,I couldn't believe the projected statistics about the future.,and
45908_2,I am going to respond to the second half of the lecture.,A couple of girls in class came up wearing hijabs.,when
43474_1,It's funny how individuals choose to deal with their pain.,I have come to realize something.,and
46476_6,They got to hear each other out.,and put themselves in each others shoes.,and
45967_2,It would inspire people to become better.,It would inspire people to do something.,and
43699_1,We need to choose to learn about other religions.,We need to go through personal growth.,and
43915_1,Forgiving those who hurt you takes a lot of strength. ,Learning how to live all over again takes a lot of strenght.,and
44020_1,So much was taken away from him.,So much was taken away from innocent families.,and
45811_1,The human species cannot advance if we continue to segregate.,We cannot advance if we fight over race.,and
45694_1,It is very sad.,The horrible things caused this event.,because
46282_6,You cannot use them they are not a backbone of beliefs.,"We all can see, it is easy to skew numbers in someones favor.",as
45413_2,You actually researched an issue that you felt strongly towards.,Rather than just relying on what was said in class.,Nan
43986_2,There are many bad perceptions of different places in the world., We can choose to believe them.,so
43291_2,It is outrageous,we should try not to support slavery like this,and
45863_3,The white people could only base themselves on surface knowledge.,The only people could only base themselves on things that were presented in the media.,and
45561_2,I was shocked.,The girls were shocked.,as
45197_4,There were already people here.,He named those people Indians.,as
46253_1,It is very hard to keep those in heart when all of those are going on. ,There is no date for the ending.,and
43518_1,Sam mentioned how it is easy to see people from over there.,It is more difficult to see it in our own world.,for
46316_1,Being able to see someone elses viewpoint and perspective allows you to grow as a person.,Being able to see someone elses viewpoint help you form your own opinions on what you think is right.,and
44755_3,They personally are not judging them.,They're alone or among other women.,when
43785_1,I believe this class was very eye opening to many.,Hopefully a lot of people got things out of it.,and
45291_3,I think some of the points got lost in translation.,I was a white person sitting in the classroom.,because
44841_1,Yes people are wrongly killed.,A loss of a life is a loss of a life.,and
45193_3,There are people who blindly follow without challenging ideas and theories.,There are people who blindly follow without finding out the truth for themselves.,and
46325_3,White people did not want to give up what they had to black people.,White people created a system that allowed them to stay on top.,and
44216_1,It was eye opening to be put in the position of thinking.,We were in someone else's shoes.,if
43555_3,It is so easy to be informed.,Things are going on around us.,Nan
45142_5,I took it  have an open mind.,try to understand where other comes from  ofjumping toconclusions.,as
46199_4,It is like a Christian with a cross necklace.,Nobody is forced to wear those things except the hijab.,and
45395_4,My white friends couldn't pass the literacy test.,My white friends couldn't get jobs that required qualifications.,if
45013_1,Sam released the statistics.,It's safe to say we were all shocked.,when
46165_1,I think we can aware people around us,We can open such discussion.,Nan
46079_1,I saw things in a different perspective.,I hope that other people can see post slavery reconstruction in the same way.,and
46414_1,Those that were killed were mostly White people.,Those who did not attempt to flee the scene were mostly White people.,and
43016_1,Its important to see people in a way that you want to be seen by them.,I agree that sometimes people in the U.S. do not have this mindset.,Nan
44190_3,ISIS and other terrorist groups happened.,Many movies depicted Muslims in a certain light.,so
45119_4,People want you to think that more black people are being killed by police officers.,It is the opposite.,when
44886_2,My parents taught be things about the Bible. ,It has become less important to me over the years. ,Nan
46045_1,He said releasing the hate has made him a better person.,Its not good to hold grudges against people.,Nan
45031_2,It's why we fail to wrap our heads around this concept.,Most of us have never been exposed to other cultures other than our own.,because
46022_2,The media focuses on the issue more than natural disasters.,The natural disasters happen in other countries.,because
43907_1,"For example, Muslims say that Christians are bad far less than the amount of times Christians say Muslims are bad.",there's just a larger amount of a default Christian argument of Muslims are bad than there is for Muslims to defaultly argue Christians are bad,so
44162_3,Issues are happening in society.,That means looking up information themselves.,for
44272_1,This makes us a nation seem very ignorant.,distant to other nations.,and
43657_2,Those images started spreading fast.,"Eventually, the whole world start seeing these. ",and
46392_1,Flipping our history was eye-opening to me.,Explaining our history was eye-opening to me.,and
43012_1,It is a lesson we can apply to situations that arise in our own lives.,It is a lesson we should apply to situations that arise in our own lives.,and
43805_4,Football is one of the most popular viewing spectacles in the United States.,That is exactly what it has done.,as
44764_4,It made them more comfortable.,They feel less under the judgmental eyes of people.,and
44492_3,How  is he not angrier?,Basims life was turned upside.,and
43730_1,The main point of his visit was to inform us about the laws.,The main point of his visit was to dispel any stereotypes that many people might think the law system is really like.,and
43688_4,He should forgive.,He should not hate.,and
43662_3,There are radical Christian groups.,"As Americans, we are never really shown this side of Christianity.",because
43206_2,Tamir Rice was 12 years old.,Tamir Rice was playing in a park as any 12 year old would.,and
45704_2,What if that was happening around my neighborhood?,What if it was happening in my community?,and
46479_1,What really stuck out to me was seeing one of the girls not wearing a hijab.,She said she put one on for the first time.,when
46044_1,He has decided to let go of the hate.,He has decided to forgive.,and
45987_1,Many issues in the world are caused by anger.,Many issues in the world are caused by the unwillingness to see the bigger picture.,and
45708_3,We were about to learn about something bad that had happened.,I had no idea that it would be of such a magnitude.,Nan
43421_5,He is able to smile.,He is able to appreciate what he has.,and
43897_3,We are awakened to reality.,We see what we've all been missing out on all this time.,and
43631_2,The media rarely spends time talking about what is happening in other countries.,"The times they do talk about other countries, the story will be a small headline.",if
44153_1,I just heard all of the horrible things happening in Mosul.,It makes me sad.,for
43532_3,You believe it or not.,Influence is high based off media.,Nan
44967_1,I said previously. ,There are faults in both sides arguments. ,and
45769_1,We are a country that preaches equality.,We are a country that preaches freedom.,and
44463_1,Sam's friend Basim lived in the United States.,"Sam's friend Basim personally experienced both of these worlds, making his message much more powerful.",so
44899_2,I would be consumed by sadness.,I would be consumed by anger.,so
46425_1,She would only wear her hijab the time her family came to visit.,She would only wear her hijab at home.,if
45243_3,Many of the critics are also Trump supporters.,A good question to ask is why they kept quiet.,when
46215_1,I will get a position at a job.,I am not carrying on with this!,Nan
46260_1,Racial inequality is a huge issue today.,Our country does not get the recognition that it needs.,and
45624_1,I really wish.,We were required to take more history classes.,Nan
43388_2,News outlets have been talking non stop about athletes taking the knee during the national anthem.,There are more important things to be talking about.,when
46383_4,I feel that I have a better understanding to how my ancestors grew up.,"Insight into how badly blacks were treated in America, gave me insight.",as
46323_2,But slaves had places to live on the plantations.,Slaves had laws protecting them.,and
44699_1,"As a white female, it has always been hard for me.",It's hard to place myself into the shoes of people of different backgrounds.,Nan
45207_2,It was an approach to get us to think from the other side.,We should think about how the other side would feel.,and
43836_2, Muslims killing each.,People talk about Muslims killing each.,and
45505_2,The blacks were so quick to believe the police report over the man who got arrested.,The man happened to be white.,so
43792_2,the media do not show the entire story.,"this fosters the generalizations that we pass upon a whole group of people belonging to that one religion, even though as we said in class, both Christianity and Muslim are fundamentally the same religions.",as
45256_2,They do not fully understand the spectrum of it.,They do not understand the long period of time that black people had to endure being treated the way they were.,because
43361_6, it is hard to see that Christians could be a part of many horrific hate groups.,it is much easier to see people who are Islamic as bad.,and
43804_1,Whether you disagree or not with the issue they bring up is irrelevant.,it's the fact that they have the simple right to protest in the USA.,Nan
43943_2,The amount of courage and strength a person has to have in order to forgive someone whos wronged them is already really high.,I cannot tell you how much respect I have for Basim.,because
44225_1,This lecture was honestly the first time I head heard about Radical Christianity.,Hearing the comparison of Radical Christianity to Radical Islam. ,Nan
43713_5,These people look , to our president.,and
43240_1,Some countries as you know have actual laws that tell women they have to wear the hijab.,"Some countries though they are majority Muslim like Senegal, could care less.",and
44651_1,Someone feels they want to wear a hijab or a tube top.,By all means go for it.,Nan
46048_1,He is really portraying a good person.,He is being the definition of a good person.,and
46448_1,I thought that is was interesting.,The girls that don't wear hijabs tried them.,when
45241_4,what he did is not disrespectful toward the flag.,"Others do(use it  clothing, napkins, laying it flat horizontally, etc",and
44692_1,"I think, when it comes to the image created about religions it is important, not to feel guilty about being a part of it.","I think, when it comes to the image created about those who follow them, it is important, not to feel guilty about being a part of it.",and
45748_2,Every race needs to have the same amount of privilege.,Not every race has the same amount of privilege yet.,and
44638_2,He was guided to forgive.,He was guided to move on.,and
45891_1,The students talked in flipped roles.,It gave a better understanding what the opposing sides generally face on a typical day.,Nan
43857_3,"The way in which they are being done is unfair, disrespectful, and immoral.","There are better times, places, and ways to affect change.",because
44545_2,Now I can see how to a chief it means dishonor.,We took their ancestors lives.,because
45664_1,We are not put on this earth to go through terrible things like that.,I truly believe that.,if
43965_1,It is a chance to be recognized by the president.,You will be recognized by the whole country.,for
44791_1,I agree with very little of what our military does.,I still feel guilty for all the horrible things happening in other countries.,and
46381_1,Sam said it would be easy.,We called the black people Black Devils.,when
44419_1,That is why I think it is important that we in the United States stop having prejudice against Muslims,That only feeds the hate.,because
44269_1,There is a difference between those who follow a religion.,Those who use it to control others.,as
43236_1,it make feel ok,i like it,Nan
43604_4,That they are more accurate.,because these are real peoples lives at stake.,and
45914_4,It's difficult.,It's awkward.,and
43539_1,I also feel that this class is definitely opening my eyes to many cultures.,I also feel that this class is definitely opening my eyes to many religions,and
44429_1,"Much like Basim, you can sense the anger.",You can tell that he is more than capable.,and
43114_5,majority of Christians are white people.,They dont think about terrible things.,if
45662_2,It really opened my eyes to the truth.,It was not what the media wants us to think.,and
43268_1,Why do some people do a certain thing?,Why do some people continue to assume a certain thing?,so
43310_2,There is a lack of formal education on current polotical issues.,There's a lack of formal education on foreign countries.,and
45793_1,"Historically, this is what happens.", we begin to use the word privilege.,when
43418_1,Keeping our mouths shut will not help solve anything..,Sitting will not help solve anything.,and
44327_1,I love how Sam proposed this fun activity.,Sam called out people who think they have lots of experience.,and
44663_2,He flipped all the statistics around.,It made it seem like history had been this way.,and
45083_1,What I like about this class is the role reversal.,What I like about this class is having different people experience what it feels like being the opposite race.,and
44899_1,I would be consumed by sadness.,I would be consumed by anger.,and
44289_5,These people have struggled enough.,These people deserve a better quality of life.,and
43395_2,he called them SOB,He raises questions of it being racist.,and
44837_1,We can make conclusions from videos that we see.,We don't know all the facts.,Nan
45146_4,Hearing these women say they wear the clothes they do.,They essentially take pride in their religion ,because
46259_2,"I noticed that a lot of students, mainly the white ones, were on their phones.",They were not really paying any attention to what was being said during this class period.,and
45979_1,We often times think the middle east is a war-torn country.,We think the middle east is poor.,as
44589_1,We categorize other people based of race.,We categorize other people based of religion.,and
42888_3,Peoples opinions about the police are not always positive.,They are often viewed as the bad guys.,and
44187_2,I don't think its because most Christians are white.,Europe colonized a lot of the world.,because
45851_5,The perspective on people's mind.,The arts that artists are producing.,and
46349_1,If the same circumstances had happened to me.,I don't think I could learn to forgive.,Nan
46103_1,I never gave the topic much thought.,I was not on the receiving end.,because
43207_2,We don't screen for bias. ,We don't screen for psychopathy. ,because
43351_1,She was able to forgive Joseph Mengele.,Joseph Mengele was a Nazi doctor.,Nan
45946_6,It is because of some heinous acts commetted by cops.,It is because of some heinous acts committed against cops.,for
43575_2,To get some sort of revenge. ,On that government due to harming my family. ,for
46195_3,I do believe this limits their freedom. ,A woman should have total control over what she wants to do with her life and body. ,Nan
46371_1,Some people saw an attack.,The attack was on white people.,and
43493_4,I would like to assume that the United States,I would like to assume that the United States,and
42773_1,I have so much respect for Basim.,I respect what he said.,because
42986_1,Bassim stated,Our school courses do not provide enough information,as
45697_5,Basim's story about forgiving runs in my head.,"Basim can forgive, I should too.",if
43162_2,We were presented with data that was shocking to many regarding the number of Americans killed by police,We were presented with data that was shocking to many regarding the number of Americans unarmed killed by the police,Nan
44967_2,I said previously. ,There are faults in both sides arguments. ,as
43722_2,I think it is very important for people to see this.,It shows a lot of strength.,because
45204_1,This is completely separate.,White people benefit today.,Nan
45434_3,They said they wear things like the American girls across from them.,They wear bikinis in their homes.,when
44041_2,The media have somehow developed the power to choose what gets to be talked about.,The media have somehow developed the power to choose what's not talked about.,and
45707_4,White people imposed horrors on slaves.,Reversing roles made the horrors imposed on slaves feel more personal.,when
46485_6,You have no idea what kind of person they are.,You have no idea who they identify with.,if
46196_2,There have been instances in the news where woman are shamed for expressing themselves in ways that the state does not deem fit.,There have been instances in the news where woman are punished for expressing themselves in ways that the state does not deem fit.,and
44482_1,Written by a part of the country who lost the civil war.,Obviously they aren't going to make them look bad.,so
44940_3, I have never thought of hijabs being sexist.,I remember my senior year of high school reading Persepolis.,when
45459_2,Especially if it sounds like bull crap.,Create your own opinion based on your finding.,and
43731_2,Sharia law is from the people.,many of the stereotypes about.,and
44935_1,I barely saw any hijabs in my area.,I never took the time to research why the women wear it,Nan
43673_1,A war was started by another nation.,It was fought on their own land.,Nan
46196_1,I respect the wearing of the spiritual clothing as a profession of their faith in their religion. ,There have been instances in the news where woman are shamed for expressing themselves in ways that the state does not deem fit.,Nan
44956_1,This was probably the first chance of many others in the room.,"Sitting in discussion, I understood why many chose not to.",as
45367_4,I usually don't talk politics with her to much. ,We heavily disagree on many topics. ,because
44398_2,The internet is constantly showing videos of cops.,The internet makes people believe that thousands of unarmed black people are killed by cops every year.,and
43377_1,You are forced to view others as people that do the same things as you do.,You are forced to view others as people that love their families just like you do.,and
42871_1,Never. ,We live in a bubble. ,and
44720_1,"Overall, this lecture was really powerful.",It helped me to put myself in the shoes of a Muslim person.,and
45469_2,I had no clue when it was appropriate to take the hijabs off. ,These women were with other women or close family.,for
44607_1,I chose the topic of how have the US presidents changed., I thought i might hear an emphatic answer.,because
45744_1,Sams key driver is that slavery is not something to be taken lightly.,We cannot simply just move on.,and
43625_3,I was able to have access to that.,I have met many people from different cultural backgrounds.,so
43265_1,Some of the data might be exaggerated.,It is very hard to argue.,so
45570_2,The video I chose to respond to was Flipping American Racial History: Foundation of America.,Sam flips the roles on black people.,for
44814_1,He was very friendly with many American people.,He wouldnt stereotype everyone into one group of people that bombed his house or killed his family.,and
42815_2,Through school. ,Through social media. ,and
44991_2,The video was mostly just explaining the history.,More people should do what Sam did.,if
44893_2,I found it interesting.,Sam was talking about divorce.,when
46361_3,We had black people be superior on top.,It was kind of odd to me.,and
45971_2,Black people became free.,Black people did not have any place to go.,when
43273_5,"These include Uganda, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo",They propagated horrors such as massacres of innocent civilians and using children soldiers.,Nan
46160_1,I truly believe.,We ourselves define who we are not what we wear.,Nan
46154_1,"If everyone used their strength to forgive, we could strive to find better understanding.",We can improve our society. ,and
44070_2,Why do I have to listen to someone who I cannot hear.,Why do I have to listen to someone who I cannot feel.,Nan
43024_1,"I, myself, have my own opinions on this topic.",I found it fascinating to listen to other peoples views on the protest,Nan
44847_5,It was awesome to hear what the girls had to say about wearing hijabs.,It was awesome to hear what it means to them.,and
46060_1,"When you see something like this, no matter the victim, it should annoy you.",They are doing the exact opposite of what they are meant to be doing.,because
44460_3,It helps women be confident.,Other people would not focus on her looks.,because
45178_4,The white families confused me.,The black families confused me.,and
45210_5,The Black unemployment rate his higher.,The White unemployment rate is lower.,for
45173_1,I am also a Christian.,I do realize how certain things in my religion can be up for interpretation.,and
45604_1,I was always pretty oblivious to this topic.,I did not know much about the Muslim religion at all going into this lecture. ,and
46420_1,"I, too, thought that this class was one of the most interesting ones thus far.",I got the opportunity to get a positive opinion from women who wear hijabs.,because
46086_2,They could be arrested.,It's for not checking in with their superiors.,if
46273_3,It is hard.,It is frustrating.,because
46113_2,It is their fault for racist sterotypes.,Stereotypes remain in our society.,and
45098_4,Teachers thought that we were not mature enough.,That was a topic that teachers did not want to teach younger kids.,because
42995_1,The unfortunate situation is this.,the school truly thinks they are providing us with all the proper resources to do so,Nan
45819_2,"It just seemed like a bunch of girls hanging out, having a normal conversation.",It is how these types of things should be.,because
46141_1,I still don't believe that society is set up to be fair.,It's not just for black individuals.,and
44798_1,Being on the other side is humbling.,:iving in the shoes black people did during those times is humbling.,and
44866_5,Listening in on this lesson I felt arrogant.,Listening in on the lesson i felt naive.,and
45284_2,There are statistics to prove that.,There are factors that go unnoticed.,and
44080_1,Basim goes on to say that there is no difference between Presidents.,They all have the same policy of coming in.,because
44983_1,"you look at it from an outside view, say someone who does not characterize themselves in any religion.","They see that no matter the religion, christians kill, muslims kill.",when
46223_3,Were still more likely to get a call back.,Than black people with the same past convictions.,Nan
45699_1,I used to be so selfish.,I only believed things I knew.,and
45102_2,"War is very harmful, not just to our soldiers.",War is very harmful to the people we attack in other countries.,and
45319_1,Your post was actually very interesting.,Because of the background your grandfather has.,Nan
42956_2,It really opened my eyes to a lot of new things,It changed my attitude for how I should be thinking about different things,and
43079_3,Work along each other to make a change. ,"This is not only affecting us, but future generations.",because
44368_2,labels get thrown around.,Sometimes there is not a lot of attention to how powerful they can be,and
44520_2,I feel like that was done purposefully.,I think  about it.,and
44331_2,The wall building up inside of them.,That distance them with other people.,Nan
44455_3,Men forced women to cover up.,Women would not tempt anyone.,so
46392_2,Flipping our history was eye-opening to me.,Explaining our history was eye-opening to me.,as
43182_2,The ability to focus the nation’s attention on certain aspect of the Iraqi war.,This makes American look like a super hero coming into a country.,and
44946_1,"Again, I liked him fine.",I want a different perspective.,Nan
45889_3,I found it interesting as well. ,the true blacks are actually still dealing with racism to this day.,because
44548_5,His culture had to mix with non-native American culture in terms of his hair getting cut.,Him not having any connections to his family.,because
44951_4,We seem to have fought a civil war over the 2016 presidential election., as Iraq dealt with corruption.,Nan
45017_4,Some black people act like white people.,They talk about their ancestors.,when
43668_3,Everyone should explore every opinion in politics.,Everyone should explore every opinion in religion.,and
44615_1,The biggest American issue in Iraq is oil.,The biggest American issue in Iraq is increasing our profits from the resource.,and
44178_2,Something like that happened to my family.,Something like that happened to me.,if
46517_3,Someone wears a hijab.,The ladies said they did not judge them based on their outfits.,for
46319_2,The issues that dominated our society will only help us come to resolution,The issues that dominated our society will only help us to fix these problems.,and
44307_2,The Iraqi haven't seen any real progress.,The Iraqi haven't seen change in the last 14 years.,for
44956_3,This was probably the first chance of many others in the room.,"Sitting in discussion, I understood why many chose not to.",so
46198_4,No one should be forced to wear a hijab.,"Forcing  someone to wear it, that infringes on personal freedom.",as
43695_3,Our parents want to show us.,This is typically only what they believe.,and
43463_2,Our nations security is definitely of the utmost importance.,I am in no way saying we should not be cautious.,and
43661_5,"the Middle East is not being exposed to their actual culture, belief, or way of life we are naive",the Middle East is believe what we are told.,and
44344_1,I found his response to be humane.,He stated that his religion teaches him to forgive.,and
45160_1,I thought they were forced., their religion.,Nan
44499_2,It changed everything for the people living there.,It converted everyone to radical Islam.,Nan
45914_6,It's awkward.,you know that you are being insensitive.,and
45655_2,They affect how people perceive things.,They affect how people decide what they want to believe is true.,and
45298_3,Truly diving in is nearly impossible.,Understanding what exactly you're supposed to be seeing is nearly impossible.,and
43214_3,"to be questioned, because.",The are meant to be interpreted.,because
43817_1,This only instills fear.,It is likely the reason most people won't ever travel to the middle east.,and
44889_2,I  go to church every often with my parents.,It has always been somewhat boring to me.,so
44495_1,I gained so much respect for this man. ,I loved his willingness to speak to us. ,so
44469_3,I would like to believe him.,I don't think I will be able to forgive something like this.,as
43553_5,It is important that we try to educate people more on what is going on.,It's about why they should care.,and
43080_1,People need change.,They need help from countries that are not just interested in their natural resources. ,and
45843_1,This is challenging yourself.,Do not generalize people.,Nan
46198_6,No one should be forced to wear a hijab.,"Forcing  someone to wear it, that infringes on personal freedom.",when
45095_1,Sam flipped the roles.,Sam set aside the emotions but kept the facts.,Nan
45577_2,I feel how I would feel,I was the one who was getting this kind of unjust treatment in America,if
43262_6,It's in the news a few weeks.,It takes up a lot of our attention.,for
42877_1,I feel it is important to do something in my life.,Something that can benefit everyone.,if
45304_6,The cop was doing a white person's job.,I have never experienced these issues first hand.,because
42871_5,We live in a bubble. ,We don’t truly understand what we are. ,because
44279_2,She explained she was't extremely affected by the Blue Lives Matter movement.,He does not work in a high crime rate area.,as
45562_2,It is likely that I think this.,It is the prevalence of social inequality in our country.,because
44697_2,Slavery is a huge part of our foundation.,It was shown in the lecture.,as
45884_4,Sam said.,They ran our country.,and
45666_2,It isn't healthy to hold onto anger  long.,my entire reason why i am living is  my family.,for
45141_4,I agree that we have to be able to have empathy to one another.," we all different upbringing , we all go through different trials.",for
43722_3,It shows a lot of strength.,I think everyone could benefit from acting the same way.,and
43618_1,If everyone looked at things with an open mind there would be less controversy.,If everyone looked at things from a different view there would be less controversy.,and
45435_2,The American women put on the hijabs at the end.,"One girl made a lighthearted comment about not having to worry about her hair.,",when
44880_1,It is hard at times to convince a white person that these problems and this discrimination exists.,Black people started funding and conducting research to be able to provide further evidence to prove their claims.,so
44994_3,People are unable to put themselves in the shoes of others.,People are unable to think about what they are feeling.,because
44055_1,It said that African Americans had less of a chance to land a job.,Even when they had the same qualifications as someone who is white.,Nan
43304_1,Let's take an example.,Jared Kushner got accepted into Harvard.,Nan
45070_5,It seems we have done nothing.,It seems we have made things worse for the people of the Middle East.,if
45372_1,The situation really bothered me.,The situation really bothered my mom.,and
44701_1,I was confused about a comment a black man said.,The sitting black man said that history is history.,when
43068_2,They did not.,I cannot blame them.,Nan
45380_2,I do support their right to free speech.,There are better ways to show your opinions.,because
45727_2,He had a lot of anger built up inside of him.,He had to just let it all out.,and
44807_1,It all does seem strange to me.,It all does seem extreme to me.,and
43227_1,Americans generally have a very limited view of what goes on in other countries,This is why Basim's advice rings so true,Nan
45466_1,It really showed how ignorant actual white people were during the Civil Rights movement.,"The tradition of discrimination America was founded on, is deeply rooted into the government and social mindsets.",as
45860_3,You see how poorly people were treated.,It was the color of their skin.,because
46083_2,They chose to give them nothing.,Reconstruction took place during this time.,so
43665_4,That the media coverage of the Middle East is negative.,That the good in all Muslims is never shown to the average Americans.,so
43116_3,nowadays their children and teenagers were being brainwashed in a such a horrible way.,they want them to fight for themselves.,because
46379_1,How is it that we let skin color affect situations like these?,The right choice is  obvious.,so
45205_2,White people's power in the past set them up for advantages today.,Any race could have ended up on top.,and
43579_3, I do hope they are more careful.,These are real people's lives at stake.,and
44850_1,The girls put the hijabs on the students who don't usually wear them.,They said things like it felt like they had long hair.,when
43950_4,Those teachers that preach about life.,"Those teachers more importantly care about you as a human being, not just another number.",and
44047_4,There are similarities between Catholics and Muslims.,They are based on relatively the same premise.,when
46353_3,Call it their problem.,It's harder to act like an adult.,for
45412_2,Many cops abuse their power no matter what color you are.,I believe almost everyone nowadays is scared passing a cop.,so
44143_1,I honestly can't think of a more respectful method of protest.,I honestly can't think of a more non-violent method of protest.,for
44264_1,"No matter what goes on in this world, everything goes back to having compassion for one another.","At the end of the day, we're all human.",because
42908_3,They caused a lot of pain.,They claimed it was in the name of Islam.,and
44258_1,We don't get enough teachings on geography.,A lot of people don't know what's going on in certain countries.,so
43515_1,He says it is due to fact that we live in a Christian world.,We do not see it that way.,because
44517_1,High school graduates all over the world are using the Pocahontas effect to get into college.,High school graduates all over the world are using the 2% native blood they may have in order to grab an edge.,Nan
45372_2,The situation really bothered my mom.,No one is being negatively affected by these peaceful protests.,and
45017_1,Some black people act like white people.,They talk about their ancestors.,and
43187_3,The whole world is enjoying their life.,we should find out about it.,and
46503_2,We all view it in a context lens.,To view it in clarity should tell us this is flat out wrong.,Nan
42824_1,Why would I want to call myself a Christian?,The reputation that Christians have is based on the bad Christians in the news.,if
46041_1,Imagine we were able to forgive the people responsible for the attacks of 9 11 or any other terrorist attacks,we have suffered and were able to separate the small portion of people actually responsible for them from the larger portion of people that were not involved in any way,if
45048_1,This is a way for many to have a sense of the world. ,It’s a different perspective. ,Nan
43657_3,"Eventually, the whole world start seeing these. ",The kids grow up seeing this only makes the situation worst.,and
45622_4,I hope people have the ability to forgive. ,"Myself, I will try to forgive those who might hurt me in the future. ",so
44283_2,It's the statistics of what race of people are.,The ones who have killed the police officers between 1980-2013.,Nan
45472_1,I enjoyed this class lecture too. ,I was very interested in how Muslim women viewd Eastern clothing. ,because
45275_5,I had never considered how weird it would be to be always looking at pictures of groups of white people.,I had never considered how weird it would be to  only seeing my own culture in negative depictions.,and
46191_1,They are being disrespectful  only trying to help.,"They are trying to make a difference, seems disrespectful though.",Nan
45086_2,The men had to sit there.,The men had to pretend.,as
44475_1,The thing is we switch roles.,Any of the things that happened to black had happened to white people.,if
46362_6,A white student respond.,"you have this power ,privilege that you don't see this racism.",and
45256_1,A lot of people do not fully support the black people movement.,They do not fully understand the spectrum of it.,because
45014_1,It's time we start actually doing research.,It's time we start looking deeper into things.,and
45622_3,I hope people have the ability to forgive. ,"Myself, I will try to forgive those who might hurt me in the future. ",as
46112_2,that is the only excuse the black people could come up with during the panel.,Maybe it's actually true.,if
45468_2,How they felt about wearing hijabs. ,I had just never known much about their lifestyles at all.,because
43385_1,I feel some people might not have understood.,The events mentioned throughout the timeline actually happened.,Nan
43060_1,Now the rest of my Grandma family live in small house in Basra.,Each small family has a single room.,Nan

43981_3,I understand it is important for people to have their values.,having those morals is not something that should shut one down from the thoughts.,and
43890_1,"In fact, he mentions.",They are considering reducing wages.,and
42805_1,"That being said, I support the black lives matter movement.",I think.,and
44798_4,:iving in the shoes black people did during those times is humbling.,"It's completely startling, knowing that situations could have easily been flipped had history been opposite.",if
46152_1,I gain strength like Bassim.,I gain wisdom like Bassim.,and
45264_1,We have physical differences.,We have differing IQs and DNA.,Nan
44470_1,We see what our government did to this ordinary family.,We wanted to exploit their resources.,because
45523_3,More people knew the proper statistics.,It would definitely not be a bad thing.,and
44214_2,We went into Iraq because of security fundamental oil.,Our primary motivations for going into Iraq was to get something.,and
45717_1,When we were learning of what the average American would make.,Separated it into black people and white people it really opened my eyes.,Nan
44338_1,I believe that Basim helped people realize that there are acts of war that will forever go untold.,It is up to ignorance of some people to believe that they do not exist.,and
42979_1,A fish is the last animal to understand water.,It's spent its whole life in the water.,because
46434_4,Their exchanges started to carry weight.,"They do today, in reality.",Nan
45223_1,Maybe America wants to create a land of peace here.,That might mean it has to induce chaos abroad.,Nan
46298_1,I totally agree with you about this activity.,I like how conversation-like it felt.,Nan
45897_4,"Time after time, he heard the students in class say phrases.",he found himself saying.,Nan
42893_1,The people he loves most in the world were taken away from him for no reason. ,He has learned to live with that.,and
45262_3,They do not understand culture on the other side of the world.,"More importantly, they've never experienced that culture for themselves.",and
45522_1,I feel.,"This topic is constantly being brought up,",as
43842_1,Make your voice heard. ,Speak for those who cannot.,and
44033_3,It's something embarrassing that we did.,It is an act that can be easily brushed under the rug.,because
46237_2,There is a diversity in that room.,It opens doors to potential answers to questions everyone is thinking.,because
45391_2,I know that African Americans at the time of even freeing slaves were at a complete disadvantage,I had never really thought about it. ,as
44557_2,It is about submerging yourself.,It is about feeling you can make a solid argument.,if
46034_1,I also see.,You mean.,Nan
43797_1,It makes me question why the media never talks about this.,It shows police brutality.,and
44263_4,It is important that we look into the issues ourselves.,We will have a clear idea what is going on.,so
44969_1,To a lot of people it is easier to ignore a problem.,It doesn't concern you.,for
44349_2,We turn a blind eye.,We dont want to hear something.,when
44102_4,It is definitely just a reflection of how important these issues are. ,and their effect on the society that we live in today.,Nan
44081_1,This really made me think about the past elections. ,Especially how politicians will say whatever they need to say to get elected. ,and
42975_6,He can just decide one week what he wants to bring up in class.,that means there was possibly something that made him think of it.,for
45181_5,It’s just their skin pigment that is different. ,They were born in the us. ,if
44237_1,How did he get over the murder of his beautiful wife? ,How did he get over the murder of his daughter?,and
43229_1,In various speeches.,He has said.,Nan
44114_3,How are we supposed to be involved?,How are we supposed to be aware of what is happening around the world?,if
43490_3,There is way on their homeland.,It is simply unfair.,because
45650_1,Toward the end of the class I even started to get annoyed at the responses of the black people.,The white people were making great points for their case.,because
44702_1,"If I were black, I would want the world to learn about my specific racial groups history.",It was intense.,as
45734_3,One third is full of people who want equality.,The last third does not care about anything.,and
46433_3,Was funny hearing the dialogue between white and black representatives.,I think that was one of the most powerful parts.,and
45477_2,I have more respect to them.,It shows how powerful these women are.,because
43660_2,only done by the extremist groups.,We are shown the bad.,Nan
46507_5,it really was a meaningful experience to both the people who participated in the activity., the people who watched.,because
45897_2,He thought.,He never saw other people as less than himself.,Nan
44007_2, Even people close to the matter are soon to choose sides., Even people close to the matter are soon to act upon it.,and
45863_1,the white people had very little knowledge of the struggles that black people have endured for many past decades.,The white people could only base themselves on surface knowledge.,and
45352_2,They want us to see.,We perceive the rest of the world.,so
45227_2,It is our responsibility to find out what is happening out there on our own.,It is our responsibility to develop our own stances.,and
45696_5,Holding a grudges it does more damage to you.,The person you are holding the grudge against.,if
44627_2,I wanted to get out of this class.,It's really helping me do that.,and
46419_2,Do you believe that White people should feel ashamed?,Do you believe that they should pay for their ancestors' mistakes?,and
43262_1,Every time someone is killed it makes the news.,It's the biggest thing online.,and
46346_2,"All of the while, they picnicked.",They gathered together taking pictures.,and
42785_2,All he could do is try to make a difference.,He educates others.,and
44706_2,History repeats itself.,"Being a white person, she was able to recognize that.",and
43098_1,I wanted to include the other video about Bassim's feelings about America,I believe it ties in with the previous one,because
46123_3,Say you pay even minimal attention.,"it will change the way we look at everything, past, present, and future",if
45302_1,This was very confusing.,He talked about the amount of black people who do illegal drugs versus the amount of white people who get arrested for it.,when
43119_3,Everyone's opinion can be irrelevant.,It all depends on persons perspective of how they see religion.,and
44758_4,They did not slut shame them.,It must have been an eye opening humbling experience.,and
43347_1,I know it will be hard.,I truly hope that one day Iraq can begin to mend the damage caused by the war and ISIS.,Nan
45422_1,I think Sam did aI think Sam did a great job almost mediating the group discussion by addressing the general opinion of white people great job almost mediating the group discussion by addressing the general opinion of white people,the general opinion of black people but rather just switching them so white people are feeling as if they are oppressed.,and
45466_3,"The tradition of discrimination America was founded on, is deeply rooted into the government and social mindsets.",People thought it was socially normal to have different schools and different bathrooms for an entire race of people.,as
43950_1,The most important teacher so far for me are those that have become mentors.,Those teachers that teach their knowledge.,Nan
44755_4,They're alone or among other women.,They wear the same things.,and
44884_2,It helped me build my perspective on the world we live in.,It helped me build my perspective on the race in our society.,and
44363_5,Most of us have Christian friends.,"We can say ""Oh wow those Westborough Baptist people are crazy.""",and
45271_3,It opened up their eyes to the fact that it is not just Muslims fighting Muslims.,Other religions do it too.,and
45821_4,They took pride in their beliefs.,It is something to be admired.,and
46247_1,I also agreed with you. ,You said that you believe that the idea of women being oppressed probably comes from an earlier time period.,when
44818_2,The roles were reversed.,Basim had been bombed in America.,if
43200_2,Legally armed minorities are targeted.,Minorities look a certain way.,because
44658_1,"By starting a precedent of acceptance, we can pave ways that future generations can see a person about who they are.","By starting a precedent of acceptance, we can pave ways that future generations can see a person not based on where they are from. ",and
45877_3,This would allow more people to get along.,This would change the stigmas that so many of us have for people.,and
43498_1,I found it extremely eye opening to hear about these events through the eyes of an actual native american.,I found it extremely eye opening to see his reactions whenever a picture would be put up or just simply how we sang and explained what he does for a living.,Nan
44874_1,I don't think there is any way for people to get past this idea of racism.,There's no way for anything to change.,and
45309_1,The point would have been made either way.,I just thought it was an interesting take.,Nan
42805_3,They should definitely fight for equal rights.,They should definitely fight to not be judged based on something that is purely biological.,and
45169_1,I am happy.,I have a new respect.,so
44013_4,They came to Mosul.,He starts talking about what they did.,and
43079_2,Work along each other to make a change. ,"This is not only affecting us, but future generations.",and
45617_2,His religion teach him how to forgive.,Forgive those who did harmful things to him.,Nan
45500_1,People stand around.,People say they want change in the media.,and
45834_2,He gave statistics first.,I'm being completely honest.,if
44048_2,Our view of other cultures in slanted.,I hope this sill change in the near future.,Nan
45624_2,We were required to take more history classes.,These issues are so important.,because
44315_2,They have been fighting for many generations.,It is sad.,as
44407_1,Just like someone interrupt the Qur'an.,They think it's a killing tool.,as
45994_3,He needs to be held at a higher value.,"He is the President, not a late night talk show host.",and
44241_1,One thing that he did say really resonated with me.,He said he felt that anger would just eat him from the inside.,Nan
43382_1,"Being a white woman, I don't understand that fear in relation to the police/police brutality.","It is tragic, the extent of people who have to experience it.",and
45042_4,I think this was a very good idea  Sam to flip the history of black people., I said many white people do not think this sense of racism is around.,as
45446_1,I'm sure it is hard to a president to enact changes.,There are many systems that have to be gone through. ,so
45147_1,I had ignorance about women wearing hijabs.,I thought that this was something that they wore all the time.,because
45298_2,You don't know someone's life.,Truly diving in is nearly impossible.,so
43738_1,There are many terrible accidents happening around the world.,We often do not recognize them.,so
44340_1,Different media sources can choose to publish some articles concerning war.,Different media sources can restrain others.,and
44108_2,We need to want to know what is happening.,I know I personally don't watch the news.,and
45450_3,Who gets elected?,It makes sense.,and
45378_6,Not doing so is also a form of disrespect.,something that should be looked down upon as well.,and
44668_3,Slavery happened a long time ago. ,We don’t have slaves anymore. ,so
43042_4,It highlights violence in the Middle East.,People in the U.S. are more likely to form negative generalizations about the people there.,so
44820_2,There are just many wrong things in this situation.,Basim chooses to turn the other cheek.,so
43790_3,As you said they are mostly white people.,They are usually described in that way rather than a die-hard Christian.,and
46059_4,He swore to make the world better.,and safer place.,and
45315_1,People don't want to hear that it wasn't us. ,I kind of agree. ,Nan
46261_3, The people who created slavery never owned up for their wrong doings., The people who created the Jim Crow laws never owned up for their wrong doings.,because
45755_1,I say selfishly because their situation never once crossed my mind before this lecture. ,After this lecture I couldn't help but think I could be doing something..,and
43884_1,We are constantly judging.,We are constantly making assumptions about people we do not know based on what?,and
44702_7,It was intense.,It was impactful.,so
45561_1,I was shocked.,The girls were shocked.,as
42908_1,These men caused damage to America.,They caused a lot of pain.,and
45816_3,I've come to understand or want to explore things about people.,Before categorizing them from a glance.,Nan
45800_2,all Muslims probably would think that all Americans act as KKK members, thats what they probably see in the news over there.,because
44963_1,A lady led the class last Thursday.,"She said, put one foot in another person's shoe.",as
45794_5,We use this horrid word again.,We will all die.,as
44825_1,All of this was collateral damage.,The collateral damage didn't need to happen.,Nan
45146_1,A lot of people think that Muslim women wear hijabs.,They are forced to rather than them wanting to,because
45701_1,I was one of those people.,I was quick to judge.,so
46419_1,There is one way to look at it.,Do you believe that White people should feel ashamed?,if
43766_3,It speaks a lot to many religions that focus more on forgiveness than cruelty.,It speaks a lot to many religions that focus more on forgiveness than revenge.,and
43449_3,Religion can fall victim to sometimes harsh opinions.,Religion can fall victim to definitions that differ across different communities.,and
43914_2,There are people suffering like this overseas.,It's horrifying to learn.,and
45297_1,Everyone always says to stop.,Put yourself in someone else's shoes.,and
42863_2,Sometimes it is easier for people to hold grudges. ,This is not a healthy way to live. ,and
44151_3,"When we do, there is much talk of improvement and how things will get better",I feel this proves change isn’t easy. ,and
44102_3,Like we’ve been going over international relations for quite a while in this class. ,It is definitely just a reflection of how important these issues are. ,and
44231_1,This is a problem for citizens in the United States.,The only representation that group receives is on the media.,Nan
43109_3,they have been negatively affected by ISIS..,Iraqi citizens have no hope of it returning like it once was.,so
45249_2,I am here at Penn State.,I did not know much about this issue.,so
46128_1,We think they are covered all the time.,"They go on to explain how behind closed doors, in private, they were similar clothes to us.",so
44541_1,I was so ignorant to the fact.,It is so recent.,and
45490_1,Topics involving Police Brutality are often hard to approach.,It will almost always end up with this question.,because
43764_1,The attacks on September 11 were malicious.,They sought to harm people.,and
45892_4,My brother was at Penn State visiting me.,He also sat in on the class.,so
44867_5,Everyone was equal.,They were not their ancestors.,and
45710_1,I think about if I were in his shoes.,I probably would do it. ,Nan
44838_1,We have courts in order to determine.,A person is guilty or not.,if
43378_1,"Karly, I completely agree.",With everything you've said.,Nan
44796_6,This exercise made me feel like one of them.,I could truly feel the suffering they must have felt during the time with this flip flop.,and
43029_2,They are kneeling now.,They did not join Kaepernick last year.,and
44821_3,We should not put everyone in a certain group., one persons actions.,because
42840_3,We should be more aware of these issues.,We should inform other people about them.,and
44764_2,It made them feel safer.,It made them more comfortable.,and
45177_1,It allowed me to see better.,To put myself in a black person's shoes.,and
43141_4,He used biological weapon. ,to gassing and so on.,Nan
43674_1,Many people in the wounded nation.,The rest of their lives are broken.,for
45644_2,I enjoyed watching him.,He called people out for their actions.,and
43607_1,Soc 119 is helping us do this.,Soc 119 is getting us to understand different perspectives.,Nan
43250_2,"During WWII, the ""them"" group were the Germans, who we called monsters.","During WWII, the ""them"" group were the Japanese, who we put into internment camps.",and
44023_1,This makes me question whether the government is there to protect us.,It makes me question them acting in our best interest.,and
42999_1,"In doing so, we may be able to understand how those far different from us live.",We may be able to understand how those far different from us feel.,and
43169_3,"Your black brothers and sisters profiled, attacked, and killed by police and racial injustice.",You feel you have to do something about it.,Nan
45555_3,We made horrible decisions.,They respond saying it was not us.,Nan
46230_1,The girls responded in a way that surprised me a little.,stating that they dont feel pressured in any way.,Nan
46479_5,She did not have to care about her hair.,that she could just see the world without worrying what she looked like.,and
46040_4,It will be a long time before we are able to get rid of all of it.,These are inaccurate stereotypes.,so
45113_3,Im just not sure why.,Someone would look at a black person.,because
43310_6,There's a lack of formal education on foreign countries.,We tend to turn towards the media.,as
42802_2,The conversation regarded black lives matter.,The conversation regarded blue lives matter.,and
46374_5,American history is more important than black history.,Black history didn't directly affect white people.,because
45666_4,my entire reason why i am living is  my family.,my entire reason why i am living is my friends.,and
46160_3,"It was our personality, traits, characteristics, or even actions.",It was really awesome seeing the experiment Sam did.,Nan
44586_1,I really enjoyed your response. ,I agree that all humans should possess empathy. ,and
44458_1,It was a huge eye-opener.,I now understand why women are so proud to wear it.,because
46022_3,The media focuses on the issue more than natural disasters.,The natural disasters happen in other countries.,so
46130_1,It is such an interesting deal of the country.,It puts in place that women must wear these clothes.,Nan
44040_1,The media plays a big part in why a double standard exits.,The media plays a part in why we only hear about certain things.,and
43481_2,That shows different situations.,That shows different cultures.,and
45649_1,This stuck with me.,It was probably the key time during the class.,because
43699_4,Personal growth isn't the job of our parents.,Personal growth is the responsibility we owe ourselves.,and
43990_3,It is much easier to feel sympathy.,It is much easier to be more against what is going on.,and
45817_1,We are always hearing about Muslim terrorists.,We are always hearing about foreign dangers.,and
42989_1,"We have many refugees and immigrants here, both legal and illegal.","They came from around the world, and lost everything.",Nan

45355_3,Osama Bin Laden took credit for.,Al-Qaeda took credit for.,and
43216_1,"For example, the Bible says, “Love thy neighbor.”",What if that neighbor commits a violent crime? ,Nan
44775_2,It is because white people do not care. ,They do not have to. ,and
45182_7,"At first, I think they found it hard to get into character.",They found it hard to find something to say.,and
44447_4,A police pulls them over.,All the events has happened.,because
43237_4, who were wrongly killed ,I never uttered the pledge of allegiance.,Nan
46367_1," I am white, seeing pictures of slaves hurts.",I hope that many people don't just look past those photos.,and
43337_1,I know when I voted this year.,it ultimately came down to each candidates character.,Nan

45003_5,He did not use that disgust on neo-nazis.,He did not use that disgust on white supremacists.,and
45034_2,Sam Richards referred to us putting ourselves in other's shoes.,It is an intellectual challenge.,as
45782_3,They were in fear for their life.,How fair is that?,and
46197_1,I believe we human beings we have the right to absolute freedom.,We complete autonomy in regards to personal decisions. ,and
44658_5,"By starting a precedent of acceptance, we can pave ways that future generations can see a person not based on where they are from. ","By starting a precedent of acceptance, we can pave ways that future generations can see a person not based on what they are wearing.",and
45483_2,People are having their freedom taken away. ,We Americans take that for granted.,and
44024_3,He focused on the  average.,This is how a middle class citizen would view what was happening.,Nan
45241_6,what he did is not disrespectful toward the flag.,"Others do(use it  clothing, napkins, laying it flat horizontally, etc",as
44326_1,We tend to put people into different labels by the first look we have of them.,We tend to put people into different groups by the first look we have of them.,and
43943_5,I cannot tell you how much respect I have for Basim.,He was able to forgive.,because
45482_6,They cut their ankles.,was truly eye opening.,and
43569_4,He had to go through.,So many people in Mosul had to go through.,and
46315_2,Which was refreshing.,An extremely educational experience for me.,and
46455_1,"It is interesting to think that we, western women, who can expose most of our bodies in public according to our cultural rules.",The more skin we expose the more we are objectified by men.,when
45937_1,How are African Americans supposed to have the same opportunities?,they aren't provided the same resources to achieve their goals.,when
45495_1,We do our law enforcement officers a disservice by not better prepping them well..,Making fast decision in a field where their lives are at stake.,for
46185_3,It wasn't a teacher.,They'd probably know nothing about it really.,Nan
45746_2,Racism exists today.,Blacks are forced to fight its beliefs.,and
43480_3,They taught the same thing.,I am Christian.,because
46193_6,Some aspects of the hijab are expressions of religious beliefs.,The hijab can be used to suppress personal freedom.,as
43148_2,We could find blame to be aimed at any direction.,We really wanted to.,if
45235_3,NFL player Colin Kapernick chose not to stand during the national anthem.,Traditionally played at sporting events.,when
43329_1,The amount of strength and faith a person has to have to be able to overcome the murder of the majority of his family without feeling anger or resentment is absolutely absurd., I cant fathom how he was even able to do so.,and
46192_1,It was nice hearing from people who tie the head dress into their own identity.,They see where they are coming from.,and
44097_1,Puerto Rico was just demolished by multiple Hurricanes.,We barely see it in the news anymore.,and
44386_1,I feel guilty.,I often support the government that took Basims world from him..,because
42861_5,I admire his unbiased opinion towards american people.,Even with what happened to him and his family due to the U.S.,for

46166_2,"n addition to what you said, I found it not wrong that athletes represented their feeling in the stadium.",I think their main purpose was not disrespecting military.,and

44937_3,They have different reasons.,They have different religions.,and
45935_5,Most people don't believe it.,they don't have to face it daily.,because

44673_2,It is what they rely on to get by everyday.,It is where they look for answers.,and
45300_2,It made me think.,I really did learn something from it.,because
43442_2,This is the stereotypical way we view Muslims.,He says this is not everyone.,and
43975_1,It cannot be just one person that is shocked by something as realistic as this.,I bet many of you in this class were stunned by his thought as well.,and
43534_5,It is the lack of awareness.,and very high ignorance to a reality that isnt one's own reality and we need to fix that.,and
46243_1,It is our duty to teach ourselves.,We should learn about the world that surrounds us.,Nan
45255_1,Also after seeing all of the arguments some people who do not defend black peoples right say being said there.,they seemed even worse than they already did after all of the facts.,Nan

43089_1,The self-centered attitude among many Americans might be acceptable in a world.,The ignorance might be acceptable.,and

44146_1,It's sad that we basically completely hate these people.,They aren't mad at us.,so
45633_1,There was a reason this country was created.,Outsiders can have a chance at being happy in this country.,so
45326_2,It made no difference to Basim.,The American President made no difference to Basim.,for
45445_5,Trump's supporters know what he says is wrong.,Trump's supporters know what he does is wrong.,when
46298_3,I wish more people were open to discussing these topics with one another.,I am a little hesitant to believe everyone was being totally honest.,and
45339_1,I get the right to protest,The flag does not discriminate,Nan
43043_2,I could not really find the words to express all the different emotions that I felt.,I found out that people lost everything and in many cases.,when
44920_1,In this country everyone has the right.,Everyone has the freedom to do whatever they please.,and
43364_3,Muslims aren't more violent than Christians.,We are all very similar.,so

43230_3,He has been vocal about reforming Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).,"He calls them names, especially illegal immigrants,",and
46108_1,I thought this was a really good way.,It effectively gets the point across.,Nan
44488_2,I found out.,Basim  was going to speak to our class.,when
44082_1,The world watched Trump say whatever came to his mind the moment it popped into his head.,It changed U.S. politics forever.,as
46405_6, I will refer to white people black people like black people,t flipped like in the lecture to reduce confusion.,and
44753_3,Sam discussed the Muslim faith.,Many people thought they were totally different.,and
45258_6,I don't want to distance myself from the issue.,It does not affect me.,because
45017_5,They talk about their ancestors.,They talk about what happened in the past with slavery.,and
45743_2,"They don't understand how big a deal the slave trade was in black history,","They don't understand how big a deal the slave trade was in American history,",for

46506_3,I have been attentive to the past two week's discussions.,I feel like I have a lot to say about the time period's classes.,because
44870_2,People are  just uneducated.,People are simply naive.,and
42975_4,He can just decide one week what he wants to bring up in class.,that means there was possibly something that made him think of it.,and
43287_2,I know our history classes are all about white history in the United States.,The only time we ever even consider exploring other topics.,and
45600_3,They did not notice the inequality of black people.,This has shifted to the violence some police officers inflict on black people.,and
43514_1,Sam mentions how many people talk about Muslims killing Muslims.,There is never any talk about Christians killing Christians.,Nan
45020_2,They should basically just get over it,It happened in the past.,and
44644_1,"He asked if I had bothered to take a white history class, where you could learn something about the history you created.",This was interesting to me because I have always seen myself as not contributing or elevating to racial problems in society today.,Nan
45704_1,I could not even imagine.,What if that was happening around my neighborhood?,Nan
45636_1,It was interesting how Sam had our class switch roles.,Sam made people look at America's history.,and
45942_3," police brutality, killing black people",its interesting to look at the statistics of police brutality,and
44488_1,It made it even more powerful to me.,I found out.,when
45414_1,It is particularly a difficult situation in the USA.,Most people here are Christians.,and
44382_2,They had a right to be angry at the United States.,The attack was given on the order of their leaders.,because
45994_1,President Trump is everything wrong with this country.,He needs to be held at a higher value.,and
45258_3,I became more motivated to advocate it.,I don't want to distance myself from the issue.,and
43826_1,It was upsetting to hear that other very developed countries like England are more globally aware than the US.,I was not surprised by this statement.,Nan
44691_1,"I think our media and our society as a whole, must realize religion does not cause hate.",Hate causes hate.,Nan
44742_1,I really thought it was interesting.,Bassimo said people in England know more about around the world events than Americans.,Nan
43466_4,To get to engage in dialogue with someone.,From a culture that is different from our own. ,so
45141_7," we all different upbringing , we all go through different trials.",Tribulations  that's why we should be more open to the world.,because
43998_2,Just by following the media we shouldn't jump to conclusions.,There may be hidden information.,as
42950_1,There is just too many innocent people facing harsh actions from the United States.,This is something I cannot forgive our military.,for
46008_1,maybe now that the white people that were in the black peoples position have seen and felt just a tiny tiny bit what it is like to be a part of an oppressed group.,They can have some sort of understanding of where that group is coming from when they say something is not right or something needs to be fixed or addressed.,Nan
44354_1,He makes an effort to see the greater good.,I find this so admirable.,Nan
44574_3,"In reality, there are many Afghans like Basim who are kind and generous.",They simply want the world to be a better place.,when
45504_1,Sam did a great job at orchestrating this discussion.,It opened the eyes of many individuals.,because
44703_1,Throughout the entire video I couldnt help but think.,Both groups of people were able to put each other in their shoes.,if
46069_1,It was hard to believe.,Life after slavery was worse for black people then life before slavery.,and
45212_1,This brings up a personal experience.,I was in high school.,when
45851_3,It effects the whole society.,The perspective on people's mind.,and
43254_1,I assumed that he would have said something praising Obama.,That was far from the case.,Nan
45079_5,Others would look at you.,Maybe think that you're not as correct as you think you are.,and
46337_1,I do not believe we are  exposed like we should be to new cultures., jumping into them headfirst can be a great way to people to discover things about themselves.,for
45754_1,This lecture also made me look at myself.,all of these bad things are happening to these innocent people,as
46436_2,"In the winter, it gets very chilly.",You can see almost every star in the sky.,and
43774_1,I thought this interesting. ,Education isn't improving.,and
44777_1,Basim mentioned it was some kind of accident on the military's part.,How can they make mistakes like that in this age of technology.,Nan
44228_1,Groups like the Alt Rigth and Ku Klux Klan call themselves Christians.,They are truly the ones filled with hate.,and
45810_3,The click will wake someone up. ,It will give them the motivation to work towards making our society an equal opportunity society.,and
44336_1,Race is such an abstract term.,It is interchangeable throughout time.,Nan
43543_1,We have to stay strong to what we believe.,We have to be open to listening to what others have to say.,and
46327_2,Sam talked about how the black people ended up going to work for the white people.,That was the only opportunity they really had for work.,because
43000_1,The point you bring up is about the Quran being a helpful tool to an individual to stick to their religion.,It is important that people understand.,so
45946_1,Police brutality needs to be stopped nation wide.,Too many innocent lives are being taken.,as
45086_5,The men had to pretend.,They were a female being called different names to them.,as
44224_1,This specific lecture allowed me to view the world from a different point of view.,I was able to see both sides of every situation.,and
46177_2,Women were forced to wear it to keep themselves modest.,It was a rule that they had to keep themselves covered up.,and
43189_1,Obama era restrictions prohibited strikes against enemy targets too far away from US troops to pose a threat., This basically prevented strikes outside of the war zone.,when
45832_3,These athletes are doing it peacefully.,It shouldn't bother anyone.,so
44555_1,I have preconceived ideas of people and places. ,I should not considering my lack of knowledge about the world. ,Nan
44400_2,Some police officers are quick to judge which is wrong.,I also think calling police officers killing black people a genocide is extremely embellished.,and
46383_2,This discussion the data from Sam gave me better insight.,I feel that I have a better understanding to how my ancestors grew up.,as
46477_4,Sam asked them what they think about each other opinion wise., It was absolutely amazing to hear that neither group judged each other.,and
46211_1,I do agree with you.,To really understand someone's life you need to enter their shoes!,Nan
44998_2,We are biased towards thinking that Christianity does not have the same radical following.,It has been shown in Islam through terrorism in ISIS.,as
43909_1,"If we had gone to war with the Congo for their oil, we'd be just as hateful of those Christian violence than we would be of the current hate against Muslims.",our soldiers would have died by their hand.,because
44868_1,"All I could think was, how can they be so stupid?",How can they be so blind to what is really going on?,and
45078_2,It challenges your own believes.,It challenges your own opinions.,and
45007_1,I do not follow sports much.,I know that players have the ability to make a difference.,and
45024_1,I am an educated college student society member.,There is a responsibility to understand.,as
45897_3,He never saw other people as less than himself.,"Time after time, he heard the students in class say phrases.",Nan

45024_3,There is a responsibility to understand.,It is responsible to understand what is happening in other places.,Nan
44832_1,I believe that we do need to hold police officers to a higher standard.,We also have to understand how stressful and strenuous their jobs are.,as
45861_1,Something that stood out to me particularly was the more knowledge that black people had on the white crimes.,The actual white people.,Nan
45081_2,"By Christians putting themselves in Muslims shoes, people are able to open there minds up to a more complex thinking.","By Muslims putting themselves in Christians shoes, people are able to open their minds up to new opinions.",if
45359_1,"Back in 2001, most people never would have thought they were in danger from foreign enemies.",If they did not join the military.,Nan
43103_1, it took time for him to enter this state,he can say that,Nan
45990_1,More people in this world were willing to forgive others.,Basim does.,if
42960_2,He was able to take facing a horrific experience.,"He came out on top, optimistic.",and
43409_5,Aren't we bad like the terrorists?,We bomb homes of those from Iraq.,if
44117_5,There is value in being morally sound.,In most religions many people fail to accept that.,for
44422_1,"Every year the kindergarten class will get up in front of the entire student body, faculty, and parents.",They perform a native song.,Nan
44327_2,Sam called out people who think they have lots of experience.,They think they are experienced on race.,and
43788_1,"This way, we can empathize.",How would you want the other half of the world to see you?,if
44674_3,I thought that was good to see.,Basim did not look to his religion for answers.,because
45397_5,I believe this happens to just as many whites., it just isnt talked about as often.,Nan
45359_2,If they did not join the military.,9/11 changed that.,Nan
44620_4,In northern regions you see a lot of hockey arenas because it is so cold.,"Back before our modern technology colleges could only go to areas to search for recruits and players, that would end up becoming professionals.",so
45794_3,We begin to feel guilty about who we are.,We use this horrid word again.,and
44665_1,It made me think how just the color of skin can change.,That is how a person is perceived.,so
45403_1,This video of a white man being beaten was hard to watch.,"They beat him bad, they say he acted suspicious, it was hard to watch.",because
44440_2,Eric Garner was selling cigarettes outside a storefront.,The police choked him to death.,for
45182_5,"Trying to play opposite roles, the students took turns trying to talk about their history.","At first, I think they found it hard to get into character.",if
46188_5,He had been murdered by the police.,It shows that this movement is to create a system where EVERYONE is equal.,and
44728_3,Bassim mentioned.,He is not angry at the Americans.,when
43688_3,He should forgive.,He should not hate.,and
45490_4,What steps could we take to reduce police brutality and make up for the failures of the system?,Weeding out those with bias is often hard.,because
46179_1,It is nice to hear.,To understand from women who do wear hijabs that they do it for themselves.,and
44313_2,The whole thing is a huge mess.,It's going to be difficult to find solutions.,and
44087_1,the United States grew bigger,it makes sense why the role of the Presidency has garnered much power.,so
46036_1,"In class this day, I listened.",pondered about how my view of the middle east would change I were to take a trip like the one Mr. Evans took.,if
45069_3,We are still involved over in the Middle East to better the situation over there.,I heard what Basim had said.,because
43883_1,People are American.,American people do not do this often.,as
44940_1, I have never thought of hijabs being sexist.,I remember my senior year of high school reading Persepolis.,as
44076_1,Half the population believes one thing,The other half believes something else.,and
45337_1,I was raised to always stand for the flag no matter what.,It was to give your upmost respect.,and
44022_1,Basim says how his family is no longer living in one place together.,Everyone is separated.,and
44929_1,People who were born the same year(s).,They  have not been afforded the luxury of a peaceful childhood like most of us have had due to this war.,because
46232_1,I talked.,Someone outside of the class strongly believed.,Nan
44936_5,They were asked in class.,Does it get too hot underneath?,as
44624_3,There was a bias that only black people can play ball.,There was a bias that blacks were good at ball.,because
46374_2,We overlook black history.,American history is more important than black history.,and
43364_2,Muslims aren't more violent than Christians.,We are all very similar.,and
44799_1,What if history decided that black people had white slaves?,What if history decided that black people had segregation against white individuals?,and
46516_1,It is ridiculous to think these things.,It is just cultural religious dress.,because
44867_3,They were not privileged.,Everyone was equal.,and
44427_4,This makes them appear dead.,They are ghosts walking in someone's body.,as
43234_4,They are meant to protect this country.,Minorities are part of this country.,as
42936_1,Many Americans are quick to judge the Muslim religion.,They do not know any Muslims personally.,because
45073_3,Who are bad people.,Who spread acts of violence.,and
42791_4,Problems outside of the United States have never been such a constant reminder in our lives. ,It is only natural for us to easily forget. ,because
43832_1,Bassim knows first hand.,The stereotypes put in his people in Iraq.,Nan
43138_1,We may have military family members.,They have served there.,Nan
45480_1,I would have implied that it is quite obvious that it was a negative threat imposed.,The student asked how ISIS posed a threat.,when
43960_1,I'm going to be talking about The Politics of Taking a Knee.,I'm not sure if this was one of the videos.,so
45674_2,They can just make laws to keep it very similar to slavery.,Without it being called slavery.,so
45196_2,Way back in the 1400's mankind was less sophisticated.,Things that they did now days would be considered obscene.,and
45487_4,You could hear the emotion in their voice.,You could see how comfortable they were in their body.,and
44636_1,something is not your culture that you were taught.,That it is wrong,because
46025_1,I think it is hard for these people.,They are involved in this activity.,because
43739_1,I was very puzzled.,At how Bassim was not furious with America.,as
43332_2,No one should ever have to go through such a huge loss in his family.,It was a bombing by the American government that went awry.,because
46257_6,it gave me a real look into what it was like to be a black person today.,I got to see it in a whole new perspective.,because
45374_1,Puerto Rico got hit by two of the largest hurricanes on record.,There's limited coverage of the aftermath.,and
45282_7,The case worker is racially biased a lot of the time.,The case worker believes there is more trouble at home than there actually is.,for
45754_3,all of these bad things are happening to these innocent people,I asked myself why am I going on with my life so selfishly.,as
45386_1,I picked the video of reconstruction.,It put a spotlight on even how slaves were 'freed' from being held captive by whites.,because
44760_2,Some women might have negative views on it.,It's an age thing amongst Muslim women.,if
44221_1,Sam asked us how we would be should a foreign government came to our land.,Sam asked us how we would be should a foreign government destroyed everything in our lives.,if
45281_2,Racism is most evident.,It actually largely .reminds me of some other things,and
45131_1,They may believe that what they're doing is about the right cause.,"Even though that is what they believe, it doesn't mean that the entire group holds that same ideology.",for
44304_2,Its very true that what countries decide to do has a lot of impact on individuals.,They should really think about what they're doing.,as
46425_6,She would only wear her hijab at home.,she lived in Saudi Arabia.,when
45021_1,I can now see black peoples frustration. ,Especially towards this topic. ,when
45203_4,Whites were the last to do it.,It is just unfair.,because
43672_2,"I think had the miserable accident happened to me, I would be furious.",I would go to extreme lengths to ensure the ones who caused the tragedy in my life to be severely punished.,if
45456_1,"I remember seeing a while back, a study was actually done to see how fast false information could be spread on social media.","I can't remember the actual stats, or who conducted it.",and
42900_2,Basim is a real person who along with his son has experienced an utter tragedy.,"His family members were normal, innocent lives that were lost at an avoidable error our country caused.",and
45458_7,"This is very true you must consider crime rates are lower, violent crimes have gone down.","These numbers are lower than they have ever been,  there is all coverage on crime.",when
44704_4,He asked how the pictures made her feel.,"She said, ""You guys are saying the same stuff over and over.""",Nan
44272_3,distant to other nations.,they are always aware of what happens here.,and
43443_1,I was always able to brush it off with the justification.,It just being one small group of crazy people who were extreme.,Nan
45532_4,It's our nation's history.,We should all be aware of it.,because
44293_1,I just think its interesting that.,I just think its interesting that.,Nan
44485_1,That is why we have women studies classes.,There are black history classes.,and
45616_1,Basim  said that  he is able to forgive his enemies.,The reason that he is able to forgive his enemies is  his religion.,because
43558_1,Its also dangerous not to be informed.,Someone can be more gullible when they listen to skewed information being spread across the news media or social media platforms.,because
43757_1,It is true that we immediately judge a person.,We judge their community.,and
45284_1,The racial bias that goes on is obvious.,There are statistics to prove that.,and
42917_1,How many times the police murdered someone of a racial minority may be small.,That number is not telling of the other brutality these cops have inflicted without a gun.,Nan
45070_2,We believe it is necessary for us to be there.,It seems we have done nothing.,and
42876_1,No religion states that they should kill people.,The actions of people should be judged by that person.,and
44272_4,distant to other nations.,they are always aware of what happens here.,and
43025_4,These athletes are protesting peacefully., What is the problem?,so
44810_1,He responded to this question.,It was very eye opening.,Nan
46213_1,Your possibility for employment should be based on your ability to work.,Your possibility for employment should be based on your social skills.,and

45322_1,I loved how calm and welcoming he was.,HE talked to everyone.,when
45488_2,one group said that it was not a show of racism.,it was a a show of pride for their heritage.,and
46278_1,Simple things that I never even thought about are starting to stand out.,Simple things are starting to stand out more to me every day.,and
44847_7,It was awesome to hear what it means to them.,because I did not know prior to this class.,and
45839_1,People can be judgmental.,We must take a step back.,when
45390_2,Employers basically had the power of an owner.,African Americans had to ask permission from these employers to even leave these jobs.,as
44954_3,"This person essentially said, indifferently, it is your country.",You should care about it.,so
43652_2,"However, you cannot truly understand until you travel.","However, you cannot truly understand until you expand your vision.",and
44309_1,"However, many times these statements.",On efforts regarding militia.,Nan
45011_4,We've been seeing many instances where police brutality has become really bad.,Police are killing black people.,and
45394_6,Black people talked like modern day white people.,Their statements epitomized what uneducated white people sound like.,if
43666_1,We have been told in Soc 119 the kindness of Muslims to everyone in their homes.,We have never seen this side from our media coverage of the Middle East.,for
45412_5,Everyone nowadays is scared getting pulled over by a cop.,Cops' reputations scare people.,because
46077_3,Many Black people at this time were uneducated.,Very few would be able to vote.,so
43663_3,We make ourselves feel better by saying they really aren't Christians.,Christians  would never kill.,and
43166_4,The media portrays many more unarmed black deaths by police.,Blacks push for their stories to be heard.,so
44798_2,:iving in the shoes black people did during those times is humbling.,"It's completely startling, knowing that situations could have easily been flipped had history been opposite.",and
45194_1,I know my objective history.,This class was interesting and enticing.,so
44685_2,You said that it does not define us.,I could not agree more about that.,and
46246_1,I really respected the fact.,"These girls wear their hijabs for many different reasons,",Nan
43495_1,I remember taking field trips to the places that they used to live.,I remember learning about their ways of life.,and
44025_1,Basim is the epitome of your typical Iraq man.,He is just trying to live out his life.,Nan
44809_3,They are extremely devout to their religion.,I can  respect that.,and
45227_3,It is our responsibility to find out what is happening out there on our own.,It is our responsibility to develop our own stances.,and
46194_2,"In some countries, it is required to wear even a full burka in public.",I feel like that type of imposed regulation suffocates a womans true ability to express herself. ,Nan
44060_2,To have empathy you have to put yourself in someone else's shoes.,To have empathy you have to deeply try to feel what they're going through.,and
44848_1,The girls put hijabs on students who don’t usually wear them. ,How they felt really surprised me. ,and
46264_2,We should be more knowledgeable of what actually happens.,we could report true news.,and
44763_3,She realizes that she'll be critically judged by others.,She shows much of her skin.,and
43386_4,Black people are still projected to earn much lower amounts of money than white people.,Black people experience less steep financial growth.,and
44712_2,He did not blame anyone for this.,He blamed the American government. ,and
46229_6, its unfair that its required to wear them .,Its something I have thought about myself.,and
46022_1,I believe the media focuses on this issue more.,The media focuses on the issue more than natural disasters.,so
43953_1,I am from Colombia.,I have lost count of how many times American people have spelled it Columbia.,and
43549_1,I have always been interested on what is going on the world.,It is something I have always been interested in.,and
44008_1,Brena said.,We see more black people getting shot.,and
46327_3,That was the only opportunity they really had for work.,The laws that were created to keep them at the bottom.,and
46440_1,Mark Evan's trip was outstanding.,the fact that someone would cross a desert is unbelievable.,as
45821_3,They took pride in their beliefs.,It is something to be admired.,and
43833_1,Through his massive grief he is able to go on with his life.,He is able to talk to men and women from the country that destroyed his family.,Nan
45414_3,Most people here are Christians.,It is easier to hate.,and
45519_3,Everyone heard his story.,Our world would be able to progress towards better relations.,and
45744_3,His next picture is a group of wealthy black business men from 1859.,They were rich from benefits of the slave trade.,Nan
44738_2,I don't know why you can't just get over it.,Really shows the magnitude of many white Americans ignorance for this historically racist topic.,Nan
43389_1,Donald Trump has been tweeting about it.,Donald Trump has in some way influenced this.,and
42933_1,This is shown during Basim speaking.,How his religion says that you should forgive others.,when
43796_1, Sam showed the stats of white vs. black.,Sam showed who gets killed more.,and
45731_1,I don't know if I could ever forgive a country and people.,Who accidentally hurt my family in the pursuit of violence.,Nan
42880_1,It is key to educate at a young age., in the long run one person can benefit and affect thousands.,because
43210_1,that is why the black and brown players are taking a knee.,it is not just because the politics of the system are unfair.,Nan
44735_7,They were eventually taking the native land in the Americas.,they thought they were the first to discover the land.,because
46160_2,We ourselves define who we are not what we wear.,"It was our personality, traits, characteristics, or even actions.",Nan
45849_4,I began to think about the image of God a s a black person.,I imaged the Mona Lisa as a black woman.,as
44292_4,They think we made everything much better.,I think we have made an impact to an extent.,so
43794_4,Why is printing on plates not considered disrespectful?,Why is wearing it on clothing not in the the same category?,and
45374_4,There's limited coverage of the aftermath.,There's little being done to actually help the citizens.,and
44468_2,He was alright speaking to us.,He does not have ill will towards the American people.,and
43522_1,"I couldnt believe that included in that same passage were fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, sodomites, thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers, extortioners.",most of everyone have engaged in at least one of these acts.,as

43511_1,He never truly tells ,He never truly tells ,for
43196_1,I didn’t find any of them to be surprising.,I was already well aware of this discussion along with the numbers.,because
44388_1,Basim is just one story.,Imagine all the Basims that have happened over the years because of the US military.,as
43172_1,I agree with,you talked about the idea of using the Bible to resolve controversial topics like discrimination and abortion,when

44192_5,We cannot pick one.,We cannot force it upon people.,and
43805_3,Football is one of the most popular viewing spectacles in the United States.,That is exactly what it has done.,and

45724_1,I'm not too sure why.,The history really is different to me.,Nan
45486_1,It was interesting.,All the volunteers were regurgitating things that they have said.,because

43910_2,This is the main reason.,It isn't talked about more.,Nan
44114_1,How are we supposed to be involved?,How are we supposed to be aware of what is happening around the world?,and
43924_2,It is important that i think more about point of view., The different situations can be viewed differently.,for
45081_4,"By Muslims putting themselves in Christians shoes, people are able to open their minds up to new opinions.","By Muslims putting themselves in Christians shoes, than people are able to open there minds up to a more complex thinking.",and

46105_3,I never really had to face racial discrimination before.,I was unable to fully  comprehend a situation like this.,so
45652_3,It will begin to further address these perceptions.,It will address race issues.,and
43912_1,I honestly couldnt think of one question to ask him.,I was absolutely speechless.,because
44647_4,The statistics prove that black people have been placed in an unfair position.,Black people are persecuted.,and
45421_1,Say we reverse history.,it is the white people who feel oppressed,and
43179_2,I have lived in Abu Dhabi. ,I completely agree with what Bassim has to say. ,and

44340_2,Different media sources can choose to publish some articles concerning war.,Different media sources can restrain others.,if
44151_2,We change leaders. ,"When we do, there is much talk of improvement and how things will get better",when

46391_1,Racism was a major issue this country faced.,Racism is a major issue this country faces.,and
43076_1,Many governments are corrupt. ,The people who suffer it are the citizens. ,and
44824_1,I did learn more about the war in class.,I was stunned at the amount  of damage done in Mosul.,Nan
46137_3,"We took away any rights, banned them from our schools, stores, even having the ability to acquire property.",We took away any rights to own money.,for
45845_1,"Coming from a small town, I was not exposed to violence, different races, a lot of the things people have gone through.","To listen to others, what they have to say, learning new cultures, I have made myself more aware to having empathy.",so
45803_2,He stated Americans say KKK members aren't real Christians.,Don't say the same thing about ISIS members not being real Muslims.,Nan
45935_1,It helped me understand.,There is a system.,Nan
46062_2,The media does tend to try to exaggerate some aspects.,The media really trigger emotions using pathos.,and
44688_1,A man who commits a vicious crime may happen to have a religious preference.,This does not mean the vicious crime is caused by the religious preference.,because
44303_2,I would barely be able to control myself.,I would barely be able to control my anger.,and
42885_1,People listen to the news to get factual information.,That is not what is happening.,and
46025_3,They are involved in this activity.,It is hard to actually put themselves into the other race's shoes.,Nan
42842_2,I heard what Bassim had to say to the class.,I felt a part of me wanting to show more empathy,and
44373_2,They have done nothing to improve upon the situations,They promise to repair.,as
43953_3,I have lost count of how many times American professors have spelled it Columbia.,I have lost count of how many times Americans have asked me if my family is part of the mafia.,and
44672_1,It made sense to me that he would forgive Americans.,Most of us could not control what the government does.,because
45913_3,how do we stop having these thoughts  they arent dispelled by the people who have lived?,People can answer them first hand.,and
42806_3,It is awful.,There are corrupt police officers who harm a person of color.,when
44274_1,Like many I don't like being ignorant to what happens to other countries.,I will often put in the extra effort to learn.,and
44950_4,Bush served in office.,Obama served in office.,as
44735_6,They captured slaves who propelled the Africans' development.,They were eventually taking the native land in the Americas.,because
44245_1,I'm Roman Catholic.,Forgiveness is promoted in every mass.,and
45560_1,White adolescents are well privileged.,White adolescents are well educated.,and
45378_4,We take care of our own people.,Not doing so is also a form of disrespect.,and
44222_1,At this exact moment I had a completely different perspective toward everything.,At this exact moment I had a completely different perspective toward what is currently going on.,Nan
44951_3,Imagine if we told this to the divided United States of America.,We seem to have fought a civil war over the 2016 presidential election.,Nan
45770_3,It was justified.,It was one of the greatest things to happen.,and
42911_1,As a generation we have a duty to stop generalizing a people. ,We can live in peace.,so
43532_2,It's very hard to not listen to the media.,You believe it or not.,Nan
46501_2,There are grave sites where people are building infrastructures on.,That would be the most disrespectful thing to their ancestors who lost their lives.,and
44196_1,I think it was important for Sam to introduce Bassim.,The way he described him as a friend.,so
43249_3,Atrocities committed by Christians are often overlooked.,The target is them currently is Muslims.,because
43141_1,This guy killed his own people.,He used numerious methods. ,Nan
45431_5,"They approached it casually, like a Penn State student would.",They explained why they wear blue and white to a football game.,and
45770_5,How is it so different?,Blacks fought for their freedom?,when
44117_3,There is value in being morally sound.,In most religions many people fail to accept that.,and
44117_4,There is value in being morally sound.,In most religions many people fail to accept that.,and
45812_1,If we stay in this rut we will be pointlessly killing,If we stay in this rut we will be pointlessly discriminating for no other reason than racism,and
42782_2,Imagine I was at his position.,my family have literally been taken away from me over a matter of a few seconds.,and
43612_1,I do think it is possible to escape the media from controlling what we believe.,We just need to put in the effort to do so.,if
43697_1,In life we are able to explore other religions.,We decide ourselves what we choose.,for
45838_1,Empathy is a trait everyone needs to be aware of.,They need to try to have it.,and
43020_2,People here talk about Muslims killing Muslims.,People will never say Christians are killing Christians.,Nan
44162_2,Issues are happening in society.,That means looking up information themselves.,and
42816_3,Listening to Basim allowed me to understand Afghanistan better.,I was able to humanize Afghanistan more.,Nan
42823_1,I rewatched this part of the class on the SOC 119 website.,I thought about how Muslims in Iraq may be looking at Christians.,when
46282_9,You cannot use them they are not a backbone of beliefs.,"We all can see, it is easy to skew numbers in someones favor.",for
44101_2,I started the semester with a closed mind,I observed the political and racial world around me,Nan
46434_1,It definitely seemed like what they said started out as a joke.,You could see.,because
45714_1,At first I thought I was going to be one of those classes that was going to cause a heated debate.,That's not really how it went.,Nan
45948_3,It allowed people to open up more.,It allowed more honest past mindsets to shine through.,for
45618_4,That will only cause more tragedies happen.,To forgive his enemies there is no other way that will benefit not only him,so
42977_1,Sam discusses islamophobia.,Sam discusses all this talk about Muslims killing each other.,and
44415_2,I do not share the same ideals as white supremacists in the South.,I shouldnt categorize any Muslim as part of the Taliban.,so
44548_3,His experience with the foster homes was sad.,His culture had to mix with non-native American culture in terms of his hair getting cut.,because
44611_1,I was curious.,Bassims people might have more of an appeal to Obama.,if
45039_1,Many people have a narrow minded view of how the world is today.,This is due to the environments those people live in.,and
43733_4,Many different people could have different views.,Sharia Law should be enforced and conducted.,Nan
45003_3,The players kneeled during the national anthem.,He did not use that disgust on neo-nazis.,and
46327_4,That was the only opportunity they really had for work.,The laws that were created to keep them at the bottom.,because
43727_2,It does not make the action better.,It is easier to forgive.,Nan
44103_5,I think its crazy he he tries hard to reach the issues from many different angles.,His lecture covers almost covers every single angle.,so
43943_1,The amount of courage and strength a person has to have in order to forgive someone whos wronged them is already really high.,I cannot tell you how much respect I have for Basim.,and
43126_2,They don't stand for the national anthem.,"In actuality, this is completely legal.",Nan
45140_3,To find opportunity.,To find shelter. ,and
45336_1,The way I was grown up was with many military stores.,They were from my father.,Nan
45912_1,I am curious what Sam would have asked the girls.,He was asking questions.,if
44260_1,It has really opened my eyes.,It made me realize.,and
44802_1,Flip flopping roles and giving an insight to both sides opens the eyes of everyone.,People see how their own role varies and affects the other side.,as
46125_1,Everyone has their own distinct style.,When looking at a Muslim woman wearing a hijab.,Nan
45042_1,I think this was a very good idea  Sam to flip the history of white people.,I think this was a very good idea  Sam to flip the history of black people.,and
46116_2,Sam took us deeper.,He explained in his unique way the way things occurred.,Nan
43812_3,We generalize Christians to be innocent.,We generalize Christians to be holy.,so
42859_1,We should all consider his message a sign.,we need to further educate ourselves.,and
43176_5,Imagine a group of people decided to interpret the meanings.,Say they spread out the thoughts.,if
45777_2,We continue to preach the land of freedom.,"With our fear to face our history, we will not grow.",and
43957_3,There is so much more going on than what we might see covered.,it is only up to us to find those stories.,and
45954_1,I could feel them not feeling fully comfortable.,They were not making more than a general point.,and
44951_1,Everyone will come in and promise it.,Nothing has changed since 2003.,Nan
45047_7,Videos were not seen.,There was an in class demonstration.,and
42818_1,Our school system should definitely be educating our youth more on people outside of our country.,There are real people and families out there.,Nan
46133_2,I do not believe that they have the right to tell me what I can do with my body.,I respect that they appreciate  their religion and government enough to follow these ideals.,because
44711_3,I thought he would be blaming all Americans for the loss of his relatives.,He did none of this.,and
45862_3,They could explain why the white people had historically thought of these crimes as okay.,They could justify why the white people had historically thought of these crimes as okay.,and
44013_3,He starts talking about ISIS.,They came to Mosul.,when
46326_1,White people today are similar they seem to have majority control.,"They seem to have control over wealth, stuff, they do not want to give up to black people.",and
44158_3,I think political people just put on a show. ,They claim to know what to do. ,and
44841_2,A loss of a life is a loss of a life.,We have to have faith in the judicial system.,and
43754_1,All of his lectures have forced me to look at issues in a new way.,This is what makes me learn much from this class.,so
43224_1,We are usually only shown a certain thing.,A certain thing is shown to us in great detail.,Nan
44076_3,The other half believes something else.,One side is going to be unhappy with the result.,and
44822_3,He could learn not to be judgmental.,So can everyone else.,and
46254_1,"In my opinion,  faith is what really bring people together","I hope more people in Iran can be like Basim, holding their faith .",and
44257_2,Be more aware of what's going on in this world.,It's really important.,Nan
46507_1,I  selected this video.,it really was a meaningful experience to both the people who participated in the activity.,because
42820_3,It baffles me to watch the news.,It baffles me to watch the news on white supremacists.,Nan
45503_1,"It is our job to go the extra mile,",It is our job to become educated on whats going on around us through other sources.,and
44074_2,Then it is one person's  or a group of people's interpretations that determines what happens to someone.,It does not use facts.,and
42798_2,His friend was unable to return to Mosul. ,It was not because of his intense fear of Isis.,Nan
45257_6,We can make people become better.,It is due to this class.,for
43141_2,He used numerious methods. ,He shot them. ,Nan
44623_2,There is a myth that black people are better at basketball.,Naturally it doesn't even make sense.,because
44930_4,It leads to unprovoked violence.,Our country has already done enough damage.,because
44532_1,We must try to understand each other..,We must try to accept each other for our differences.,Nan
42928_4,I had an open mind.,"but I understand religion much more from meeting, speaking, and asking questions to Muslims that I have met from leaving my home town and going to college.",so
43854_4,Why not band together?,"Why not do something more meaningful off of the field (such as starting charities, donating, being politically active or lobbying)?",and
45519_2,Basim is truly an inspiration.,Everyone heard his story.,if
45850_1,I learned that history matters a lot.,I learned the person's perspective on people matters a lot.,and
43745_1,I used to naively care about my country., I realized about all the cultural differences.,and
43702_1,He mentioned how corruption is a major problem in Iraq.,Every new president has promised to fix it.,Nan
45974_1,"Imagine they wanted to travel to somewhere,",They had to get a permission from a farm owner.,when
44645_3,I am definitely someone who has said that the past is in the past and that black people are progressively getting more equality.,That statement should not be said because I know that their history goes back to slavery.,because
43118_3,social media and news are posting terrible events that had done by the ISIS.,majority of those people are not Muslim.,when
45600_1,"With today's issues surrounding the criminal justice system, white people are ignorant.",They were this way during the Civil Rights movement.,as
46091_6,It was hurting me more than it was benefiting me.,"With more deep though, I realized it is a lot easier to forgive than have hate.",and
44323_4,Not everyone is lucky.,It comes to outcomes of war.,when
44289_4,These people have struggled enough.,These people deserve a better quality of life.,and
43352_1,She articulated that the forgiveness gave her the most amazing feeling.,it meant she had power and control over her life.,because
44181_2,Many people are innocent like Basim.,Basim's family was innocent.,and
42975_7,He can just decide one week what he wants to bring up in class.,that means there was possibly something that made him think of it.,if
44618_1,I completely agree with Sam.,He says about race in sports.,Nan
43170_2,The fact that you are tired of seeing them killed.,Seeing them attacked at all.,and
44263_2,They control what we see of other countries.,It is important that we look into the issues ourselves.,as
45800_1,Say this were to happen the other way around.,all Muslims probably would think that all Americans act as KKK members,if
43628_3,The world I saw was from classes and TV.,Those are definitely not what the real world is like.,so
44821_2,We should not put everyone in a certain group., one persons actions.,and
43341_1,"Even if all the infrastructure is replaced, the lives could never be replaced. ",fThe amilies could never be replaced.,and
45967_1,The world would improve dramatically.,It would inspire people to become better.,and
43405_2,This confirmed my belief.,We Americans are always very quick to point fingers at others.,so
44930_1,More intervention is unnecessary.,It leads to unprovoked violence.,for
44243_3,"Love others, letting go of any hate you harbor inside.","How Bassim has the ability to do that, he has my utmost respect.",and
44883_1,Blacks worked harder.,They reach social ceilings built by discrimination that impede their growth.,and
45516_1,Many Americans have stereotyped all Muslims as terrorists.,Due to the very small percent that are terrorists.,because
43678_1,One reason is that he was in the United States.,"He saw the people were friendly, harmless.",and
43102_1,Bassim has lost friends and family because of the US.,he can genuinely say he holds no anger for this country and to its citizens.,for
43382_5,"It is tragic, the extent of people who have to experience it.","I think it needs to change, 100%.",so
45504_2,It opened the eyes of many individuals.,Individuals that don't think there is a difference in the way blacks are treated.,and
45268_2,Beliefs will always cause people to fight. ,They will fight people in and outside of their religion. ,and
43210_2,it is not just because the politics of the system are unfair.,It's because they're dangerous.,Nan
43209_4,Were going to keep having it.,Till we can talk about it.,and
45025_2,Ideas discussed in a class about race are inclined to vary each semester.,Ideas discussed in a class about ethnic relations are inclined to vary each semester.,and
46096_1,I'm like Basso.,I gain strength.,Nan
44811_1,"At first, he was filled with anger and rage.",Over time he forgave.,and
44212_6,These are Aermicans.,This is our government.,because
44119_4,Tere is not one right religion.,and one is not superior to another.,Nan
45418_2,I wish I had his willpower and strength because family is my life.,Just one person in my family died from something so tragic I would not be able to cope for the longest time.,if
43176_3,Imagine a group of people decided to interpret the meanings.,Say they spread out the thoughts.,and
44878_1,This shows only a sliver.,Slave traders thought that Africans' lives were meaningless.,Nan
43691_2,It's important people understand that that is not true.,It is only a small percentage.,for
45966_3,"get other races to believe , to  join us.",That would really be something special.,and
45290_1,I've never thought to try.,To put myself in someone else's shoes in that way before.,and
45227_4,It is our responsibility to develop our own stances.,It is our responsibility to not take those that are being laid out in front of us.,and
46037_4,My family has endured.,My family lost so much through out the war currently happening on the part of the world.,because
45450_4,It makes sense.,The people in Afghanistan wouldn't see a change.,Nan
46176_2,The final message was delivered. ,"The was Sam spoke about instead of women being oppressed they're elevated, truly empowered me. ",Nan
45414_2,It is particularly a difficult situation in the USA.,Most people here are Christians.,because
44342_1,One question sticks out to me.,How are you not angry?,Nan
45625_1,I feel like a lot of the divide our nation has over racism is purely due to ignorance.,It is not out of malice.,so
44738_1,The African American students make comments about slavery such as it was a long time ago.,I don't know why you can't just get over it.,Nan
45957_2,I think white people were better able to picture what it might be like.,Their ancestors went through these awful things.,because
43792_1,I find that the media plays a huge role in how the citizens of most Muslim citizens are portrayed.,the media do not show the entire story.,as
43959_4,I think is crucial to learn about cultures of countries unlike your own.,I think is crucial to learn about practices of countries unlike your own.,and
45844_2,I have not gone through a lot.,I do not understand.,because
45844_1,I have tried to understand other people's feelings more.,I have not gone through a lot.,because
45271_1,The whole lecture was about a class on empathy.,I think it made a lot of people think about their religion.,Nan
43157_1,Bottom line is that Christianity is a beautiful religion.,Islam is a beautiful religion.,and
43924_3,It is important that i think more about point of view., The different situations can be viewed differently.,so
44630_3,I never felt very religious by their definition.,My mom apologized for forcing me to do something.,Nan
45561_5,The girls were shocked.,The statistics came back.,when
45062_2,People had no immunity to the diseases.,The diseases nearly wiped them all out.,Nan
42979_2,It's spent its whole life in the water.,Water is all the fish knows.,and
44663_3,He flipped all the statistics around.,It made it seem like history had been this way.,as
45955_2,I think they felt strange acting the pain of centuries of oppression.,They have never felt it.,if
43300_1,The law changed.,This doesn't mean that civil society accepted this movement.,because
43840_1,See the world through the eyes of somebody else.,You see the world through a different way.,Nan
44489_1,If I was him I would have so much built up anger.,I would not be able to handle him.,Nan
42908_5,They caused a lot of pain.,They claimed it was in the name of Islam.,for
46347_8,This hatred happens to good people.,"who worked hard, and yet were not accepted the same freedom because of their skin.",and
45397_3,Some police may be racist against blacks.,Some people target them.,and
45073_2,That there are people of the Christian religion.,Who are bad people.,and
44426_1,This is the first time Ive ever heard of the Native American boarding schools.,The injustices boarding schools brought to the native people.,and
44128_1,One of my favorite parts about this class has been being able to see a certain group of people who are often categorized as negative.,One of my favorite parts about this class has been being able to see a certain group of people in a whole new light.,Nan
44795_3,Sam described the treatment of the whites was mind boggling.,It was seeing another side of the story,and
44936_4,They were asked in class.,Does it get too hot underneath?,and
44142_3,Don’t state you believe NFL players shouldn’t take a knee. ,Propose a solution for the protest. ,and
44179_2,A foreign government came your land.,A foreign government killed your loved ones.,if
43812_1,We generalize Christians to be innocent.,We generalize Christians to be holy.,and
42900_1,Americans have to realize these are real humans.,Basim is a real person who along with his son has experienced an utter tragedy.,Nan
43606_2, it is important that we take advantage of these opportunities in order to understand other people and cultures.,we should rid ourselves of any misconceptions that we may have.,and
44657_3,It's okay to to dress how you dress.,It's okay to practice what you would like.,and
45692_3,That can help inflict change. ,These tensions can grow. ,because
45394_1,It was funny to hear the different sides.,Black people talked like modern day white people.,as
46205_1,Protestors want to bring this to society's attention. ,Protesters want other people to realize.,and
44454_1,"From what I know, men have placed this attire on women to be a symbol of modesty.","From what I know, men have placed this attire on women to be a symbol of privacy.",as
46362_7,A white student respond.,"you have this power ,privilege that you don't see this racism.",because
42828_1,I can't seem to wrap my head.,Around the way that we humans think. ,Nan
42817_4,He made great American friends.,Americans were the ones who bombed his home on accident.,so
45882_3,I found this activity interesting.,It took our preconceived notions about race.,so
44764_5,It made them more comfortable.,They feel less under the judgmental eyes of people.,and
46504_1,We are doing an awful job of owning up to our history. ,Maybe thats why the saying history repeats itself is so relevant.,and
44745_1,You want to learn more about an event or tragedy.,You can look up anything online.,Nan
44227_1,A majority of us have grouped 1 billion people into a category.,That emphasizes evilness.,when
46374_4,American history is more important than black history.,Black history didn't directly affect white people.,as
43762_2,"Like you, I am amazed on the power Basim has to forgive.",He realizes there is good in the world.,as
44563_2,I am sure.,it would have the same positive impact as in the class.,Nan
43983_2,I believe it is our duty to be informed., I have been thinking about a lot in this class is whose responsibility is it to educate the public on social issues.,and
46338_2,Overall this lecture was very eye opening.,There are opportunities that I did not know existed.,and
44543_1,I had no idea about the boarding schools.,Boarding schools had an impact on the Native American culture.,and
43350_1,One thing that struck me about him was the similarity between him and a woman who had survived the Holocaust.,I watched a video on her recently.,Nan
46257_3,it gave me a real look into what it was like to be a black person during those times.,it gave me a real look into what it was like to be a black person today.,because
43243_3,"Like I said, women are oppressed everywhere.",It's not just Muslim women.,and
44050_1,People all over the country reacted differently to this peaceful protest.,What does our nation stands for?,Nan
44033_5,It is an act that can be easily brushed under the rug.,The bomb only hit two homes.,because
43582_1,I find that interesting.,It shows about how many unknown events there are going on.,because
42997_1,We are told to take Gen Eds.,They will give us a well-rounded view of many areas of life.,because
44664_1,I caught myself multiple times.,I was feeling upset about how the black people had treated the white people throughout history.,Nan
46037_7,I believe i was able to grasp a better understanding and feeling for the actions happening in the middle east., I would be capable of changing the negative way I see the middle east.,if
44664_3,I always ended up remembering that the roles were reversed.,This didn't actually happen to people whose skin looked like mine.,and
44066_1,I agree with you.,That technology has opened many doors for the world.,so
43722_4,It shows a lot of strength.,I think everyone could benefit from acting the same way.,because
44322_2,Some battles occur within their own towns.,Some battles occur within their own cities.,and
46174_4,It gives you a perspective to see the world with less concern and less fear.,"When she said those words, for a couple of seconds Sam turned to me and we both shook our heads nodding approvingly.",Nan
42949_1,It is hard to take in that my own government has destroyed  many lives.,They try to protect their own citizens.,so
46003_3,We automatically shift blame towards the President.,It is easy to blame the President.,because
45721_1,"It made me laugh, white people say the same thing on this topic.",White's will tell you the same thing about this topic.,Nan
46129_1,We got their opinion on our clothing.,We got their opinion on what they think of us.,and
43251_4,The way we achieve these feelings is important. ,because using us vs them creates groups that are targeted for unfair reasons.,Nan
43745_2,I used to naively care about my country., I realized about all the cultural differences.,as
44620_2,You don't see a lot of other sports.,In northern regions you see a lot of hockey arenas because it is so cold.,and
45809_2,It is taking a minute.,It is thinking what it is like in the shoes of the people you are judging.,and
44622_1,There are racist to under tones to how these payer were selected.,That's a different story.,for
44375_1,Obama did not end the war.,Trump does not make it seem like he is planning on changing that anytime soon.,and
45770_4,It was one of the greatest things to happen.,How is it so different?,when
45010_1,I've always believed the media can cause us to believe issues that simply aren't accurate.,The media can cause us to side with issues that simply aren't accurate.,and

43770_4,There is corruption in,There is corruption in the governmen.,for

44450_5,We continue to turn a blind eye.,Who are we to say we are better than the people bombing towns?,because

45198_4,We know much more than the common person did in the 1400's.,We know more about the world.,because
43286_2,My dad went to school in Poland.,My dad knows everything about its history.,and
45871_2,"Health, which indicated that black people statistically sold more drugs than white people.",the fact that more white people were jailed in the United States was really alarming to me.,and

43229_4,Targeting minorities.,and women.,Nan
45526_3,I stand for our flag. ,I believe I am given freedom because of those who served our country. ,for

43841_2,Go learn.,Go live.,Nan
44796_2,It was terribly harsh treatment of people.,We learned about it in school.,and
43635_3,I wish I had learned this earlier. ,I would have a more worldly perspective.,when
42947_1,I think it is very hard to wrap my mind about the bombings.,it literally destroyed an environment.,and
43508_2,Anything is possible.,These days it is really important to remember this.,and
44735_1,I thought the beginning of the exercise was powerful.,Sam began talking about how Africans simply used their resources/wit to travel up through Europe.,and
45613_2,I will not have the ability to forgive those who hurt my family.,I will not have the ability to forgive those who destroy my home.,and
44010_1,About half of 1% in a million black people who were killed by the police were unarmed,This does not seem like a high number at all at least not compared to what the media portrays.,Nan
44800_3,You cannot understand a situation should you not be in a person's shoes.,I think this really did give everyone a taste of a flip flopped history book.,as

44647_1,I was not in sociology on the day this lecture happened.,I would have never known the alarming statistics.,for
45026_1,I admire Sam for the way he runs Soc119.,He simply allows himself to be human.,because
46258_2,I did notice something interesting during this activity.,I did notice something interesting in class.,Nan
45237_1,An NFL game is the perfect place.,Millions of Americans watch professional football.,because
44866_3,"I never thought about my life, being a straight white female being a privilege.",Listening in on this lesson I felt arrogant.,as

44925_1,One of the biggest things have stuck out to me is how similar we are to people from Syria.,We are quick to judge of many stereotypes.,so
45644_1,I thought the one white guy made some very interesting points.,I enjoyed watching him.,and
43383_1,"Hopefully, well soon be able to fix this problem.",well soon be able to make the world a safer place for everyone.,and
43852_1,Doing during the anthem is a backhanded way to make their protest seem more important.,This is normally a time of great reverence and respect.,because
44701_2,The sitting black man said that history is history.,History should not be a white studies class.,Nan
43222_2,I agree with your sentiment.,Americans are more interested in things that directly affect them.,Nan
43418_2,Sitting will not help solve anything.,Waiting will not help solve anything.,and
43340_1,The war will eventually end.,"Hopefully, ISIS will eventually leave.",and
45016_2,There is ignorance when white people talk about slavery.,There is ignorance about how defensive they can be.,and
45258_4,I became more motivated to advocate it.,I don't want to distance myself from the issue.,for
44562_2,All he wanted was his family.,Both were taken from him.,and
45794_1,Let us be warned.,We begin to feel guilty about who we are.,and
45430_1,"Being rarely exposed to these women, I feel as though Americans could quickly generalize that they are highly religious and removed from their society.",Americans could never think that they would be open to a conversation about the meaning behind their hijabs.,and
43561_3,It shows that our country needs to step up our education.,"As a general society, we need to be more empathetic to world tragedies.",and
46366_2,it's not you guys on the screen.,a white student responds by saying that the system is still rigged and were still enslaved today.,Nan
45950_2,A white kid probably never would have felt comfortable saying something.,They  were property.,Nan
43905_1,The media is a factor.,It influences stupid people easily.,because

45135_5,The tension will lead to animosity between them.,has led to animosity between them.,and
44099_3,"More frequently than not, we go in.",We make the situation worse than it was in the first place.,and

45791_3,Anyone reported to have any privilege were starved.,Anyone reported to have any privilege were tortured.,Nan
44602_1,Sports players protesting through the National Anthem each week is very interesting to see.,It is on the biggest stage.,because

44265_1,I agree with what you said.,The American people have not been exposed to the majority of Muslim people.,Nan
45844_3,I have not gone through a lot.,I do not understand.,so

43251_1,I do not think that patriotism is a bad thing. ,I do not think that nationalism is a bad thing. ,and
45816_1,By taking this class for just a few short weeks.,I have already begun to think about people differently.,and
44008_4,We see more black people getting abused against on the internet and media.,We easily assume.,Nan
45133_1,The people who practice the religion as a whole most likely do not support the actions of those who break the rules of the religion.,They think they are making a statement.,because
45453_1,I personally think its crazy that people base their opinions off of swayed news channels.,"They base their opinions on what they see on social media, especially our generation.",and
45246_1,I told my mom one of my friends was going to Israel in the summer.,It was an internship.,for
42944_5, it gives me a great deal of insight on how blessed I am to never have experienced something  terrible,it  changes my perspective on what our military is doing to these innocent people.,so
43591_5,Basim is forgiving. ,The unimaginable happened to Basim.,because
43475_2,you wondered why most of the class wrong.,you assumed we thought Basim would be angry,and
43685_1,This ties into the current state of America very well.,They are angry at different people.,so
43357_2,Every news outlet puts its own spin on a certain issue. ,In the process it loses meaning of the story. ,and
45141_2,I agree that we have to be able to have empathy to one another.," we all different upbringing , we all go through different trials.",as
43949_1,I found it really interesting and spot on how true it is what Sam said about teachers., that teachers do not have to be teachers in profession because of a degree.,Nan
43336_2,Say we do it.,Apparently our leaders don't always do as they've promised,if
43067_2,We should all strive to understand those around us.,It's not much at all.,if
46292_1,Another thing that really resonated with me was how several of the non-hijab wearing women said that they felt more safe.,he non-hijab wearing women said that they felt more relaxed.,Nan
43086_2,I have not been taught to care about their history.,I have not been taught to care about their current events. ,and
43302_1,One can argue that everyone is equal.,"In terms of economic equality, this is simply not true.",Nan
44270_1,We are taught to forgive and love everyone.,It is unfair that we treat a specific group that way.,and
45948_7,It allowed more honest past mindsets to shine through.,It allowed more honest current mindsets to shine through.,for
45935_3,Most people don't think about it.,Most people don't believe it.,because
42823_4,They might think we are all bad.,They have heard of the bad people who have participated in crimes in the name of Christianity.,because
43279_5,I feel like it isn't talked about as it deserves to be.,It was the start to racial division in the United States of America.,because
45809_1,There is a first step in getting past these stereotypes.,It is taking a minute.,Nan
46478_3,They respect it. ,They could see how it would be cool to be on the other side as well. ,and

42784_3,He understood.,He shouldn't blame all American for what had happened to his family.,Nan
44950_5,Obama served in office.,Trump have served in office.,and
43745_4, I realized about all the cultural differences.,I became more aware about other nations.,and
45920_2,That people from the outside have different beliefs.,We tend to believe.,and
42996_3,I definitely recommend everyone to take COMM 205.,These classes are not highly recommended by the school.,Nan

44652_2,They are raised in all settings.,They are raised in all cultures.,and
45825_1,This particular lesson really made me appreciate my place here at Penn State.,we are surrounded by so much diversity and opportunity.,because
43764_2,The attacks on September 11 were malicious.,They sought to harm people.,and
43245_2,We need to extend it to all women,we cannot just target Muslim woman and pretend like were somehow fixing it,Nan
46194_3,I feel like that type of imposed regulation suffocates a womans true ability to express herself. ,I feel like that type of imposed regulation suffocates a woman  right to express herself in any way she deems fit.,and
46040_5,These are inaccurate stereotypes.,These are negative stereotypes.,and
44158_2,This question is hard to answer. ,I think political people just put on a show. ,so
46490_1,People don't realize that their skin color adds stipulation to their lives.,Ignorance exists in this world.,because
43004_1,"If you want to be a good person, be a good person.",live your life by the suggestions in the Quran or the Bible or the Torah or whatever holy book your religion follows.,and
44721_2,You are right.,We need to be more aware of what is happening around the world.,and
44144_3,Whether Steph wants to go to the White House for recognition.,It's really not as if Steph could voice his opinions on the racial injustice while being recognized for winning the NBA Finals!,and

42993_1,"In that case, I believe they must utilize the resources.",They do have to inform themselves about their world.,Nan

46181_1,There are people who think of wearing it.,People think wearing it feeds into sexism.,Nan
45079_4,You look at yourself.,Others would look at you.,as
46292_2,he non-hijab wearing women said that they felt more relaxed.,he non-hijab wearing women said that they felt more comfortable wearing the hijab.,and

44262_1,These other countries are  places where people make a living  well.,"they have the same goals like we do,  having a healthy life, maintaining a family, etc.",as

42975_8,that means there was possibly something that made him think of it.,That means this idea that we have about equality and fair treatment for everybody isn't real.,and
45574_1,"In fact, it is the exact opposite of the story I knew.",I was taught the story in my previous years of schooling.,and
44479_1,The fact that our government allowed this oppression to happen.,They justified it.,and
42861_4,I admire his unbiased opinion towards american people.,Even with what happened to him and his family due to the U.S.,as

46143_1,We have tried so hard to keep them from competing with our race at all costs.,I still feel that this is sometimes true in todays world.,and
44765_2,The dialogue made me more conscious of ideas about hijabs that Id had.,A part of me thought it was sexist that Muslim women wear them.,and
43270_2,White supremacist Dylann Roof killed nine African-American churchgoers.,Dylann Roof injured three more.,and

45913_4,how do we stop having these thoughts  they arent dispelled by the people who have lived?,People can answer them first hand.,if
45666_1,It isn't healthy to hold onto anger  long.,my entire reason why i am living is  my family.,for

43236_2,i like it,i feel ok,when
42859_4,We need to spread our knowledge to our family and peers to eliminate the phobia of the Middle East,it is faultless people who are losing so much of their lives due to the war.,because
46365_1,"Yes, it did happen many years ago.",we didnt do this.,and
44353_1,Americans turn a blind eye to something like this.,That is  t negative.,because

43802_1,"As a whole nation, globe, community we should be able to accept everyone.",We should be able to accept those a little bit different than us.,if
46324_1,"After slavery ended, they had nothing.",White people had everything.,so
43874_2,I agree with Sam.,"He mentions we hear about Muslims killing other people, how they are terrorists, etc.",when
44645_5,"There are people who still see black people as less than a person than white people, which is completely absurd. ",but it is an injustice within society.,and
45540_1,We can talk to people.,We can educate them about where the United States has gone wrong in the past.,and
44088_1,Congress by all means is not doing anything.,The President takes it upon themselves to act with unilateral action.,so

43401_1,That's clearly far from the truth.,It's show in the slides.,as
44272_5,distant to other nations.,they are always aware of what happens here.,when
45257_4,We can make people understand.,We can make people become better.,for
45536_1,I guess being ignorant of history taught me a lot about racism.,By talking about racism today we are only increasing the divide.,so
43900_1,I only watch US news. ,I do not look at what is happening in other countries .,and
43021_1,We wouldnt want to associate things like that with our own land., It would make us look bad.,because
46007_2,The group that is usually in a position of superiority became the inferior group.,They were saying the same things.,when
44744_2,It is easy to find out information.,It's on the tip of our fingertips.,so
45726_2,He was not angry with Americans.,He was not angry at life in general.,and
44710_4,Sam told us that Bassim was on the screen skyping with this class.,We could hear his actual reaction.,when
46166_4,I think their main purpose was not disrespecting military.,They wanted people to listen to them,and
44623_1,There is a myth that black people are better at basketball.,Naturally it doesn't even make sense.,because
46454_4,It is important to ask questions about subjects.,Im not familiar with.,and
45844_6,I do not understand.,Empathy allows me to try seeing another point of view.,so
45181_4,It’s just their skin pigment that is different. ,They were born in the us. ,and
46252_5,Who still holding the hope for their country.,Who believe in their faith.,and
44044_1,You made a point about differentiating members of ISIS and the KKK.,It will stick with me a long time.,for

44585_5,I understand why he has those sentiments towards the United States.,He has those sentiments towards its leadership.,and
44522_1,I am completely unaware of all things that are going on in this world., I choose to only listen to the media.,because
45875_1,We have made stereotypes based only on few people.,We have made stereotypes out of many things that have happened. ,and
46161_4,"When she said those words, for a couple of seconds Sam turned to me.",we both shook our heads nodding approvingly.,and
44675_2,"""You never really understand a person until you consider things from their point of view...until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.""",This quote summarizes what this class is about.,for
44292_2,The average American thinks we significantly helped the Middle East.,They think we made everything much better.,so
44172_3,The people in it are fearful.,Fear leads to hate.,and
45843_2,Do not generalize people.,Understand something by understanding someone else.,and
45182_4,"Trying to play opposite roles, the students took turns trying to talk about their history.","At first, I think they found it hard to get into character.",for
44702_5,It was intense.,It was impactful.,and

44098_1,We need big military bases all over the world.,We do not need to step our foot into every issue.,and
46273_5,It is frustrating.,The United States was founded by white men.,because
45901_2,Basim said we all need to be more aware.,We all need to be more aware of what is happening in other countries.,when
43763_1,He used his religion to help him through this ordeal.,He looks forward to his surviving son getting married.,and
44737_1,Having the 6 students play along with the role reversal helped me.,I visualize the possible excuses of both sides.,and
44764_1,There was a talk on hijabs.,It made them feel safer.,and
42905_1,This group praises the death of soldiers on a daily basis.,This group condemns homosexuality as a sin on a daily basis.,and
45017_7,They talk about what happened in the past with slavery.,It shows how insensitive white people can be.,and

44525_1,It is extremely important.,We need to learn about different ethnicities.,Nan

42967_2,"To be honest, listening to Basim talk, I tried putting myself in his shoes.",I tried asking myself what I would should something like this happen to me.,if
46137_2,"We took away any rights, banned them from our schools, stores, even having the ability to acquire property.",We took away any rights to own money.,and
46461_3,Female breasts are very different than male breasts.,Female breasts are more sexualized than male breasts.,because
45291_5,I was a white person sitting in the classroom.,It was a whirlwind trying to keep up.,because
46424_2,I personally never judged anyone who wore a hijab.,I did not think that wearing one for religious purposes was a big deal.,and
43552_1,Our students should be more aware of what is going on in the world.,They should be more aware why the United States is involved in the conflicts that it is today.,and
44956_6,"Sitting in discussion, I understood why many chose not to.",I felt the same with November 7th growing near.,so
44957_1,"For the first time, I wondered.",Their votes would have even made a difference.,and
44994_2,People are unable to put themselves in the shoes of others.,People are unable to think about what they are feeling.,and
43985_1,I thought my education has been good.,I have learned a lot.,and
45784_1,Hearing someone open their heart tell their story about racism helps.,"Hearing stories of racism, cruelty towards humans, that will help.",and
45650_3,The white people were making great points for their case.,The black people were just dodging their questions.,because
44589_2,We categorize other people based of religion.,When it comes to our own we are the first to defend ourselves.,and
43957_2,There is so much more going on than what we might see covered.,it is only up to us to find those stories.,and
46418_1,"The history of America is full of injustice, racism, does not mean American's are that way.",Someone should not be determined by their ancestors. ,and
44736_2,I feel like many people would not be fans of this conquest.,many people would only see the terrible nature of this historical fact.,and
43058_1,"One day, I saw my mother crying.",Her uncle was killed.,because
43264_1,They are fighting for equality.,They saw that they had to fight for it in the 60s.,because
45532_1,I think everyone should take classes like those.,It's our nation's history.,because
45948_2,It allowed people to open up more.,It allowed more honest past mindsets to shine through.,and
46293_1,I liked how the one girl compared it to wearing a big comfy sweater.,I can really relate to that feeling more comfortable covered up.,when

42813_2,It just really frustrates me that there are people out there that will look at all police officers and question their intentions.,Few are actually corrupt.,because
44376_2,"The people of the United States wonder, is there anything that we can do to help?",There are innocent people being hurt.,if
45921_1,The majority of the time we do not want to listen to the outside people.,In our opinion they are wrong.,because
45567_1,A lot of Americans give George Bush a lot of hate for his actions abroad.,"The fact that a man who lives in one of the countries George Bush occupied with US troops says he sees no difference between him, Obama, and Trump, is eye opening.",Nan
43904_2,The blame lies with the individual who fails to understand.,The information being presented to them is not complete.,Nan
44234_1,This is where I can say I agree with Sam Richards.,So many Americans are being hypocrites.,and
44018_1,"What if America, my home, was taken over by a militant group?",I was forced to follow their ways.,and
43426_3,People tend to ignore the Christian on Christian judgments.,There are little of these stereotypes.,because
44715_4,There was no reason for him to stay angry., the anger would just consume him.,because
43265_3,It is very hard to argue.,It isn't harder being black in America than it is for white people.,and
44952_5,There would have been complains regardless if Clinton were elected.,There would have been complains regardless if Trump was elected.,and
44467_1,The world did everything it could to make Basim cold hearted.,Basim is still a loving individual.,when
45607_2,I believe that more people should took the time to actually study.,I believe that more people should really get to know all the rules.,if
42847_1,Other countries and the people living in them are given a negative label because the American media only focus on specific violent groups such as ISIS.,ISIS may claim to be Muslim but do not act the same as other people in the country who are also Muslim.,Nan
44041_1,The media have somehow developed the power to choose what gets to be covered.,The media have somehow developed the power to choose what gets to be talked about.,and
42941_2,"Listening to someone with first hand experience, talk about their hardships.",How it personally affected their lives.,and
46478_1,Both ways of life are cool. ,There are benefits to both. ,and
42963_1,I would only hope., I could be as brave and forgiving as a person as him.,Nan
45458_5,"This is very true you must consider crime rates are lower, violent crimes have gone down.","These numbers are lower than they have ever been,  there is all coverage on crime.",so
43089_3,Everyone kept to themselves.,We live in a global society.,Nan
46309_6,Since black people ended up in a difficult situation, everything against them.,Nan
46362_3,why are you  talking about it?,A white student respond.,and
43674_2,The rest of their lives are broken.,Their lives are filled with the worst rage.,and
45971_3,Black people did not have any place to go.,Black people had no property.,and
45241_3,It is his constitutional right to not stand during the national anthem.,what he did is not disrespectful toward the flag.,as
46120_1,I don't remember the specifics of the class.,I remember the way I felt.,Nan
43670_1,Parents should attempt to do the same.,We can avoid being a country of ignorant people.,so
44762_2,Sam brought up modesty.,Whether he was calling her a hoe.,when
46221_1,I feel like this idea completely disproves any claim that one race is better than another.,They could be in the exact situation if they had a different past.,when
45442_1,"I too find it absolutely pathetic that our president, the person who is supposed to represent all people of the United States, calls out football players peacefully practicing their First Ammendment right as sons of bitches.",I too find it absolutely pathetic that our president refuses to say the same about Neo Nazis or KKK.,Nan
44694_2,Stories are being spread about the violence of groups following the same religion you do.,News reports are being spread about the violence of groups following the same religion you do.,as
45640_1,Less than 100 years ago the KKK was marching in Washington.,It was a racist organization.,as
43035_1, Something needs to be done about that.,Our country needs to respect other peoples values.,as
44793_2,It was uncomfortable.,It was hard to follow.,and
43476_2,An individual who has chosen to see.,An individual who has chosen to understand.,and
43232_1,We are being honest.,Those who violently attacked innocent people will probably walk away without charges.,if
45196_3,Way back in the 1400's mankind was less sophisticated.,Things that they did now days would be considered obscene.,as
44235_1,Luckily I can say I grew up on a place that was very diverse.,I had parent who were very open to everyone.,and
45243_2,Many of the critics are also Trump supporters.,A good question to ask is why they kept quiet.,and
45144_1,Sam told the women not to be politically correct.,The women might think they were being mean.,because
45458_6,"This is very true you must consider crime rates are lower, violent crimes have gone down.","These numbers are lower than they have ever been,  there is all coverage on crime.",so
44597_1,We should be focusing on other countries that are in need of help.,We should not be focusing on believing the media all the time.,and
46411_3,Were it a black person it would be all over the news,Imagine it was a white person,if
42842_3,I felt a part of me wanting to show more empathy,I felt a part of me wanting to be more concerned and aware of what happens outside of the United States.,and
44914_3,Black people say black lives matter.,Most people believe we only care about black lives.,when
44118_2,"Not being able to discuss religion, at a younger age especially makes us ignorant.",It makes us naive to those around us.,and
46100_1,We were forced to reverse roles.,It was definitely a little confusing.,because
44958_1,I think this video relates mainly with my check-out question.,It has always been said that presidents never deliver their promises.,if
43825_2,it make feel good,i like it,for
43261_2,I was expecting a larger number.,I think that it stems from the media fixating on one thing.,and
42950_3,This is something I cannot forgive our military.,every single life matters.,for
46307_1,It was really hard to progress in that context. ,It was really hard to succeed in that context. ,and
46282_7,You cannot use them they are not a backbone of beliefs.,"We all can see, it is easy to skew numbers in someones favor.",as
43143_5,some victims were rumored to be younger,he wanted to have sex with them and would threaten with violence and imprisonment,Nan
44038_3,It happened. ,it was done by a group of Muslims.,because
44182_2,He said he is not.,It was many Americans who have helped him after the tragedy in his life.,because
44038_5,it was done by a group of Muslims., the media did what they do best which is to generalize. ,because
44519_1,I don't know about everyone in this discussion group.,I was only taught certain things about the American culture in history class.,for
43423_1,"For many, this is challenging to do.","This is especially challenging for those people who we do not know, with different cultures and perspectives.",Nan
43114_2,It makes sense.,majority of Christians are white people.,if
45699_2,I only believed things I knew.,I only perceived based off what I knew.,and
43757_3,We judge their community.,We judge their situation without thinking once.,and
43806_5,I support what they are protesting.,I can see why some people would be frustrated with it.,as
46376_3,That doesn't take away any of its importance in our country's history.,That doesn't take away any of its relevance in our country's history.,and
43476_1,I think that Basim is an individual.,An individual who has chosen to see.,and
43770_3,There is corruption in,There is corruption in the governmen.,as
45127_1,The international issues between races and groups always differ. ,The conflict will change depending on time period or current events. ,and
46073_1,I couldn't get over how someone would have to basically force themselves back into slavery type conditions.,To be able to eat.,Nan
44557_6,It is an argument in favor of something.,It is an argument against something.,for
43044_2,having that conversation with Basim changed the way I view other people,It even changed how I view the United States.,and
44062_3,It's very important to take the time to understand their issues.,It's very important to see what you can do to help.,and
45650_2,The white people were making great points for their case.,The black people were just dodging their questions.,and
43886_1,Learning about the faith will definitely open peoples eyes.,What they really have to do is get out there.,and
46476_3,Sam brought up a few women wearing hijabs as well as a few girls who did not.,They got to ask each other questions.,because
45635_4,It is important to make sure people know the real story in regards to slavery in America,It is important to know how the slaves and black community were treated.,and
45206_3,"First, I understand why Sam wanted to switch roles.",He made the black people pretend to be white.,for
44911_1,That message stuck with me.,Our society is only Christians should they want to be.,when
42859_3,We need to spread our knowledge to our family and peers to eliminate the phobia of the Middle East,it is faultless people who are losing so much of their lives due to the war.,and
43004_2,live your life by the suggestions in the Quran or the Bible or the Torah or whatever holy book your religion follows.,don't let it turn you into an asshole to other people who choose not to follow them.,and
45362_4,This form of silent protest has been a way for athletes to stand up for what they believe to be right for a while now,more recently people are starting to see this form of protest as unpatriotic and disrespectful,Nan
44916_2,Sam mentioned how a white person was murdered by police.,A white person wasn't given justice. ,and
44228_3,They are truly the ones filled with hate.,This is what is so funny.,and
44072_2,They aren't detailed for the various situations.,Humans are put in.,Nan
44822_2,He could learn to forgive.,He could learn not to be judgmental.,if
46425_3,She would only wear her hijab the time her family came to visit.,She would only wear her hijab at home.,when
43195_1,I think we should've gone deeper into it.,A lot of the stats were very surface level.,because
44447_2,Black people are scared for their lives.,A police pulls them over.,because
43962_4,I believe that to truly make change in this country we have to come together.,by kneeling during the national anthem you create an even greater separation.,and
43138_2,They have served there.,that is not the same as the life of a civilian.,Nan
45079_2,You put yourself in someone else's shoes.,You look at yourself.,when
44694_5,News reports are being spread about the violence of groups following the same religion you do.,You should not feel guilty about it.,as
42803_2,He has seen a countless number of tragedies.,This has lead to the development of his PTSD.,and
43632_2,The media does not want to show world events.,The American people are not interested.,because
45023_3,I have realized that there is a significance to what is happening across the world.,It is important to be aware of what is going on.,and
45239_1,"However, the critics said he was disrespecting the flag, anthem, nation, the military.",The critics say everyone must stand during the national anthem.,when
45182_2,"Trying to play opposite roles, the students took turns trying to talk about their history.","At first, I think they found it hard to get into character.",and
44025_2,He is just trying to live out his life.,He is trying to provide for his family.,and
46347_1,This kind of hatred is almost unimaginable.,This hatred does not happen to dangerous criminals.,and
45291_2,I think some of the points got lost in translation.,I was a white person sitting in the classroom.,as
43951_1,I found it very true., Bassim said that people need to learn more about the world outside of their country.,Nan
44793_5,It was hard to follow.,The conversations were built.,as
43148_1,I am sure.,We could find blame to be aimed at any direction.,if
46217_2,Sam molded this story of oppressive Blacks and enslaved Whites.,It became apparent why he chose this exercise.,as
43796_2, Sam showed the stats of white vs. black.,Sam showed who gets killed more.,when
44413_2,There are Muslims who use their religion for violence.,There are Muslims who use their religion for hate.,so
45520_1,I really understood.,I agree with your point.,and
42878_4,People are being affected.,More people will go out to help others.,Nan
43118_4,majority of those people are not Muslim.,people cannot stop the stereotype anyway,Nan
44212_1,I can’t help to feel sad. ,I also feel responsible.,and
43299_1,We all have equal chances to succeed.,This is true to a certain degree.,Nan
43371_2,I know that other people have that type of mindset towards Muslims.,That is crazy to me especially after taking to Bassim.,and
45923_1,Fishes are always in the Water  they do not really know much about it; unlike us.,we see it from the outside we are not always expose to it.,because
44674_4,I thought that was good to see.,Basim did not look to his religion for answers.,if
43279_4,I enjoyed learning about their cultures.,I feel like it isn't talked about as it deserves to be.,because
44642_1,We are the ones who created war,We are the ones who can end it,and
45065_1,He began with the song.,I immediately listened.,because
46299_3,I really wonder.,It has more to do with culture.,if
44303_1,I know.,I would barely be able to control myself.,and
43332_7,It was a bombing by the American government that went awry.,It was never supposed to hit Basim's house.,because
43801_1,We are all the same.,We just have different preferences on how we may do things.,Nan
46233_2,It brings us back to the way men look at women in these cultures.,It brings us back to the expectations we have of them.,and
45853_1,This was a problem.,The majority of NFL players were black people.,because
44390_1,It's almost selfish to support the well-being of the United States.,Very often many have to suffer to keep it this way.,because
43986_5, We can choose to believe them.,We can decide ourselves what is true.,for
44877_1,One fact that really stood out involved the slave trade.,Sam talked.,when
45849_2,We flipped the role.,I began to think about the image of God a s a black person.,when
43837_1,Americans learn this.,It is all the news is telling them.,because
45973_2,This put them into more dangerous position.,They had to sign a contract.,because
43279_3,I enjoyed learning about their cultures.,I feel like it isn't talked about as it deserves to be.,and
44860_2,We are all still of the same country at the end of the day.,The game is really all in good fun.,and
43344_2,"Fate would have it, we were born in the U.S.",Most of us are shielded from these kinds of things.,as
46126_1,I personally try to never judge in a negative way.,"Most thoughts seemed to be naive, immature.",and
46443_4,Mark said it's not the physical aspect that is hard.,You have your mind under control.,as
44492_4,Basims life was turned upside., he lost everything but he was still able to find his spark.,and
43277_2,It would mitigate ethnic conflicts.,"They stem from information we gain online, not directly.",and
46251_4,It is unpredictable how many homes have been lost.,It is unpredictable how many cities have been destroyed.,and
45381_1,This is not a time to focus on the country.,gather for entertainment purposes.,Nan
44936_3,There were some general questions I had.,They were asked in class.,if
45954_2,They were not making more than a general point.,They were making personal ones.,and
44469_1,I could be in his position.,I would like to believe him.,as
44227_3,That emphasizes evilness.,Many are far from that.,when
45922_1,The example that Sam uses is a great example.,We are like fish in the water.,Nan
46315_1,This lecture is primary about that.,Which was refreshing.,and
44668_4,We don’t have slaves anymore. ,Black people are still being oppressed. ,and
45046_3, that might sound like the ideal thing.,It does not matter how hard some people work.,and
46032_3,We watch Mr. Evans.,He goes on a journey through the middle east.,as
45236_1,He took this sort of action to oppose standing up to a flag whose country oppresses black people.,He took this sort of action to oppose standing up to a flag whose country oppresses other minorities.,for
44539_1,"In fact, many veterans are taking a knee.",They are allies for the civil rights movement.,because
42871_3,We live in a bubble. ,We don’t truly understand what we are. ,and
46465_1,I knew Muslim women had the privilege of dressing.,Like this in front of their husbands.,Nan
45561_6,The statistics came back.,Unarmed people were shot by the police.,Nan
46302_2,They said it's different for every individual.,"In some cases, it represents different things.",and
42892_1,"Yes, there are probably bad police officers in this world.",There are many good ones too.,Nan
46470_1,Like all of the other religions it depends on how religious you are.,These women could follow the religious dress code.,Nan
46392_5,Explaining our history was eye-opening to me.,It happened to white people.,as
42938_1,Basim knew there were a lot of Americans he got to know.,There were some he called his close friends.,and
44152_4,Americans often have a lot of pride towards our leaders. ,Americans feel pride toward our country .,as
43741_1,We can all learn a lot from his reaction.,He was able to see past our military.,and
42872_3,It really is an amazing opportunity to listen to what he talks about. ,It does open your eyes.,because
45563_2,Media platforms must present information that the public wants to see.,Even if they are just reiterating the same facts over and over again.,Nan
43234_5,They are meant to protect this country.,Minorities are part of this country.,because
43322_6,We call their ideas weird.,We call their ideas backwards.,and
44271_2,It showed that he was able to see past those who killed his family.,He was able to see past those who ruined his life.,and
45208_2,It came down to it.,I believe.,when
44063_2,I feel the same way sometimes.,I was never really taught about it.,because
43733_3,It can be interpreted in many ways.,Many different people could have different views.,Nan
45363_4,I see where they are coming from.,It may be a way for them to get away from politics.,because
43864_2,I feel like there is such a societal political standard for what is expected of the president.,Often times citizens find themselves not pleased with the president they voted for.,as
45674_1,They are the lawmakers.,They can just make laws to keep it very similar to slavery.,so
46198_1,The hijab itself is not sexist at all in my opinion.,No one should be forced to wear a hijab.,as
43632_1,I cannot see the media changing its ways.,The media does not want to show world events.,because
46193_2,I do not condemn anyone that chooses to wear a hijab.,Some aspects of the hijab are expressions of religious beliefs.,as
46001_6,He has influence under his belt.,His actions and words can only reach so far.,and
43962_3, the national anthem  creates a sense of patriotism.,I believe that to truly make change in this country we have to come together.,and
45804_5,They actually don't believe it.,They know.,because
45808_2,you havent visited their land or just talked to any 5 Muslims in America to see that that stereotype simply isnt true.,they are very peaceful individuals.,and
44874_2,There's no way for anything to change.,It has to be talked about.,and
45139_1,It's sad.,People in the US criticize those who enter the United states from the outside.,when
43602_2,Try to say those hate groups are formed due to jealousy of the United States.,I believe it is more due to the many innocent civilians.,so
45086_1,The men had to sit there.,The men had to pretend.,and
43625_2,I was able to have access to that.,I have met many people from different cultural backgrounds.,and
45759_4,They could think about the facts of American History.,They could make it evident that we need to question the white people's tactics.,and
44984_2,I think that should be emphasized more in this day.,I think that should be emphasized more in this age.,and
44982_4,They should be able to believe in whatever they please.,They should be able to believe in whoever they please.,and
ID_3,Sub-Sentence 3,Sub-Sentence 4,Nan
43237_2, who were wrongly killed , who were wrongly killed ,Nan
43021_2, It would make us look bad.,Why do people in the U.S. make such quick judgements about people who are different?,because
43232_2,Those who violently attacked innocent people will probably walk away without charges.,It is like white policeman who shoot unarmed black men.,when
45749_2,Distribute success and privilege to all races.,Provide everyone with an equal opportunity.,Nan
42846_2,People are free to practice whatever religion they want.,People are free to not be discriminated against.,and
43553_1,There are some of the things many Americans are not sure of.,It is important that we try to educate people more on what is going on.,and
43700_1,All these presidents promised.,New things throughout their campaign.,Nan
45647_3,White people are behind in society.,They were words.,because
44008_3,We see more black people getting shot.,We see more black people getting abused against on the internet and media.,and
44801_2,It goes for any ethnicity.,It goes for any difference in individuals that has caused tension throughout time.,and
46201_1,Dr. Richards brought up the point that there is a stigma often times that White Americans tend to not want to discuss,"They were topics like slavery, racism, and oppressive acts done to African Americans",Nan
45298_1,You don't know someone's life.,Truly diving in is nearly impossible.,and
45573_1,Obviously this was surprising.,This story was unlike any other story about American history I have ever been told or heard before.,so
43829_3,Loving and understanding others will become secondary nature.,We look at the heart instead of the differing exteriors.,when
44419_2,That is why I think it is important that we in the United States stop having prejudice against Muslims,That only feeds the hate.,for
46038_5,Maybe the military should be required to learn about the culture of the countries they enter.,it could stop many tragedies from happening.,if
45020_1,They reacted as If they didn't care at all.,They should basically just get over it,and
45978_2,It shed an amount of light on us.,It gave us insight as to what the war is doing to the people there and how it affects him.,Nan
45282_3,Foster children are most likely to be African American.,The case worker is racially biased a lot of the time.,for
44937_2,They wear hijabs.,They have different reasons.,for
45796_1,I still agree with what the protest stands for.,I don't agree with the sudden flow of support for the protest.,Nan
42955_1,This is such a small request from us.,It is something we should already be doing.,and
45821_1,The girls in Hijabs really took pride in themselves.,They took pride in their beliefs.,and
45351_1,"We, Americans need to learn.",About the world through different outlets. ,as
43941_1,There was significant global opposition to the war.,The United States government still invaded Iraq.,Nan
44982_5,They should be able to believe in whatever they please.,They should be able to believe in whoever they please.,and
43361_10,it is much easier to see people who are Islamic as bad., because some people who are part of that religion have done some dreadful things.,so
43877_1,That leads to another point that Sam made.,You can't do fucked up things.,when
44996_5,We call Muslim extremists Muslims.,terrorists as Muslims.,and
44707_3,I think that we should be more active when black people feel like they are not being heard. ,I think that we should be more cooperative when black people feel like they are not being heard. ,so
44504_2,Many conflicts have emphasized the sectarian divide.,It tears communities apart.,Nan
43986_3, We can choose to believe them.,We can decide ourselves what is true.,and
44630_1,My parents weren't very pleased.,I explained.,when
44189_3,That seems to be the only reason a Muslim would do something terrible.,"They do terrible things because of their religion, not their distorted views. ",and
44966_1,I am honest with myself.,Class really did emphasize the faults in the arguments white people make.,if
45434_4,They wear bikinis in their homes.,They wear them around only women.,and
44089_6,When they get to the office they find out it's much harder to do.,They can't find a better solution than what's already in place.,so
43856_1,They are essentially saying.,Soldiers lives aren't as important as my communitys lives.,Nan
46226_1,This activity was interesting.,Sam brought to light some questions.,because
45729_3,It was not benefiting him.,He realized it was time to let go.,so
42845_5,Who may be feeling discriminated against or have been living their life in fear everyday, every day because their country has been at war for years.,Nan
46306_3,Many post civil war decisions were made by white people.,The decisions made by white people benefit those in control.,for
42850_2,i feel good,i like it,and
43691_1,It's important people understand that that is not true.,It is only a small percentage.,and
44830_2,Lacking the knowledge of Iraqi citizens.,Lacking the  experience with Iraqi citizens.,and
46146_1,I was really inspired.,"The first few months, I was numb.",when
46369_2,They say that they need attention.,They say it was years ago.,and
45208_3,I believe.,Switching the sides only made the matter much more difficult to understand.,Nan
45831_2,His forgiveness is inspiring.,His strength is inspiring.,so
45852_1,I hope many people in the class learned.,I have learned.,and
46083_3,Reconstruction took place during this time.,"It caused black peoples lives to be much worse,",and
45734_4,One third is full of people who want equality.,The last third does not care about anything.,and
44548_2,His experience with the foster homes was sad.,His culture had to mix with non-native American culture in terms of his hair getting cut.,and
46347_4,This hatred does not happen to dangerous criminals.,This hatred happens to young children.,and
44038_7, the media did what they do best which is to generalize. ,ever since then that link exists.,and
43361_1,It is much easier to see flaws in others than to see it in ourselves.,we are a mostly Christian nation it is hard to see that Christians could be doing all these dreadful things,because
43475_1,You mentioned you wondered why Basim wasn't angry.,you wondered why most of the class wrong.,and
44307_6,It is hard to tell the difference between leaders.,All of these leaders have further increased the damage done to civilians in Iraq.,when
44102_1,"Specifically, Sam said that in past semesters, he has touched on different issues that were relevant to their respective times. ",Like we’ve been going over international issues.,Nan
45194_5,Others were blind to the problem or learned something eye-opening.,I think its a big step forward and don't stop there.,for
44715_3,He explained to us.,There was no reason for him to stay angry.,because
44707_1,I think that we should be more active when black people feel like they are not being heard. ,I think that we should be more cooperative when black people feel like they are not being heard. ,and
45929_1,I really liked how he touched on that.,It's how the racial status that the United States has today was started.,Nan
45533_3,The statistics were about wealth.,The statistics were about racial jobs.,and
42785_3,He educates others.,He shares his stories.,and
46282_3,"Statistics can lie, you cannot take them at face value always.",You cannot use them they are not a backbone of beliefs.,as
43634_1,It is important to have a world view.,We should find a way to spark curiosity in American people about global issues.,so
43777_4,They think we are their enemies. ,They think we have somehow wronged them. ,and
44917_1,I want to talk about what has been going on lately.,It is taking a knee when the national anthem plays.,Nan
45099_1,I think that it would have been beneficial to have learned about.,It would have helped me better understand society.,and
45055_1,I would agree with your statement.,"Empathy is one of the most important, human traits that a person can have.",Nan
42956_1,I heard Bassim talk.,It really opened my eyes to a lot of new things,and
43131_2,Not everyone HAS to agree with this. ,If someone wants to protest during the national anthem by silently putting their fist up or taking a knee then let them.,because
43361_3,we are a mostly Christian nation it is hard to see that Christians could be doing all these dreadful things, it is hard to see that Christians could be a part of many horrific hate groups.,and
44985_1,My opinion of the video was quite eye opening.,It was something that that allowed students to actually realize what happened in the past.,Nan
44413_3,There are Muslims who use their religion for hate.,There are Christians who do this too.,and
46083_1,The white people did not want black people to put them out.,They chose to give them nothing.,so
45926_1,I think.,We should be more open minded.,Nan
45844_5,I do not understand.,Empathy allows me to try seeing another point of view.,for
42831_2,I never thought about how this class changes.,It changes from year to year.,Nan
44796_4,We learned about it in school.,This exercise made me feel like one of them.,and
45917_2,We do not really know what is going on.,We are in the situation.,because
45006_2,I believe these players have the ability to use other media outlets.,Players can really go into detail to try to tell people that changes need to be made.,Nan
44118_4,It makes us naive to those around us.,"Makes us naive ot the beliefs not being able to discuss religion, at a younger age especially makes us ignorant",and
45226_2,Afghanistan is shown to be a war torn desolate place where you only find an oppressive regime.,Afghanistan is shown to have poverty.,and
45216_2,By the end of this class I feel like I am now more empathetic.,I  am more aware of what other people around the world have to go through.,and
44289_1,I hope something can be done to help these people.,These people have suffered.,as
43872_2,He then converted to islam.,He classifies as an atheist.,and
44632_2,They created a divide between me and other members of my family.,They didn't want their kids to know about other religions.,because
45314_1,Here's the argument the black people make.,It wasn't us.,Nan
45914_5,It's difficult.,It's awkward.,because
45352_1,We see.,They want us to see.,so
45202_2,White people are not the first humans in history to use slaves.,White people are the last people to use slaves in history.,Nan
46101_1,As it went on I got really into it. ,I tried my best to imagine it the was Sam wanted us to. ,and
43952_2,Many people have a lot of misconceptions about other countries.,Many people have a lot of misconceptions about other cultures.,and
45135_2,There is human nature of competition.,There is human nature of collectivization.,because
45604_2,I did not know much about the Muslim religion at all going into this lecture. ,Finding out that wearing the hijab was actually a choice was actually kind of a surprise for me.,and
46179_3,To understand from women who do wear hijabs that they do it for themselves.,They want to wear it.,and
44190_1,ISIS and other terrorist groups happened.,Many movies depicted Muslims in a certain light.,and
46309_3,Slavery was stopped.,Also a step backwards.,and
42793_1,Basim embraced the fact that he was kept alive to share his stories.,"Hoping that at the time our generation controls the world, we would be more compassionate.",when
43362_1,There are many Christians who are part of the KKK.,There are many Christians who consider themselves neo-Nazis.,as
43101_1,I was born here,I was raised here,and
44261_2,We are closer than we think.,New technologies are available to bring us together.,because
44197_1,It is easy for us to hear things in the news.,It is easy to be unaffected by it.,and
45970_4,The racial issues have been worse.,Black people were slaves.,when
44545_3,We took their ancestors lives.,We completely manipulated their population.,and
43741_3,We can all learn a lot from his reaction.,He was able to see past our military.,so
45423_4,The issue of equal opportunity is alive.,and prevalent.,and
43406_1,"We are quick to call Muslims or those from Iraq bombers,terrorists.","In reality, we terrorize their people as well.",so
44475_2,Any of the things that happened to black had happened to white people.,It would have been a way bigger deal.,if
44417_3,Injured 19 others is not very different.,From the terrorist attack in Spain.,and
44815_6,I thought that it is common in American.,They stereotype other people easily.,for
43604_1,The United States will not stop doing airstrikes.,Due to these instances.,because
44391_1,Immigration is incredibly strict.,We profit off of outsourced low paying jobs.,Nan
45020_6,It happened in the past.,Its much different today.,because
42838_2,They do not understand them.,It is not happening right in front of them.,and
45164_4,"It says, ""Every woman who prays... with her head uncovered dishonors her head.""",for that is one and the same as if her head were shaved.,Nan
44991_8,They should take the time to look over the history of what happened.,It would be quite eye opening.,and
44318_1,Many people see the war in the Middle East strictly being involved with terrorism.,In reality some of the these terrorist issues were created from past wars.,when
45184_1,I think about if different students were to come down.,I think about if they did the same thing for a different topic.,and
44991_9,They should take the time to look over the history of what happened.,It would be quite eye opening.,and
46010_1,"That is, when people hear protests from an oppressed group, many times they just brush it off.",many times they just assume those people are over reacting.,and
44510_1,Trump has completely figured out how to work the media in his favor.,They are shitting on him.,when
44647_3,I would have never known the alarming statistics.,The statistics prove that black people have been placed in an unfair position.,Nan
46197_3,We complete autonomy in regards to personal decisions. ,We alone are the only ones who can judge ourselves. ,and
43910_1,These christian hate groups havent killed american soldiers or lives.,This is the main reason.,and
45493_1,Police officers are tasked with upholding and enforcing the law.,They are required to have a high school diploma.,and
46295_1,"Going out in public, I usually will wear long-sleeves.",I won't if it is really hot out.,if
43127_5,Everyone follows the national anthem.,Everyone follows the pledge of allegiance without ever questioning its meaning or history.,and
45365_4,They put their lives on the line every single day.,It's so they are able to play football.,for
43689_2,A lot of people associate them with ISIS and other terrorist groups.,That is what is shown in the media.,because
45512_1,White people tend to ignore it.,It doesn't affect them.,because
45421_3,Say we reverse history.,it is the white people who feel oppressed,so
42853_3,"In England, many people were aware of what was occurring in the Middle East. ",Not many Americans had a comprehensive idea.,because
46271_5,The major thing that I have learned is that it is  important to have empathy towards people.,It is  extremely important to see things from different perspectives.,and
44287_3,During their campaign the begin with false promises. ,They are unable to attain those ideas. ,when
44299_1,I'm sure.,The American soldiers did not intentionally cause harm to Basims people.,Nan
45810_1,Actually seeing the screenshots from slave history will stick in a lot of peoples heads.,It will hopefully make something click.,and
45418_4,Just one person in my family died from something so tragic I would not be able to cope for the longest time.,"All I would be able to think would be, Why couldnt it be me?",if
45561_3,I was shocked.,The girls were shocked.,when
46362_5,A white student respond.,"you have this power ,privilege that you don't see this racism.",and
44976_1,I don't think it should be such a big task to take a few minutes out of our lives.,I don't think it should be such a big task to just talk to people who may have a different perspective than us.,and
43006_1,I understand what you mean.,You say you think it would be difficult to have responded the same way if it happened to you.,when
42845_2,I never took the time to step out of my shoes.,In to another person's shoes.,and
45023_4,It is important to be aware of what is going on.,It is important to not be indifferent.,and
45716_1,we learned of how the system was set up to put people of color behind white people., we learned of how the system was set up to put minorities behind white people I was shocked.,and
43455_1,"I believe that this is, in part, due to how society portrays the other.","I believe that this is, in part, due to how media portrays the other.",and
44823_1,Weve all heard about the Iraq war to some extent.,"Before Sam brought Basim in to talk about it, I had no knowledge of any details.",Nan
44804_2,It didn't seem oppressive to me.,It appeared as though they made a personal decision.,Nan
45905_1,A good example is the idea that all people from Iraq are associated with Isis.,That is not true.,and
45337_2,It was to give your upmost respect.,It was for the men who fought for this country.,and
44890_1,A few years ago my family decided to try something different.,We began to attend masses at a place called Jacksonville Chapel.,so
45257_1,It is hard to say what we can do.,We can make people understand.,and
43160_1,Those are the ones who are traitors to their own religion.,They do not speak on behalf of the billions of wonderful people who practice their religion.,and
44325_1,People would be very upset hearing the story of Basim's family.,The media sometimes does not publish these stories. ,and
44303_3,I would barely be able to control myself.,I would barely be able to control my anger.,if
46176_1,I think my favorite part of the class was in this video segment. ,The final message was delivered. ,Nan
44827_1,Clearly the collateral damage that would be caused by the war was underestimated.,"The lives of those in the middle east that would be affected by it were undervalued, or both.",Nan
44912_1,"It always seems like people say, yes of course I am a Christian.","There should not be a but , it comes to caring about other people.",when
42934_4,who ordered the bombs to be launched.,the government.,Nan
46459_1,we do the same thing in America.,it is considered public nudity.,Nan
43783_1,It was their perspective. ,Their perspective had them thinking it was correct.,Nan
44600_2,She protested black rights on the bus.,The purpose was not mobile transportation.,for
43764_4,They sought to harm people.,Many of us cannot forgive that.,and
44149_1,I don't necessarily think.,Basim has moved on.,Nan
45404_1,There really should be more strict rules.,Cops are allowed to use force.,when
44787_1,I think Basim is an amazing person.,Everyone should try to think about the struggles.,and
44672_4,Most of us could not control what the government does.,Their forces do things to other countries.,because
44205_2,It is easy for someone who does not believe in homosexuality to take use part of the Bible to fuel their justification.,They are against homosexuality.,for
44026_1,Basim is studying at Michigan in the United States for his master's degree.,Basim Personally does not have any problems with our country.,Nan
45369_1,My mom was in the United States Army for 8 years.,I thought it would be interesting to see her side to things.,and
44979_1,I'm going to continue working on making an effort to talk to different people.,It is beneficial for both people.,because
46230_2,stating that they dont feel pressured in any way.,"essentially, its their choice.",and
45415_2,some people do not call the church shooting a terrorist attack.,They would not hesitate if a middle eastern person did that.,so
44419_3,That is why I think it is important that we in the United States stop having prejudice against Muslims,That only feeds the hate.,so
43291_3,we should try not to support slavery like this,we grow up and start and interact with businesses ourselves.,and
46203_2,Negative history has occurred in America.,People pretend.,and
43449_2,"Religion, like many other facets of culture, can be hard to define.",Religion can fall victim to sometimes harsh opinions.,and
44649_3,it is hard to feel that someones clothing offends you,I personally have no opinion on what someone wears,because
46471_2,Most people have a perspective about Muslim women's dress.,My perspective of Muslim women's dress is similar.,as
45378_1,I think its important.,We focus on the U.S. territories.,and

46450_2,I automatically would've assumed.,Women wear hijabs.,Nan
46376_2,It happened long ago.,That doesn't take away any of its importance in our country's history.,so
46271_3,I have realized  many things in the first half of this semester from this class.,The major thing that I have learned is that it is  important to have empathy towards people.,so
45364_3,These athletes know that there is no better place for them to voice their opinions then on national television.,The whole country can see.,and
45850_5,It not only affects the time at the moment.,It affects centuries.,and
43778_1,mold our perspectives.,the media sensationalizes.,and
45313_1,People have always said that America is a white patriarchal society.,I have never really thought about how deeply it is ingrained in the government.,Nan
46505_1,We never came to terms with what happened.,We will be oblivious to all the wrongdoings happening even today.,so
46367_3,I hope that many people don't just look past those photos.,how long ago did it happened?,and
46127_1,We always walk by people.,We make judgments.,and
46296_1,"Like the one girl said, wearing a hijab means that you're not worried  much about yourself.",You're able to look out into the world without much worry.,so

46174_1,They were absolutely wonderful.,it was interesting to see their perspective about wearing it.,and

43637_2,"Therefore, it is of the upmost importance that Americans learn more about other people , through our media.","Therefore, it is of the upmost importance that Americans learn more about other people through our education system.",and
44160_2,The statistics are vastly different than what we think.,Racial inequality is prevalent  in our society.,because
44883_5,They reach social ceilings built by discrimination that impede their growth.,The reach economic ceilings built by discrimination that impede their growth.,and
44820_1,There are just many wrong things in this situation.,Basim chooses to turn the other cheek.,and
46471_3,Most people have a perspective about Muslim women's dress.,My perspective of Muslim women's dress is similar.,because

45178_5,The black families confused me.,The whole topic that we were discussing confused me.,and
46423_2,Unlike the girls who went to the front of class.,My roommate hated wearing her hijab.,Nan
44936_6,They were asked in class.,Does it get too hot underneath?,if

44761_1,Do younger Muslim women have a more tolerant perception on our female clothing?,THe influence of the 21st century.,because
45117_4,It seemed like the entire class was pretty shocked to see these statistics.,There's only one reason people have this image in their head of black people being killed by police officers more often.,and
46271_6,The major thing that I have learned is that it is  important to have empathy towards people.,It is  extremely important to see things from different perspectives.,and
46059_3,He swore to see out the law.,He swore to make the world better.,and
43363_3,They are forgiving like Bassim.,They think to themselves.,and
46469_1,"a Saudi government policy, women are not forced to cover themselves.",I thought they were.,as
43970_1,This took me by surprise.,All we see is black people being killed in the media.,because
44977_1,I always want to be learning new things.,I always want to be hearing different opinions.,and
45929_5,One civilization was a little bit more advanced in technology.,It was advanced in communication before the other.,because

44932_5,We should stop the cycle.,People would be better than oil.,and
45421_4,it is the white people who feel oppressed,The black people who are deemed racist and in a position of higher power,and
44883_3,Blacks worked harder.,They reach social ceilings built by discrimination that impede their growth.,so
42962_1,He is a true role model in my eyes.,He is someone who is so genuine.,and
43628_1,I did not travel.,I was younger.,when
45916_1,I chose this video.,Sam made a really good point at the beginning of the video.,because
46260_5,Our country does not get the recognition that it needs.,Our country sure does not get attention from white people. ,and
43954_1,I find it astounding.,Geography is an important course in our early education.,and
46323_3,But slaves had places to live on the plantations.,Slaves had laws protecting them.,as
44704_2,Here's an example.,Sam asked the girl sitting on the white side.,when
45196_4,Things that they did now days would be considered obscene.,Things that they did now days would be considered offensive.,and
43387_2,We definitely do not have the same opportunities.,Racial bias hinders equality. ,as

42837_2,They are suffering only because of their geographic location.,They  we are able to help them instead of just helping ourselves.,and
45559_1,80% of media when it talks about black people is who was arrested.,80% of media when it talks about black people is what violent crimes they have committed.,and
44585_4,I understand why he has those sentiments towards the United States.,He has those sentiments towards its leadership.,and
43669_1,I believe parents should explain these various opinions to their children.,Parents should give them access to them.,so

45636_2,It was interesting how Sam had our class switch roles.,Sam made people look at America's history.,so
45021_2,Especially towards this topic. ,The way they reacted to whites people was switched. ,because

46291_1,I really noticed how a hijab can frame a woman's face when the non-hijab-wearing woman tried on hijabs.,I really noticed how a hijab can draw attention to her facial features when the non-hijab-wearing woman tried on hijabs.,and
45682_1, It comes down to the intimidation.,It comes down to the fear of the unknown.,and
44516_2,At the same time it worked.,Who's really the bad guy in this situation?,so
45696_2,I think Basim ability to forgive is a lesson to everyone.,Holding a grudges it does more damage to you.,for
44415_1,I am Catholic.,I do not share the same ideals as white supremacists in the South.,Nan

46172_1,I genuinely wanted to answer them the best way I can. ,"Most importantly, via my view point. ",and
44175_1,It is up to us.,To actually go and research on our own.,so
43112_2,we need to find a way to express our thought.,we need to fight for the things that you deserve like equality for black racial group.,and
44086_1,They were specifically avoiding this.,They had just escaped from the monarch.,because
44902_1,What I knew is that the crisis in Iraq started at 2003.,The US army invaded Iraq.,when
45914_7,It's awkward.,you know that you are being insensitive.,because
43377_3,You are forced to view others as people that love their families just like you do.,It is a lot easier to practice treat others as you want to be treated.,and
43376_5,I think it's something a lot of adults tend to forget.,"They don't see others as real people sometimes, primarily in the context of war.",because
44198_2,I had never seen a prior Mosul pic..,I had never seen a subsequent Mosul pic.,and
45425_1,Sam spoke in terms of white people.,People with nonwhite names are discriminated against.,for
43077_1,They promise to aid the people,They promise to change the way of life,and
42838_1,Some people do not see these issues clearly.,They do not understand them.,and
44116_1,It comes down to it the overalls values between the religious groups.,They pretty much the same.,when
44316_1,With that said,its going to be hard on Iraq to come back from the damage ISIS has caused,for
44875_2,I have learned about the hardships that blacks had to face.,They are facing it.,and
44606_6,It is right.,"No one should be getting killed by the cops, being unarmed.",because
45652_1,"Hopefully, in the future society can continue with dialogues like this.",It will begin to further address these perceptions.,and
44204_2,They would not Hell according to the quote.,Most of class was not able to raise their hands.,Nan
44859_1,I agree it is within their rights to peacefully protest.,They draw attention to a movement they believe in.,and
44541_2,It is so recent.,It is so tragic.,and
46471_1,This is definitely one of my favorite lectures.,Most people have a perspective about Muslim women's dress.,because
43886_2,What they really have to do is get out there.,They have to experience their same experiences.,and
45635_2,it is important to spread awareness about what happened in Americas history,It is important to make sure people know the real story in regards to slavery in America,and
44493_1,I think it is amazing how he was able to forgive America.,I think it is amazing how he was able to not hold a grudge against any American.,and
45022_1,That is shameful.,There is an ample amount of technology that makes this information readily accessible to me in seconds.,when
44172_4,The people in it are fearful.,Fear leads to hate.,and
45018_4,It also showed how black people truly feel about the topic.,It must be frustrating when white people don't understand their perspective.,because
43631_1,The media rarely spends time talking about what is happening in other countries.,"The times they do talk about other countries, the story will be a small headline.",and
46333_3,I see the value in getting to know strangers.,I do not consider myself to be a very adventurous person.,and
43332_5,It was a bombing by the American government that went awry.,It was never supposed to hit Basim's house.,and
45434_2,They said they wear things like the American girls across from them.,They wear bikinis in their homes.,when
44212_4,I also feel responsible.,These are Aermicans.,because
42822_3,Christians can interpret the Bible differently.,Muslims can interpret the Quran differently.,when
43234_6,Minorities are part of this country.,They should be treated as such.,and
43919_3,They implement very different laws that affect the American people.,They implement very different laws that affect others around the world.,and
45892_3,My brother was at Penn State visiting me.,He also sat in on the class.,because
44740_2,American education systems literally teach about how white europeans enslaved Africans.,They forced them to build the country we all call home now.,and
45601_5,There are plenty of videos.,There are statistics that show evidence of this fact.,and
45025_1,"Living in a world that is constantly evolving, it is expected that the topics.",Ideas discussed in a class about race are inclined to vary each semester.,and
45171_1,I am starting to see people.,I am starting to see who they really are.,for
43939_2,Many Americans at the time felt.,The war was unnecessary.,and
45411_3,He arrested her.,There was no reason.,for
43441_1,We are quick to pass judgment.,"In reality, we have many similarities.",so
45618_2,That will only cause more tragedies happen.,To forgive his enemies there is no other way that will benefit not only him,because
44347_3,money was raised,humanitarian efforts were made for places like Texas and Louisiana,Nan
43806_1,I do support the right these individuals have to protest.,I support what they are protesting.,and
43315_3,We can gain a better understanding of what it's like to live in their shoes. ,It can influene us to make better choices as a country. ,Nan
45851_1,Due to the racial issue that happened 400 years ago.,It effects the whole society.,because
45799_4,we judge their culture from afar.,We assume that all Muslims act the way we see the select few of them act on the news.,and
44207_3,It was their property.,"It was their income, etc.",Nan
44739_3,The volunteer students made comments to each other.,The volunteer students attempted to back up a party that they are foreign to.,as
43574_2,The hate would sit in my heart towards that government.,The hate would be immense.,Nan
43056_1,It was a genocide for Shias.,It was a genocide for all people who did not agree with him.,and
46367_4,I hope that many people don't just look past those photos.,how long ago did it happened?,as
45662_3,It really opened my eyes to the truth.,It was not what the media wants us to think.,because
45914_1,I was supposed to go up to ask questions.,I don'It know if I would be able to ask questions that aren't PC.,and
46020_3,People are focusing too much on this issue.,There are many other things that need to be brought to the attention of the public.,so
45027_2,His intention is to challenge us,His intention is to push us to think outside of the box.,and
44977_4,I always want to be hearing different opinions.,I just stay set in my own ways.,because
43209_2,An officer is comfortable saying don't worry we only shoot black people jokingly.,We have a serious problem.,if
45513_1,Basim was put in an unimaginable situation.,His home was destroyed.,Nan
45012_5,We see headlines.,We immediately believe whatever is said.,and
45238_1,Supporters understood him.,He mentioned racial injustices still happening in the US.,when
43363_1,There are many people who are very peaceful.,They are forgiving like Bassim.,and
45043_1,Slavery is gone. ,Racism is not. ,because
46361_6,I listened to them.,it made me see what happened many years ago in a different way.,and
46009_1,A lot of the times people do not feel that someones argument is valid.,They need to have personally seen.,Nan
42799_1,ISIS was able to bomb civilians homes.,There was nothing to be done about it.,and
44526_1,We are able to see different perspectives people have.,We are able to learn different perspectives people have.,so
43889_2,We are closing ourselves off to new outlooks.,We are closing ourselves off to new perspectives.,and
44711_2,I thought he would be blaming all Americans for the loss of his wife.,I thought he would be blaming all Americans for the loss of his relatives.,and
45607_4,I believe that more people should really get to know all the rules.,I believe that more people should really get to know principals of other religions,and
45957_1,I really liked this exercise.,I think white people were better able to picture what it might be like.,because
44103_3,I think its crazy he he tries hard to reach the issues from many different angles.,His lecture covers almost covers every single angle.,and
42891_1,A police officer's job is to protect people.,Sometimes police officers have to hurt people to do their job.,so
46282_8,You cannot use them they are not a backbone of beliefs.,"We all can see, it is easy to skew numbers in someones favor.",because
44184_1,Many people had family that were killed during the 9 11 attacks.,Thankfully I did not.,Nan
43795_1,Kneeling for a flag or the national anthem isn't a big deal.,You need to consider all of the other stuff you are not supposed to do.,if
44425_4,His voice held passion like a drum.,The sincerity of it all was there.,and
45181_3,It’s just their skin pigment that is different. ,They were born in the us. ,and
45575_2,Black people faced as slaves in this country.,Black people are still facing slavery to this very day.,and
44103_6,His lecture covers almost covers every single angle.,It  reaches every single student sitting in his lecture hall.,and
46409_1,The other disadvantage of having the lecture set up this way is that it makes it very difficult for whites to be able to defend themselves.,It would be very easy to chalk up their claim as being racist.,because
46517_1,The opinions are asked.,Someone wears a hijab.,for
42800_1,I could not imagine the immense grief they must have felt at that time.,I could not imagine the immense fear they must have felt at that time.,and
43143_1,He would simply finda,His youngest recorded victim was 12,and
43769_3,Obama used to be President. ,Trump is now President. ,and
45696_1,I think Basim ability to forgive is a lesson to everyone.,Holding a grudges it does more damage to you.,because
43114_3,majority of Christians are white people.,They dont think about terrible things.,and
45443_3,Only a few others participated.,I feel more NFL teams are taking part now in retaliation to Trumps comments.,and
43109_1,The US is not a perfect country.,We are better off than people in countries like iraq.,Nan
46414_2,Those who did not attempt to flee the scene were mostly White people.,"Those who were unarmed were mostly White people (8 White, 4 Black, 4 Hispanic, 1 other).",and
44667_2,Don’t all white arguments sound ridiculous,It sounds crazy. ,Nan
43376_2,"Growing up, I was taught the golden rule.",I think it's something a lot of adults tend to forget.,and
44694_3,Stories are being spread about the violence of groups following the same religion you do.,News reports are being spread about the violence of groups following the same religion you do.,when
43777_5,They think we are their enemies. ,They think we have somehow wronged them. ,because
42823_3,They might think we are all bad.,They have heard of the bad people who have participated in crimes in the name of Christianity.,and
46330_1,I had never heard of the empty quarter before this lecture.,It was a surprise to me.,so
43736_4,all we hear about the Middle.,all we hear about the Middle.,and
43534_1,Many people in this country have a flat opinion.,About Muslim people in Islamic countries.,for
43243_4,It's not just Muslim women.,It's not just our wearing of hijab.,and
44706_4,"Being a white person, she was able to recognize that.",I'm sure that most white people can understand that.,and
44037_1,I think.,"After 9 11, all these concepts started to circulate more and more.",when
45219_1,It seems so silly to break down a society.,The reason is unknown to all of us.,so
44853_1,Sam followed that statement with saying.,People think of those wearing hijabs as oppressed.,if
46159_1,I wanted to answer the best way I could.,My view point was most important.,and
43249_4,Atrocities committed by Christians are often overlooked.,The target is them currently is Muslims.,so
45107_3,His life would have changed.,He might have let anger corrupt him.,if
46127_2,We make judgments.,We have the opportunity to be open.,and
46362_1,"Seeing the black students talking about how it happened over 150 years ago,",why are you  talking about it?,and
45263_1,These people are mainly Christians.,They should take a second to look.,if
45562_1,I agree with the fact.,It is likely that I think this.,Nan
45206_5,He made the black people pretend to be white.,He had the white people pretend to be black.,and
44048_1,This point only adds to the slanted view.,Our view of other cultures in slanted.,Nan
43358_4,We would learn not to generalize people based on some piece of information.,We would think about situations on a case by case basis. ,because
43598_2,I could not even imagine the pain he had to go through., I could not even imagine the pain he is still going through.,and
46003_1,We have a misunderstanding of what the President does.,We automatically shift blame towards the President.,and
44227_2,That emphasizes evilness.,Many are far from that.,so
45622_6,"Myself, I will try to forgive those who might hurt me in the future. ",and live a peaceful life.,so
44192_4,We cannot pick one.,We cannot force it upon people.,and
42928_1,This is a huge issue.,I was raised to think everyone was equal.,and
46047_1,An example is how he does not like the government. ,It doesn't mean he still can't like the people of the country. ,Nan
45342_1,It shocked me.,Those ladies said they wear them because it makes them comfortable.,when
42974_4,They need to be brought to the surface for us.,There isn't enough time to spend as much time as we should on each one.,and
43313_3,We don't even care about their people.,The problem affects us directly.,if
42959_3,Basim respects Americans.,Basim does not hate the United States.,for
43664_1,They practice their religion peacefully.,But the world sees them as terrible people.,Nan
42916_2,The story may be true.,The story is missing details.,Nan
45702_2,I never thought they were a big deal.,They were not directly affecting me.,because
43062_2,The justice happened.,Sadam was executed.,when
43280_1,I truly do not believe how Basim could possibly forgive America.,"All of the horrible things our country's government has done to him, his family.",for
43793_1, Many people claim that this is disrespect.,It does raise the issue of what is considered right.,when
42780_2,I was shocked that he was willing to talk to us.,He shared his stories in a cam state.,and
45521_2,I feel like in the past few years it has been unfortunately a brought up topic.,It's how the media portrays it.,because
44670_1,I wondered how this could be.,He started to state his religion.,and
46044_2,He has decided to forgive.,It shows how strong of a person he is.,and
43579_1,The United States will not stop doing airstrikes., I do hope they are more careful.,and
43358_1,Whether we were trained to be more empathetic.,We would be more inclined to report only the facts of situations.,if
43244_1,I mean look at womens volleyball in the last Olympics,how many countries force their womens teams to run around in underwear and bras?,Nan
44115_1,I see the division in society among religious groups.,We have a tendency to instantly generalize those who aren't like us.,because
46319_1,having conversations that cause people to debate.,The issues that dominated our society will only help us come to resolution,and
43082_1,It was at this point in the lecture.,Basim addressed the entire class not a lot to give us advice. ,so
44290_1,It really makes you wonder., The troops made an impact over there to the point that it was all worth it.,if
44553_6,I wish they at least took into consideration families like Basom's.,"Like you said, these are real people's lives at stake.",and
42823_2,I thought about how Muslims in Iraq may be looking at Christians.,They might think we are all bad.,and
45244_1,There is hypocrisy of course on both sides.,A significant amount more coming from the critics in my opinion.,Nan
43178_2,Religion has such substantial influence on modern society.,Religion has substantial influence especially in America.,because
45697_1,Sometimes I find myself not forgiving people.,Basim's story about forgiving runs in my head.,and
44315_1,They have been fighting for many generations.,It is sad.,and
44192_1,It is true that our laws cannot be made to fit the Bible.,There are many religions here.,because
45206_1,"This week I decided to talk about the class that was titled ""Black Devils and Racial Supremacy.""","First, I understand why Sam wanted to switch roles.",for
44669_1,"Like you, I was very stunned.",Same told the class the situation with Basim.,when
44143_2,I honestly can't think of a more non-violent method of protest.,NFL players feel strongly about the subject.,for
46308_1,It makes sense to imagine.,Sometime later black people would go back to work at the plantations owned by whites.,Nan
43854_1,They have plenty of fame outside of the football field.,Why not band together?,and
46163_1,My favorite part of the class was in the video segment.,The final message was delivered.,Nan
45893_1,It was awesome.,My brother sat in on a class.,because
43170_1,Its not about the statistics.,The fact that you are tired of seeing them killed.,Nan
45078_3,It challenges your own believes.,It challenges your own opinions.,because
44234_2,So many Americans are being hypocrites.,They talk about Muslims in such a harsh light.,and
44674_6,Basim did not look to his religion for answers.,The man would be very different.,if
45640_3,In my personal opinions it is disgusting.,I can't believe this is not talked about more often.,and
46162_2,He told me to look.,Looking back it's at 4:38 second of this video.,and
45276_2,I saw proof of the white people peacefully protesting.,The black people rioted because of it.,and
44473_3,Government individuals who represent our country have a moral compass.,We all need to do better.,and
44210_1,That means everything that has happened in the past two decades.,"All the destruction in Iraq, was almost for no reason.",Nan
46193_7,Some aspects of the hijab are expressions of religious beliefs.,The hijab can be used to suppress personal freedom.,for
44613_1,Never has America seen a president so unique.,Never has America seen a president so polarizing.,and
42804_3,He has done a lot of good.,Many other police officers have suffered some consequences along the way.,so
44593_1,We do not realize the things that are happening around us.,We are very self-centered.,and
44747_2,People in the US should avoid thinking.,We as Americans are superior to the rest of the world.,Nan
46477_6,It was just a part of their life and a part of their culture.,but that they do not think one way is better than the other or that everyone should do what either group does.,Nan
46125_2,When looking at a Muslim woman wearing a hijab.,What does one think?,Nan
43221_3,There are many loopholes.,That can be discovered in their pages link.,because
44811_2,Over time he forgave.,He had to continue on with his life.,and
44340_3,Different media sources can restrain others.,They think it is better if the US people did not know.,if
46406_1,Blanketing all white people like this makes this a one-sided argument.,It doesn't bring understanding to either side.,and
45468_1,I was very shocked to see and hear from these women.,How they felt about wearing hijabs. ,for
45358_2,President trumps wishes to restrict with the hopes of preventing more acts of terrorism.,Even though 99.99% of Muslims do not support these terrorist organizations.,Nan
45493_2,They are required to have a high school diploma.,Pass a series of physical and mental tests.,and
45107_2,Anyone can imagine what could have happened.,His life would have changed.,if
42915_1,This is not to discredit the problems we have with racial bias' in our police force.,It is simply to question the coverage of these problems.,Nan
45367_2,Following that class I actually talked with my mom about the topic. ,I usually don't talk politics with her to much. ,because
43718_1,I just thought of it as an extracurricular activity.,One usually participates in it as a result of their parents' customs.,Nan
45587_1,Can you try to imagine what the end results would be?,Black students faced charges.,if
45932_4,You have your freedom.,You are being paid.,when
44815_3,This stuck out to me.,I thought that it is common in American.,for
44434_3,Sam went to go high-five the girl.,She refused.,and
44212_2,I can’t help to feel sad. ,I also feel responsible.,for
46229_7, its unfair that its required to wear them .,Its something I have thought about myself.,as
45278_1,Another thing that shocked me was the alarming statistics.,The alarming statistics had proven many crime rates drug deals etc.,Nan
45743_1,This segment foreshadows a wide awakening.,"They don't understand how big a deal the slave trade was in black history,",for
43929_1,It is imperative that we have conversations about these issues.,We need to come closer to ending the inequalities that we have.,and
43731_3,Sharia law is from the people.,many of the stereotypes about.,as
42820_1,I am a Christian.,Something baffles me.,and
43007_1,"Knowing myself, I also think that I would struggle to forgive.",I would struggle to move forward after such a tragedy.,and
46069_2,Life after slavery was worse for black people then life before slavery.,Life after slavery was worse for black people then life during slavery.,and
45876_2,Sometimes we should step back from the media.,It does a lot of the time show us.,because
45653_1,I thought it was interesting to hear.,The child belonged to a police officer.,Nan
45690_1,In 2017 we are having conversation about roles being reversed.,By 2050 the majority of this country will be mixed race.,because
45692_2,That can help inflict change. ,These tensions can grow. ,as
44764_3,It made them feel safer.,It made them more comfortable.,and
45020_3,They should basically just get over it,It happened in the past.,and
43394_1,I agree that Donald Trump should be focusing on other things.,More important things than what athletes are doing.,Nan
43816_1,Pick up the bible.,Read the Quran.,Nan
43686_2,"Just like this man, people are willing to move forward.",I think.,if
43846_1,What we can do is educate ourselves.,We listen.,and
44422_2,They perform a native song.,They sing of the gifts America came bearing for the natives.,and
43375_2,We just have to learn about the world from an unbiased perspective.,Which I think that Sam tries to do.,Nan
45265_2,People look different. ,They have different beliefs. ,because
43854_5,Why not band together?,"Why not do something more meaningful off of the field (such as starting charities, donating, being politically active or lobbying)?",so
43790_4,As you said they are mostly white people.,They are usually described in that way rather than a die-hard Christian.,because
43944_1,"Had he stayed angry with the US, I wouldn't have blamed him.",That would be a rational response to the situation.,because
44315_4,It is sad.,I  dont see the conflict ending any time soon.,as
45146_5,Hearing these women say they wear the clothes they do.,They essentially take pride in their religion ,so
43903_3,They need to understand the hardships they have there.,The other place is different from their own bubble of their country.,and
43233_6,the person just listened.the black,the person just listened.the black,if
45882_4,It took our preconceived notions about race.,It switched the skin colors.,and
46107_1,I  liked how the old pictures (of the white slaves picking cotton)used to reinforce this idea.,The wealthy black businessmen in New York City that started the slave trade.,and
45425_4,People with nonwhite names are discriminated against in white dominant areas.,People with nonwhite names endure job discrimination.,when
43363_6,People who associate with the Taliban aren't Muslim.,or ISIS aren't Muslim.,Nan
45021_3,Especially towards this topic. ,The way they reacted to whites people was switched. ,when
46219_3,The three people presented in their own rhetoric.,The presentation showed me the BLM movement is a product of history.,so
46310_3,They pretty much set the rules.,They controlled the outcome.,so
45014_2,It's time we start looking deeper into things.,We start looking deeper into things to prevent us from going into even more confusion and violence.,and
46395_2,It was still a new experience for me.,To be hearing everything that happened as if it happened to my people.,Nan
44606_1,That raises the question of protesting being right.,That raises the question of protesting not being right.,and
44505_2,They did not have this problem up until 2003.,America came in.,when
45568_2,The fact is no surprise to these people.,They know.,because
43500_5,The have never learned about Puerto Rico in high school.,They have never been exposed to Puerto Rico.,because
42935_1,I think it helped him a lot.,he lived within America.,and
45831_5,His strength is inspiring.,I hope that he will be able to share his story with more Americans.,so
45754_4,all of these bad things are happening to these innocent people,I asked myself why am I going on with my life so selfishly.,if
45666_3,It isn't healthy to hold onto anger  long.,my entire reason why i am living is  my family.,so
44922_1,I agree that it is sad to hear that other countries are more aware than the United States.,I think that is something we need to work on.,Nan
46002_1,Our country is divided with the two parties among the three branches of government.,Many of us don't realize that the president has to fight his own people before executing any sort of meaningful action.,so
46370_1,Black people are facing racism.,We need to realize racism is an issue.,and
43286_4,My dad knows everything about its history.,My dad know everything about the geography of the world.,and
44991_5,More people should do what Sam did.,They should take the time to look over the history of what happened.,and
45466_4,"The tradition of discrimination America was founded on, is deeply rooted into the government and social mindsets.",People thought it was socially normal to have different schools and different bathrooms for an entire race of people.,so
42853_1,This talk was awe-inducing .,"In England, many people were aware of what was occurring in the Middle East. ",because

43747_2,We can learn many things from the international students.,We truly broaden our view on the world.,and
45487_2,It was from the side of the black students.,You could hear the emotion in their voice.,because

43186_3,It would allow us to be more knowledgeable of what is happening outside this country.,It would allow us to be more aware of what is happening outside this country.,and
45146_2,They are forced to rather than them wanting to,Hearing these women say they wear the clothes they do.,because
43798_1,American citizens often do not think about other countries.,American citizens often do not think about citizens that populate other countries.,and
44702_2,"If I were black, I would want the world to learn about my specific racial groups history.",It was intense.,because

45318_1,Things need to change.,Blaming anyone at this point will not solve a thing.,Nan
44744_1,It is easy to find out information.,It's on the tip of our fingertips.,and
43790_2,You truly do not hear as much at all about Christians doing anything horrible.,As you said they are mostly white people.,because

44256_3,Bassim isn't a teacher by profession,He is a teacher by his actions,and

43104_2,He has moved on with those feelings.,He has continued living his life.,and
43297_1,This lecture was intriguing.,Sam flipped the script on history.,because
46367_5,I hope that many people don't just look past those photos.,how long ago did it happened?,because

46345_3,Not only would they use these unjustified reason to kill other.,Without even giving them a chance to a fair trial.,Nan

46374_3,We overlook black history.,American history is more important than black history.,as
46184_1,"Sam talked about laws women must abide, one was they could not be ""sexual"" with their eyes.","My thought is, they only have eyes showing anyway, should they keep their eyes closed?",when
46247_2,You said that you believe that the idea of women being oppressed probably comes from an earlier time period.,Not today. ,and
46273_6,The United States was founded by white men., it has been structured ever since it's discovery to keep white men in power.,and

44036_2,I thought. ,"I said things like, ""Why is this happening to me?""",and

46371_2,Some people saw an attack.,The attack was on white people.,as
45111_3,The police are supposed to be the good guys.,It's really hard to hear that they are brutally beating innocent people.,so

44118_1,I wish high schools had the permission to talk more about religion.,"Not being able to discuss religion, at a younger age especially makes us ignorant.",because
44765_1,I consider myself a feminist.,The dialogue made me more conscious of ideas about hijabs that Id had.,and
44151_4,"When we do, there is much talk of improvement and how things will get better",I feel this proves change isn’t easy. ,so
45210_1,I do think it is interesting.,The Black unemployment rate his higher.,for
45145_1,That was not the case.,Sam pushed do not be politically correct.,and
43530_1,I agree with you when you brought up American history in class.,We are only taught about certain things in school.,Nan

43396_1,It was on another topic from class.,It raised a lot of awareness.,Nan
43665_3,That the media coverage of the Middle East is negative.,That the good in all Muslims is never shown to the average Americans.,and
45377_4,It is never seen as disrespectful,It is never shunned on national news.,and
44812_1,One lost family members in a bombing incident.,It would be very hard to let go of all the anger.,if

44003_1,We hear from the news.,We hear from the interent.,Nan
43186_4,It would allow us to be more knowledgeable of what is happening outside this country.,It would allow us to be more aware of what is happening outside this country.,and
46454_2,What I learned from this lecture is to be curious and open-minded.,Cultures are different than mine.,Nan
42863_1,Sometimes it is easier for people to ignore their problems. ,Sometimes it is easier for people to hold grudges. ,and

45011_3,"It's all over twitter, Facebook, the news.",We've been seeing many instances where police brutality has become really bad.,so
43099_1, several of America's actions does not affect me directly.,I often feel angry about how the country can treat its own citizens,Nan
43897_1,It's when we find our own voice.,It's when we created our own thoughts.,and
45070_1,We are meant to believe that what we are doing in the MIddle East is helping.,We believe it is necessary for us to be there.,and
43230_4,"He calls them names, especially illegal immigrants,",as if his ancestors came here legally.,and
44914_1,Some people have the wrong impressions.,Black people say black lives matter.,when
44826_1,"The lives of many Iraqi citizens, such as Basim, were also changed forever.",The bombings caused this.,because
45654_3,Many people were killed by police.,Many people were categorized by race.,and
43409_2,We make ourselves the heroes. ,Aren't we bad like the terrorists?,as
44773_3,"At the end of the day, white people wont.",Most white people see no benefits.,because
43464_1,I don't think it should be that hard. ,A government such powerful like ours. ,as
46213_2,Your possibility for employment should be based on your social skills.,"Your possibility for employment should be based on your level of professionalism, NOT your skin color, or your name!",and
44730_2,I wasn't surprised I heard this.,It was refreshing to hear Islam is a forgiving religion.,when
43988_3,It is just put into our heads.,It is a battlefield.,and
45711_1,More people need to hear about this to understand that things like this are happening around the world,The government should be held accountable when something like this happens.,so
45956_4,we have white people hear them say things that sound insane to us,They are really thing black people have heard about themselves throughout history.,and
43504_5,It is so easy to assume things about people who look different.,You notice what is different about each other first.,because

43665_2,You can't help to feel bad.,That the media coverage of the Middle East is negative.,so
44041_3,The media have somehow developed the power to choose what gets to be talked about.,The media have somehow developed the power to choose what's not talked about.,and
44626_3,It would really open eyes on a lot of issues.,That is what I was hoping for.,and
45785_1,I value this class so much.,We get to hear stories.,and
43078_1,Today’s governments are just vicious cycles.,They hurt people’s lives with egotistic and ambitious ideals.,Nan
43967_1,Is he making a stand?,He believes.,for
44379_1,I agree a lot with what you said.,I agree about how impressive it is that he was able to move on.,and
44758_1,It is their prerogative.,They did not slut shame them.,as
44991_3,The video was mostly just explaining the history.,More people should do what Sam did.,if
43492_1,Sometimes I wonder whose fault this situation is.,Iraq forcing our hand to get involved.,for
43995_2,We all need to stop seeing them like they are residents of a battlefield.,We should see them like the families they are.,as
45119_3,People want you to think that more black people are being killed by police officers.,It is the opposite.,because
44362_1,The Westborough Baptist Church gets on the news.,The radical Muslims get on the news.,so
46500_1,The toll it takes on a population to live that history is brutal enough.,To know it doesnt even get acknowledged is unimaginable to deal with.,Nan
46284_1,The media is to blame for a large amount of the racial polarization of this country.,That is something I firmly believe in.,and
44240_1,We are confused how Basil forgave these people. ,Try and speak to the Americans as if we didn’t destroy his life. ,as

43733_2,The Quran is only so many pages.,It can be interpreted in many ways.,and
44956_5,"Sitting in discussion, I understood why many chose not to.",I felt the same with November 7th growing near.,as

43657_4,"Eventually, the whole world start seeing these. ",The kids grow up seeing this only makes the situation worst.,and
45326_3,The American President made no difference to Basim.,The American Presidents continued the same agenda.,because
46405_9,t flipped like in the lecture to reduce confusion.,"throughout the lecture they kept portraying all whites like bigoted, selfish, greedy, had no regard to any other human that was not white.",and
44540_1,I was never taught any of the things we discussed about in class in high school before.,This is very new knowledge to me.,so
45956_1,I think their hesitance was also important,it gave the race that was silenced for so long a chance to hold the upper hand in a conversation,because
44531_1,Everyone should be educated this way,We would advance in every area. ,if
46180_1,I am wondering why people thing it is sexist to wear a hijab.,A woman chooses to wear it.,if

43437_2,He state that he felt blessed to be alive.,He was in the same situation that killed his wife and daughter.,when
44226_5,We villainize the Muslim population.,It is a few thousand.,because
46306_4,Many post civil war decisions were made by white people.,The decisions made by white people benefit those in control.,if
45955_1,I think they felt strange acting the pain of centuries of oppression.,They have never felt it.,as
43023_2,We know that KKK members aren't Christians.,We shouldn't assume that the people killing people in the Middle East aren't Muslims.,so
46402_4,I feel we should all at least have basic empathy for all individuals.,Regardless of how different they are from us.,as
45706_2,We found it difficult to comprehend the role reversal at first,in the end it definitely was an enlightening way to look at our history.,and
45733_2,His strength is inspiring.,I will never forget the story he shared with the class.,and
45870_1,Sam went quickly to the question of why would people believe the police officer over the civilian.,One of the answers was that the police felt threatened by the individual who was resisting arrest.,and
43531_4,I personally think it is because people are afraid of the truth,they don't know how to find a solution.,because
43606_1,We have the opportunity right at our fingertips here at Penn State to take classes to inform us about these things., it is important that we take advantage of these opportunities in order to understand other people and cultures.,Nan
45618_6,To forgive his enemies there is no other way that will benefit not only him,to forgive his enemies there is no other way that will benefit others.,and

43097_1,it make feel good.,It really makes me wonder though.,as
42953_1,This class has helped me become more aware.,This class has made me curious to do extra research about what is going on around me.,and
43631_4,"The times they do talk about other countries, the story will be a small headline.","The times they do talk about other countries, the story will be a brief article.",if
45046_7,There is the sense of racism.," and in some instances, this caters to white people in the real world.",because
44877_3,Two out of every three slaves died.,Slaves are being transported from Africa across the Atlantic.,when
43502_2,it is just a matter of spreading the word.,it is just a matter of focusing on all the topics that should be talked about in order to progress as a society.,and

44580_4,I'm an American.,The last three Presidents are catastrphically different from one another in many different facets.,as
43300_3,This doesn't mean that civil society accepted this movement.,This doesn't mean black people were accommodated.,and
46197_2,I believe we human beings we have the right to absolute freedom.,We complete autonomy in regards to personal decisions. ,as
46164_1,I agree with you.,Racism will never end.,when

43480_1,All my schools were similar.,They taught the same thing.,and
44158_4,They claim to know what to do. ,It’s really harder than it seems. ,when
42864_1,"If Basim was able to confront his past and move on to a brighter and better future, it is possible for us all to let go of our past.",It would be possible for us to focus on what matters.,and
46039_2,It would help all people realized the stereotypes.,People have stereotypes about certain groups of people.,Nan
43636_3,Miss out on advantageous relationships with foreign nations.,We choose not to learn about them.,because
43380_4,This should never happen,it ends in the loss of a life.,if
46068_2,Sam said in the video.,White people set things up.,so
44152_2,Americans often have a lot of pride towards our leaders. ,Americans feel pride toward our country .,and
44926_2,We are able to see past the stereotypes.,We look at people for how they truly are.,and

44998_1,We live in a mostly Christian nation.,We are biased towards thinking that Christianity does not have the same radical following.,because
45447_1,We do have every right to get upset.,We get upset when someone we don't like gets elected.,Nan
46174_2,it was interesting to see their perspective about wearing it.,One of them saying that it gives you a different perspective because your not worried about yourself and able to look out in the world without so much worry.,and

45618_1,"Moreover, he himself know that he can not revenge.",That will only cause more tragedies happen.,because
44889_4,It has always been somewhat boring to me.,It is bad like it sounds.,as
45225_1,The media portrays the world as such a hostile place.,It is not in the United States.,so
44997_2,It is almost an identical situation.,The only difference being religion.,Nan
45650_4,The black people were just dodging their questions.,The black people were turning the question back on the white people.,and
45754_2,This lecture also made me look at myself.,all of these bad things are happening to these innocent people,if
46485_3,It is hard to pity someone.,You have no idea what kind of person they are.,if
46072_1,Plantations were messed up.,Destructive physical harm took place on plantations.,so
45320_1,"Now, that grabbed my attention fast.","I was just scanning post's, there it was. ",when

42878_1,Erin said.,Everyone in the world knows what actually is going on.,and
43875_2,"They have their own newspaper, host rallies, and hate people who are not white.","They stand for far right political practices, and want to be the dominate race.",Nan
43452_2,Christianity and Islam are the two largest religions in the world.,They share a lot of historical and traditional connections.,as
43167_4,The system will work in their favor.,Compared to blacks who feel the exact opposite.,and
42928_3,I never thought of any religion as mine.,I had an open mind.,so
45263_2,They should take a second to look.,They should take a second to see the majority of Muslims are just like us.,and
45147_2,I thought that this was something that they wore all the time.,I did not know.,because
43999_1,In case you are taking drastic steps you need to ensure that you realize the depth of the issue.,In case you are taking drastic steps you need to be aware of the entire situation.,and
45799_2,we hear Muslims killing Muslims.,we judge their culture from afar.,and
45593_1,I truly felt the class really listening to the song.,I truly felt the class was respecting the song.,and
43204_2,Did an officer actually think it was real?,Did an officer actually think their life might have been in danger?,and
46206_1,We can continue to live in oblivion.,We can continue to ignore important topics.,and
43757_5,We judge their situation without thinking once.,"We do not ask ourselves, why?",and
42798_1,Bosum talked about his Christian friend.,His friend was unable to return to Mosul. ,Nan
46127_5,We have the opportunity to be open.,We answer the questions people are asking.,and
44036_1,I put myself in his shoes for a second.,I thought. ,and
45001_1,People are afraid of Muslims due to their religion. ,They should also be afraid of Christians. ,because
45449_1,Those things were not in danger.,Things were not in danger during Obama's time in office.,when
44932_1,We were able to profit off of their oil.,I agree with the above comment.,and
45679_2,Some people weren't sitting directly up front.,The message was loud.,if
44188_1,I think it’s due to Christianity being the norm in the US. ,It’s what the majority of the country practices. ,and
43435_1,The way the government of the United States handled the situation was poor.,The way the government of the United States handled the situation was disgusting.,and
43768_2,His whole family is from there. ,He lived a quiet life. ,and
44160_1,I believe.,The statistics are vastly different than what we think.,Nan

44755_2,They personally are not judging them.,They're alone or among other women.,and
44768_1,The blacks were so quick to defend the officer.,They see him as one of their people.,because
45452_1,That doesn't make me proud to be American.,It makes me more mad.,and
43100_4,I feel personally victimized.,I feel personally excluded.,and
45336_4,They were from my grandmother.,who was in the Navy.,and
44398_4,The internet makes people believe that thousands of unarmed black people are killed by cops every year.,This in not the case.,and
43403_1,His story actually touched my heart.,I was extremely sorry to hear about what happened to his home.,Nan
44753_6,Many people thought they were totally different.,They really weren't.,and
45380_6,There are better ways to show your opinions.,There are more appropriate ways to show your opinions.,because
43170_3,Seeing them attacked at all.,Particularly without any repercussions from their assailant. ,and
44629_2,It is hard to be raised as something.,It is hard to feel so confused about it.,because
43169_1,"Just like Sam mentioned, there reaches a point.",You are tired of seeing the videos.,Nan
44843_3,We should be taking interest in how they are living.,It is highly possible that there are many things we can do to help.,and
46348_1,I think that many people fail to have compassion.,Something has actually affected them.,Nan
45997_1,You bring up a very good point about what life would be like the roles actually were reversed?, I think its a very difficult question to answer.,if
45282_6,The case worker is racially biased a lot of the time.,The case worker believes there is more trouble at home than there actually is.,because
44839_1,Now this is not infallible.,It is the job of a jury to remain impartial.,Nan
43957_4,it is only up to us to find those stories.,it is only up to us to inform ourselves on what is going on in the world we live in.,and
43784_1,I completely agree that we tend to always see others as less than what we are.,We tend to pick out other people's flaws a lot more than the ones we have.,and
45376_1,The U.S. should be taking care of its own people.,We are focused on something that won't result in death.,when
43040_1,Of course 9 11 was extremely tragic.,It still doesn't justify.,Nan
45289_1,Undoubtedly the cost of war outweighs the benefits gained by the winning side.,"If we could fully realize the damages of war, would we ever go to war in the first place?",so
44877_2,Sam talked.,Two out of every three slaves died.,when
46273_2,It is hard.,It is frustrating.,and
43367_3,In place of all the amazing charitable things that Christians have done.,I can imagine that many Muslims feel the same way. ,and
45405_1,The man was beaten .,He was resisting is pathetic.,for
45462_1,"I felt that many white people in the audience were uncomfortable, including me.",We were combated with our own racism that has gone on far too long.,for

44450_3,We need to become more culturally aware of other unrest.,We continue to turn a blind eye.,if

45017_6,They talk about their ancestors.,They talk about what happened in the past with slavery.,and
44980_3,Don't take everything to heart.,What is the worst thing that can happen?,and

46295_4,I won't if it is really hot out.,I don't have to think about whether people are looking at my scar.,because
44477_3,White people are often ignorant.,We have a history of oppressing them.,because
42779_2,Our country has effects on people.,It is important for us to be aware of what is going on.,and
43944_3,That would be a rational response to the situation.,Basim is truly an extraordinary person.,because
45520_7,Some people think that it is talked about too much.,others think not enough.,and
44076_2,Half the population believes one thing,The other half believes something else.,if
46134_1,Sam is doing this demonstration.,Caucasians can better relate to the African American community.,Nan
46024_1,Society needs to get a grip on what issues are truly important.,Society needs to get a grip on what issues can get less attention in the media.,and
44869_1,Those black students were up there representing me.,They were representing people I know.,and
45117_2,It's crazy to me.,It seemed like the entire class was pretty shocked to see these statistics.,because
45839_2,We must take a step back.,We must understand a different person's perspective.,and
45532_3,It's our nation's history.,We should all be aware of it.,and
46170_1,"Yes, to the people who asked me, I got them with me in class.",I dont happen to walk around with a bunch of scarfs in my bag.,for
42876_3,The actions of people should be judged by that person.,The actions of people shouldn't be judged by the belief they share with others.,and
45701_3,I was quick to judge.,I had my own privelage.,so
44696_2,It seems really crazy to me.,It is a clear example of how white people are erasing major components of black history.,because
44601_1,It is intriguing to see now.,No one knows how long the protest will continue to go.,because
46407_1,Minorities do have it harder than whites.,There are thousands of statistics to back that up.,Nan
44253_1,He has taught himself to forgive.,He is a Muslim.,as
45734_1,One third of the country is full of racist bigots.,One third is full of people who want equality.,and
46336_2,I am happy that trips like the one Mark Evans pitched exist.,Others can enjoy them along with learn from them.,and
44075_1,Its so open to interpretation.,That it would actually cause more chaos than anything else.,because
43453_1,They both worship the same God.,The bible and Quran are very similar.,for
43780_1,I believe this to be truthful.,I do not necessarily believe we can take away their faith.,Nan
45144_3,The women might think they were being mean.,The truth they spoke might be mean.,if
43437_1,Bassim inspired me.,He state that he felt blessed to be alive.,when
46022_4,The natural disasters happen in other countries.,The focus of the media attracts a bigger audience.,because
44171_1,It is a vital part of our promising future.,It is a vital we understand the importance of global awareness.,Nan
43741_6,He was able to see past our military.,Every American was not responsible for what happened to his family.,because
44060_1,I think that to have true empathy you have to step outside of yourself.,To have empathy you have to put yourself in someone else's shoes.,and
45761_1,I found it very emotional.,Sam pointed out that.,when
44663_1,I thought it was cool.,He flipped all the statistics around.,Nan
44092_1,We know that obviously no matter who's in office nothing gets done over there.,Bassim believes that the US should just back out of Iraq Afghanistan all together.,so
43421_2,He has been through so much hurt in his life.,He is able to smile.,and
46245_4,I had many unanswered questions. ,It was very interesting listening to the girls perspectives on it.,so
44298_1,Most people would hold much resentment.,Most people would want to demonize America.,and
45140_4,To find opportunity.,To find shelter. ,as
42960_3,"He came out on top, optimistic.",He is not filled with anger.,and
43990_1,You think of Iraq in the sense of the pictures being shown in class.,It is just a normal city being destroyed by hate.,when
46086_3,It's for not checking in with their superiors.,It's when they are out late at night.,if
46357_2,you are thinking about the lives of other people in places.,you may not even like those places.,when
46156_1,All he said was that it was going to be great.,He asked me to get a couple of scarfs.,and
42913_1,I think it is important to highlight wrongdoing by our officers.,I don't understand why the media inflates the issues.,Nan
45601_3,There is still a problem with racism in the criminal justice system.,There are plenty of videos.,and
44119_3,They should just keep student's minds open.,Tere is not one right religion.,and
45021_4,Especially towards this topic. ,The way they reacted to whites people was switched. ,when
43597_4,He tells us what the United States government did to Basim.,He tells us what it did to his family,and
46419_3,Do you believe that White people should feel ashamed?,Do you believe that they should pay for their ancestors' mistakes?,if
43550_4,I think there should be an effort to add more classes like these.,They should at least make an effort to talk about it in some other classes.,so
45000_1,A majority of Islams following have no association at all to terrorist organizations.,They are normal people.,and
44818_4,Everyone would have known.,Maybe even the government would get involved.,and
43277_1,I believe this class would mitigate racial conflicts.,It would mitigate ethnic conflicts.,and
42874_1,That is why it is important to not judge the actions of a few Muslims.,They say they are Muslims.,because
44178_1,Something like that happened to my family.,Something like that happened to me.,and
43767_2,we should look forwards and at the good in our lives that we have.,"we should cherish, not forget, the ones we have lost.",and
43310_7,We tend to turn towards the media.,It helps educate us on these topics.,Nan
43079_1,I hope people realize this.,Work along each other to make a change. ,and
43212_1,"It's crazy to think that people believe such a small book has enough information and detail in it to form a coherent, functioning society.",The Bible or the Quran are examples of small books like that.,and
46491_1,I am able to trace my lineage. ,I celebrate traditions that are hundreds of years old with my family. ,and
46001_5,He does have quite a lot of power.,He has influence under his belt.,and
44039_1,A number of terrorist attacks have happened over the last few years.,People assume that every single one is done by Muslims.,and
44871_1,I think race is a topic that people tend to ignore.,it is a sensitive topic.,because
44384_1,Sam talks about his Ted Talk.,He met Basim through Basims response to the Ted Talk.,and
43081_3,They need aid from people that will help them build their lives how they want to in order for them to be in peace. ,Everyone wants to have normal lives.,and
44370_1,I do not feel comfortable calling them extremists. ,It’s not how they define themselves. ,as
44627_1,The main idea was to see things from different perspectives.,I wanted to get out of this class.,and
46175_2,"He told me to look, thus looking back it now at 4:38 second of this video,",the synchronization is quite funny,and
46260_2,Racial inequality is a huge issue today.,Our country does not get the recognition that it needs.,and
43737_3,It ismale-dominated but not completely.,Woman in the culture have rights.,and
46450_1,This particular comment is interesting.,I automatically would've assumed.,because
45200_3,Thats how wars were done back then,Blame white people for that. ,and
45834_4,I'm being completely honest.,I was shocked to see more Caucasian people have been killed by the police than African Americans.,if
43324_1,It's just sad how quick we are to judge others.,When others judge us we put up a fight.,Nan
43382_3,"Being a white woman, I don't understand that fear in relation to the police/police brutality.","It is tragic, the extent of people who have to experience it.",so
46216_2,Sam said that this was not a class to miss.,The mystery of why had me wondering up until class.,and
44063_5,I was never really taught about it.,I never really was taught to care much about it.,and
44302_1,I completely agree with you., Rage will  hurt you.,when
46120_2,I remember the way I felt.,The empathy in that room was very real.,Nan
43023_1,We know that KKK members aren't Christians.,We shouldn't assume that the people killing people in the Middle East aren't Muslims.,and
44759_3,Sam's attempt at getting them to not answer politically correct seemed like he wanted them to say that the girls do look unclean due to their clothing.,They didn't do that.,because
45066_1,I think it is amazing that he is able to live life everyday.,He lived with the descendants of the people who committed genocide on his people.,Nan
43974_1,I have never really thought about the violence between Christians as being generally the same as the violence between Muslims.,I completely understand the point that Sam is trying to make.,Nan
45908_4,A couple of girls in class came up wearing hijabs.,The girls wearing hijabs talked about their hijabs.,when
44110_2,We do have to talk about the bad things going on.,We do need to stay informed on the bad things going on.,and
46188_2,Your definition was a great way to describe what this movement is.,The black lives matter movement helped a white man's family.,when
46179_2,To understand from women who do wear hijabs that they do it for themselves.,They want to wear it.,and
43084_1,Geography and world history are often overlooked.,The American education system is concerned.,when
45257_3,We can make people understand.,We can make people become better.,and
43557_4,It leads to people not caring about the events.,It's not happening in America.,because
44881_1,Someone were to talk about how a black person makes less money than a white person.,They would be told that a black person needs to work harder.,Nan
42819_1,He did open my eyes.,I may judge other religions.,and
43919_2,They have different views.,They implement very different laws that affect the American people.,and
45736_4,Dr. Richards displayed it back to the class in a unique manner.,Dr. Richards made everyone question the intensity of the events occurring,and
46090_1,I was inspried.,The first few months I was numb.,when
45902_3,Myself included.,We act as if we do.,and
43286_3,My dad went to school in Poland.,My dad knows everything about its history.,and
46006_1,I thought it was interesting.,I saw the two competing perspectives in a different way than usual.,so
43781_1,There is a reason I believe this.,There are past conversations we have had in class.,because
45785_4,We get to hear stories.,We don't just read out of a textbook.,because
46385_4,Blacks are peacefully protesting for their basic rights.,whites starting the unnecessary violence.,and
45973_3,They had to sign a contract.,This contract made black people not able to do things freely.,and
44713_2,His whole world was falling apart.,He has learned to deal with the pain of this.,and
43396_3,Sam put up the statistics.,It showed more white people are shot by police.,and
43439_1,"If he remained angry, he would not have been able tell his story to educate others.",He would not have been able to help to prevent this for others in the future.,and
43735_1,A spouse abandons the other.,This is the period of time to assume their property is shorter in Afghanistan.,when
46262_3,It's hard for students who have no real knowledge of this issue to understand how important it is to talk about these types of things.,It just bothers me that we were given this opportunity to see what racial inequality was and is like.,so
43646_1,There is much we do not know about.,There are places like Iraq.,so
44652_1,People are raised differently.,They are raised in all settings.,and
45255_2,they seemed even worse than they already did after all of the facts.,they seemed even worse than they already did after all of the terrible events have been presented. ,and
43327_2,he lets Islam guide his life so.,his life so.,and
46294_1,I have a pretty noticeable scar on the inside of my right elbow. ,I am proud of that scar.,and
43375_1,In order to make ourselves more empathetic.,We just have to learn about the world from an unbiased perspective.,Nan
46331_1,It was impressive to learn about the expeditions Mark Evans had gone on.,We learned the life lessons he had learned from them.,and
44223_1,Sam was able to reverse the roles.,Sam was able to put us in the shoes of Basim.,and
45887_2,The three white people at the front of class understood the black's side.,The white people got upset that the black people did not care to listen.,when
45790_1,This was to weed out those that had privilege.,People were told to watch one another.,Nan
43332_1,No one should ever have to go through such a huge loss in his family.,It was a bombing by the American government that went awry.,and
45466_2,It really showed how ignorant actual white people were during the Civil Rights movement.,"The tradition of discrimination America was founded on, is deeply rooted into the government and social mindsets.",so
43564_2,The city has ended up being now.,I was amazed by Bassim Razzos optimism.,and
45182_3,"Trying to play opposite roles, the students took turns trying to talk about their history.","At first, I think they found it hard to get into character.",as
43322_5,We call their ideas weird.,We call their ideas backwards.,and
43902_1,I am interested in what is happening in places that I hear about on the news.,I know nothing about them.,Nan
44578_3,I expected Basim to say that he preferred the diplomatic Obama over Trumps rough personality.,I expected Basim to say that he preferred the more mild mannered Obama over Trump's harsh rhetoric.,and
43934_2,They are directly trying to disrespect veterans.,Our flag has more meanings than just military.,because
45435_3,"One girl made a lighthearted comment about not having to worry about her hair.,",All 5 of the hijab wearing women laughed.,and
44282_1,However I agree with her.,Not all police officers should be generalized in a negative light.,Nan
44787_3,Everyone should try to think about the struggles.,He's gone through.,Nan
46228_1,I like that the five girls were willing to come up and talk about their own experiences with wearing this article of clothing.,Its safe to say that Hijabs can present a bad connotation for those who dont understand their purpose.,because
43854_3,Why not band together?,"Why not do something more meaningful off of the field (such as starting charities, donating, being politically active or lobbying)?",and
43812_5,Why are muslims generalized to be violent?,Why are muslims generalized to be sexist?,and
43159_3,Crazies who make their own interpretation.,Crazies who use it to excuse violence.,and
44843_4,We should be taking interest in how they are living.,It is highly possible that there are many things we can do to help.,because
44424_2,I'll admit to cracking a smirk.,It is something I have never heard.,Nan
46461_4,Female breasts are more sexualized than male breasts.,Female breasts need to be covered.,and
43382_7,"I think it needs to change, 100%.",It needs to change soon.,and
44396_3,Videos of black people being discriminated is very publicized in today's media.,Videos of black people being killed by police is very publicized in today's media.,because
45087_3,Women are called names.,Men do the same thing.,when
46459_2,it is considered public nudity.,"In most places a crime a woman to expose her breast in public , men can do so.",and
45808_3,you havent visited their land or just talked to any 5 Muslims in America to see that that stereotype simply isnt true.,they are very peaceful individuals.,when
44961_4,I heard how ridiculous some of the arguments from whites are. ,I also head arguments from black people. ,as
43009_3,His religion encourages forgiveness.,He did it.,so
45229_1,This class has been extremely beneficial.,It has helped open up our perspective to view the world outside our own.,Nan
43430_1,Think about the constitution.,Think about how all men are created equal.,and
46059_2,He swore to protect people.,He swore to see out the law.,Nan
44864_3,I know about oppression.,I think about it mainly as history.,and
45195_1,Take what you learn.,"Try to use it to make some sort of impact, no matter how small.",and
45145_2,Sam pushed do not be politically correct.,There was nothing negative said from either group (Muslim women or American women).,and
44033_2,It's something embarrassing that we did.,It is an act that can be easily brushed under the rug.,and
42810_2,The posts are about how police are shooting unarmed black people all the time,They are getting away with it.,and
43846_2,What we can do is educate ourselves.,We listen.,and
43434_1,Some things are irreplaceable.,Some things do not have a monetary value.,and
43494_1,My hopes are that President Trump will be able to manage this ongoing situation in the Middle East.,both parties can heal and grow from what has been an ugly period of war.,so
45079_3,You look at yourself.,Others would look at you.,and
45141_1,I agree that we have to be able to have empathy to one another.," we all different upbringing , we all go through different trials.",and
46052_1,I'm saying.,Policemen should be held accountable too.,Nan
43061_1,Imagine that we send them clothes and gifts.,After Sadam and ISIS destroyed all their wealth they cannot afford many necessities.,because
43308_2,very like, yes we talked.,Nan
45471_2,who always understood that there was a sexist connotation around the idea of wearing hijabs.,for these women it was freeing for them.,Nan
43564_3,The city has ended up being now.,I was amazed by Bassim Razzos optimism.,as
44251_1,"Furthermore, he is mature enough.",He sees that not every American is like the people that took his family.,Nan
43105_1,I guess.,what I'm trying to say is that America is a country with a lot of great opportunities.,Nan
43794_2,Sitting is considered disrespectful. ,Why is printing on plates not considered disrespectful?,if
46203_1,People tend to want to cover up.,Negative history has occurred in America.,and
46270_1,The statistics show the difference.,Change is needed.,and
42781_1,He started talking about his religion.,He pointed out that he would not let anger eat him alive. ,and
45418_3,Just one person in my family died from something so tragic I would not be able to cope for the longest time.,"All I would be able to think would be, Why couldnt it be me?",and
43362_3,There are many Christians who consider themselves neo-Nazis.,We think about that.,as
44623_3,Naturally it doesn't even make sense.,You can find plenty of white people just as tall as black people.,because
45304_3,The cop was doing a white person's job.,I have never experienced these issues first hand.,and
44578_2,I expected Basim to say that he preferred the diplomatic Obama over Trumps harsh rhetoric.,I expected Basim to say that he preferred the diplomatic Obama over Trumps rough personality.,and
43977_1,I found it really surprising in this video.,Sam mentioned that this tolerance was being tested.,when
43181_1,"Being aware and knowing what is going on abroad, where our government is getting involved.","putting money and resources, is  important.",so
44580_5,I'm an American.,The last three Presidents are catastrphically different from one another in many different facets.,because

45259_1, I thought about how narrow minded this frame of mind is., it promotes the lack of education of other societys.,and
45141_6," we all different upbringing , we all go through different trials.",Tribulations  that's why we should be more open to the world.,and

45950_1,"For example, a white kid probably never would have felt comfortable taking on the roll of a slave owner.",A white kid probably never would have felt comfortable saying something.,and
43019_3,It influenced my negative view of this place,Now I see the place differently.,Nan
44292_1,The average American thinks we significantly helped the Middle East.,They think we made everything much better.,and
43770_2,the governmen.,There is corruption in,for

45007_3,I know that players have the ability to make a difference.,They make people angry.,and
45162_1,I went up to the Muslim students.,I asked if I could wear a hijab.,and
45431_6,"They approached it casually, like a Penn State student would.",They explained why they wear blue and white to a football game.,as
43553_4,It is important that we try to educate people more on what is going on.,It's about why they should care.,and
43832_5,Blaming a whole populace is not healthy., I respect him even more for this.,and
45305_1,"I have had conversations with many different people about this, and other similar issues.",Again and again I find it hard to understand the other side.,Nan
46294_6,I am not embarrassed or ashamed of it.,It is still kind of distracting to me when I am around new people.,and
44699_5,This class has really changed that.,I have learned how to empathize more with people I cannot relate to.,as
43294_1,He told us we are definitely being censored from information,It is due to how main stream media reports the news,for
42897_1,I have never really thought about the civilians in the Middle East.,I have never thought about what they have to deal with every day.,and
45340_1,It flies every day as a symbol of the country we live in even though it carries our nation's faults.,it carries our countries greatest accomplishments.,and
44245_4,I don't know.,I  would have been so quick to forgive.,if
43480_2,They taught the same thing.,I am Christian.,and
43310_3,There is a lack of formal education on current polotical issues.,There's a lack of formal education on foreign countries.,as
44828_1,The decision was obviously extremely important at the time.,It wasn't worth the damage and loss of life caused.,Nan
43224_2,A certain thing is shown to us in great detail.,We are only shown what happens in our country.,Nan
45944_1,Statistics about historically unjustified killings should be displayed.,I believe that the statistic would be higher for black people versus white people.,if
43786_2,They create a more closed-off view of other races.,They create a more closed-off view of other cultures.,and
45879_3,It can be hard to have.,It allows a different perspective.,for
43339_1,I should've thought.,How could a country ever go back to the way it was?,Nan
43131_1,I can see people not agreeing with this.,Not everyone HAS to agree with this. ,because
46080_1,at some pointed I was confused doing the lecture.,I believe it was eye opening.,Nan
43699_2,We need to go through personal growth.,Personal growth isn't the job of our parents.,and
42834_2,This whole class is about challenging our minds to step outside of the preconditioned generalizations we have about other cultures.,This whole class is about changing our perspectives.,and
43204_1,Did an officer see that toy gun?,Did an officer actually think it was real?,and
43563_1,Mosul is a city a lot of people do not know about.,Many people forget what people in these areas have to go through.,and

46355_1,I hope.,People know the full story before having bad thoughts on another person or government.,Nan
46443_3,Mark said it's not the physical aspect that is hard.,You have your mind under control.,and
44751_1,I like that Sam talks about issues that are happening today.,I think too often its easy to just shut off the news.,because
46106_3,I think that it definitely opened my eyes up to what has been going on for centuries,It continues on today,and
45386_2,I picked the video of reconstruction.,It put a spotlight on even how slaves were 'freed' from being held captive by whites.,when
43087_1,This is an issue.,An issue that exists in America more than any other Western country.,Nan
42925_2,Many people in our society believe what is in the media.,What is told to them.,so
44452_1,There have been many victims of acts of terror.,There have been many accidents like what happened to Basim.,so
45214_1,We eventually became good friends.,She opened up to me about her family and about her past.,Nan

43895_1,I appreciate all that Obama has done for our country.,In some areas he hasn't done enough.,Nan
44104_1,Sam definitely achieved that effort in this lecture.,"He said he tries to get us to, see the world in a new complex way.",when
43525_2,This is a country founded upon religious tolerance and religious freedom.,We cannot create laws that are based on a single religion.,because
46026_1,Black people who grew up in this kind of inequality,how can suppression on their people be reasonable?,Nan
45360_1,"this fear that Americans experienced just from one act of terrorism, one day of horrible events.", think about the fear Iraqi citizens must go through on a daily basis with Isis having a stronghold in their home territory.,and
42845_1,I have felt a great amount of empathy towards people of other cultures lately.,I never took the time to step out of my shoes.,because
46113_4,Stereotypes remain in our society.,That is where the role of white people as black people comes in.,and
45909_1,Sam wanted the non-hijab wearing girls to understand.,Sam wanted a female perspective's questions of what a hijab can signify to them.,and
43893_1, he has been nicknamed the Deporter in Chief.,It is important that we criticize our President when needed in order to make sure that we stay informed.,because
45325_1,I think.,More people are open to having a conversation.,if
45973_4,They had to sign a contract.,This contract made black people not able to do things freely.,because
43382_6,"I think it needs to change, 100%.",It needs to change soon.,and
44524_1,I completely agree with you.,Knowledge is very important.,when
42813_1,Police officers go through a lot psychologically to help society.,It just really frustrates me that there are people out there that will look at all police officers and question their intentions.,Nan
44585_2,I cannot relate.,I understand why he has those sentiments towards the United States.,and
45163_1,The idea of wearing a hijab sounded inspiring.,The idea of wearing a hijab sounded empowering.,and
45964_1,For example it happened so long ago.,It wasn't even us.,Nan
46091_3,I felt the anger was just gonna eat me from the inside.,It was hurting me more than it was benefiting me.,and
45012_4,We see headlines.,We immediately believe whatever is said.,and
45363_1,Many people believe that politics should be kept out of sports.,I see where they are coming from.,and
45469_1,I had no clue when it was appropriate to take the hijabs off. ,These women were with other women or close family.,and
44491_3,I have to rely on my faith.,It will get me through something challenging.,Nan
45047_5,Facts were not read.,Videos were not seen.,because
43496_1,I had always thought.,I had always thought.,Nan

45785_3,We get to hear stories.,We don't just read out of a textbook.,and
45804_1,Are they not recognizing this?,They actually don't believe it.,because
43361_8, it is hard to see that Christians could be a part of many horrific hate groups.,it is much easier to see people who are Islamic as bad.,so
45723_1,We switched the races.,That really put it in perspective for me.,when
43635_2,I wish I had learned this earlier. ,I would have a more worldly perspective.,so
46038_2,It will help us better understand each other.,Maybe the military should be required to learn about the culture of the countries they enter.,and
44014_1,He said it.,I felt some emotions of sadness.,and
44557_5,It is about feeling you can make a solid argument.,It is an argument in favor of something.,if
43081_4,They need aid from people that will help them build their lives how they want to in order for them to be in peace. ,Everyone wants to have normal lives.,and
42907_1,Islam is talked about in this country as generalized way a lot.,He said that the reason is the staggering levels of Islamaphobia.,so
44253_4,He is a Muslim.,His religion says he must forgive others.,because
43138_3,that is not the same as the life of a civilian.,The civilian has lived through life over there as a war zone.,Nan
46203_4,We are a country focused on promoting freedom.,opportunities for everyone.,and
44724_1,I am embarrassed our country only offered him a small compensation.,He lost so much of his livelihood.,for
44864_4,I think about it mainly as history.,not about how it still exists in certain ways today.,and
44003_3,We hear what people are talking about. ,Black people are the main target of policemen.,and
44668_5,We don’t have slaves anymore. ,Black people are still being oppressed. ,and
46218_1,At first it was almost comical as Sam described the history of the fortunate and affluent black people.,because of natural resources around them and easy access to trade they excelled in society.,Nan
45408_1,My sister didnt have anything on her.,They were both arrested.,Nan
44991_7,More people should do what Sam did.,They should take the time to look over the history of what happened.,if
45831_1,His forgiveness is inspiring.,His strength is inspiring.,and
45520_6,The media talks about police brutality.,Some people think that it is talked about too much.,and
45282_1,Foster children are most likely to be African American.,The case worker is racially biased a lot of the time.,and
46201_3,they feel that these are all instances of the past,They think there is no need to continuously bring them up.,and
45531_2,It makes sense that African Americans know many things.,African Americans know about Black History.,so
45304_2,It is easy to say that the cop was protecting himself.,The cop was doing a white person's job.,as
44421_1,"Religion can be a great, important part of your life.",Religion shouldn't be the one to blame.,Nan
45443_1,The Taking a Knee movement started.,Colin Kaepernick participated.,when
44181_1,Not everybody who the American military kills is an enemy.,Many people are innocent like Basim.,Nan
43143_3,His youngest recorded victim was 12,some victims were rumored to be younger,and
43287_4,The only time we ever even consider exploring other topics.,We have something like extra credit assignments.,when
44056_1,This clearly shows that there is some racial bias that exists in the United States.,Maybe Kap is right about what hes doing.,for
43896_1,"In the past, I've relied so much on the media.",I've relied so much on the opinions of my elders to drive my thought process.,and
45860_2,Pictures of the different things such as lynching and post-slavery life.,You see how poorly people were treated.,Nan
43381_1,Everyone deserves to be able to live their lives to the fullest,"police brutality, especially directed towards minorities, needs to diminish",so
44759_1,Sams attempt at getting them to not answer politically correct seemed like he wanted them to say that the girls do look slutty due to their clothing.,Sam's attempt at getting them to not answer politically correct seemed like he wanted them to say that the girls do look unclean due to their clothing.,because
43164_1,But now the statistic.,That 22 out of every 233.,Nan
42801_2,His whole life was turned upside down.,The horror Isis has traumatized Bosum and his family.,because
43973_1,"Personally, I have grown up around many Christians.",I not grown up around a lot of Muslims.,and
44477_2,White people are often ignorant.,We have a history of oppressing them.,and
45494_1,It is unfair of us to expect police officers to be able to fully know and understand the law in a few short months.,We expect people who prosecute the law to spend three years dedicated to learning it.,when
44283_1,There's something else that stuck with me during this discussion.,It's the statistics of what race of people are.,Nan
43330_1,It's difficult to overcome a tragic event in his life.,I'm in awe of Basim's ability to overcome one of the most tragic events to happen to person.,so
44195_2,People are overly sensitive.,It comes to some topics like this.,when
45100_2,Ignorance is an important aspect of racism.,Ignorance needs to be discussed.,Nan
43050_4,He is matured.,He has intelligence that many in the world could benefit from.,and
46390_1,"Digging deeper , acknowledging the things that black people experienced is something that people should be educated in.","Digging deeper , acknowledging the things that black people experienced is something that people should understand.",and
46106_1,Having the roles reversed really gave me a glimpse into what it feels like to be discriminated against,I think that it definitely opened my eyes up to what has been going on for centuries,and
45956_2,it gave the race that was silenced for so long a chance to hold the upper hand in a conversation,we have white people hear them say things that sound insane to us,and
44668_2,Slavery happened a long time ago. ,We don’t have slaves anymore. ,because
45824_2,One of the students said something.,She feels the women wearing Hijab should feel more empowered due to it.,because
45738_2,There is an immense amount of division in this country.,That should not create division in our generation.,Nan
45951_1,However the black students could say it.,I think opened up the whole class for more honesty.,Nan
44311_1,I don't think so.,It will definitely take many years to come back from it.,Nan
45456_2,"I remember seeing a while back, a study was actually done to see how fast false information could be spread on social media.","I can't remember the actual stats, or who conducted it.",for
43020_4,Christianity is popular in our country,and therefore would make it seem like all Christians are violent.,because
46369_3,They say it was years ago.,Today there is equal opportunity.,and
44323_3,Basim helped the class understand.,Not everyone is lucky.,when
45699_3,I only believed things I knew.,I only perceived based off what I knew.,and
44250_1,He chooses to treat Americans with dignity.,He chooses to treat Americans with respect.,and
43186_2,Any foreign student at the school can be a teacher in our class.,It would allow us to be more knowledgeable of what is happening outside this country.,for
43672_1,"I think had the miserable accident happened to me, I would be furious.",I would go to extreme lengths to ensure the ones who caused the tragedy in my life to be severely punished.,and
43036_1,I agree with what Sam had mentioned about the generalizations.,Generalizations people in the U.S. make about Muslims.,Nan
44751_2,I think too often its easy to just shut off the news.,I think too often it's easy to walk away from a political conversation.,and
45611_2,It is very hard to study history.,We don't see the relevance today.,because
45132_2,The problems are caused by the extremists.,Those feel.,and
45623_2,I was definitely super surprised.,Things still are unequal.,so
44065_1,I don't take the extra step. ,Not into educating myself. ,Nan
42843_1,These people live in a different country.,It does not mean they should be in need.,because
44198_6,I had never seen a subsequent Mosul pic.,It opened my eyes.,and
44606_4,That raises the question of protesting not being right.,It is right.,and
44461_2,"Honestly, I think it is a bit sexist","A lot of women, wearing the Hijab is not a choice.",for
43433_1,How could someone do a certain thing?,How could someone forgive anyone under certain circumstances?,Nan
44016_1,I realized It is because it is what was becoming normal.,There really isn't anything that he could do to stop it from happening.,and
46086_1,They could be arrested.,It's for not checking in with their superiors.,for
43504_3,It is so easy to assume things about people from another religion.,It is so easy to assume things about people who look different.,because
44933_4,Why not try to negotiate?,Why not do things more peacefully?,and
44392_1,Yet I live in this country.,Almost everyone reading this lives in this country.,and
44042_3,There has been almost no media coverage at all.,This is going to the be the case.,and
45917_3,We are in the situation.,We only see what we want to see.,because
44158_1,This question is hard to answer. ,I think political people just put on a show. ,and
45448_1,We see Trump want to put an end to Obamacare.,He wants to end DACA.,and
44347_1,Hurricane Harvey hit in late august,money was raised,for
46038_1,We need to learn of the similarities and differences between cultures.,It will help us better understand each other.,Nan
46197_4,We complete autonomy in regards to personal decisions. ,We alone are the only ones who can judge ourselves. ,and
42822_2,Christians can interpret the Bible differently.,Muslims can interpret the Quran differently.,and
46003_2,We automatically shift blame towards the President.,It is easy to blame the President.,and
44271_1,Basim's story was really impactful.,It showed that he was able to see past those who killed his family.,because
45546_1,The slavery system was then replaced by Feudalism.,Some (key word being some) slaves then became serfs like 80% of the population.,Nan
45540_3,We can educate them about where the United States has gone wrong in the past.,We can teach them about ways it can be better in the future.,and
43995_3,We all need to stop seeing them like they are residents of a battlefield.,We should see them like the families they are.,as
45119_1,This is interesting to me.,People want you to think that more black people are being killed by police officers.,because
45007_5,They make people angry.,It causes people to go against what the players stand for.,and
46124_2,You relate it to their life.,You barely know them.,if
44103_2,Sams excitement about certain issues definitely stems out to the class.,I think its crazy he he tries hard to reach the issues from many different angles.,so
44936_7,Does it get too hot underneath?,Do they wear the hijabs all day?,and
44060_3,To have empathy you have to put yourself in someone else's shoes.,To have empathy you have to deeply try to feel what they're going through.,and
42872_1,It really is an amazing opportunity to listen to Sam. ,It really is an amazing opportunity to listen to what he talks about. ,and
46286_1,Nobody is informed completely.,Getting news from one source is irresponsible.,and
45088_1,It brings people together.,They understand what it feels like.,and
44149_4,He's come to terms with his situation.,allowed himself to still respect us as people.,and
44420_1,The human personality is much more than the sum of its parts.,Religion is just one of those may parts.,so
46310_2,They pretty much set the rules.,They controlled the outcome.,and
43108_1,It is often hard to picture a life without all the freedoms we have in America. ,It is often hard to picture a life without all the opportunities we have in America. ,Nan
45181_2,There will always be those who believe blacks aren’t equal. ,It’s just their skin pigment that is different. ,if
46144_1,A lot has happened throughout history.,This violence of white people against black people is a reason.,Nan
45963_1,The statements they were making to each other.,The regular remarks you hear.,Nan
43919_1,They have different views.,They implement very different laws that affect the American people.,and
44070_4,Who are they to tell me what I can do.,and cannot do.,and
44408_2,It is the deep-minded thinking of I am better than you.,i deserve better things than you.,so
44212_3,I also feel responsible.,These are Aermicans.,and
44744_3,It's on the tip of our fingertips.,It's social media.,and
44236_1,To be able to put yourself in someone elses shoes is incredibly difficult.,To really try to understand the struggle is incredibly difficult.,and
43855_2,"may be considered reverent anyway, ","may be considered reverent anyway, ",Nan
45173_2,I do realize how certain things in my religion can be up for interpretation., Certain things are up for interpretation for Muslims.,and
46261_1,I personally feel that racial inequality is such a great issue in this country., The people who created slavery never owned up for their wrong doings.,because
46248_1,I had never thought of it to be sexist either.,It was nice hearing that men wear certain pieces.,Nan
46001_4,He does have quite a lot of power.,He has influence under his belt.,and
45637_1,I find it crazy.,"Not that long ago, black people only counted as 3 5ths a person.",Nan
43738_2,We often do not recognize them.,We are very sheltered here in America.,because
42938_2,There were some he called his close friends.,Basim knew that our country did not intend for his tragedy to happen to him.,and
45930_3,They brought clarity.,The roles could have been reversed to easily.,and
45323_1,Mosul looks like a place in the US.,I never thought it did.,when
45144_2,The women might think they were being mean.,The truth they spoke might be mean.,because
44675_1,I'm drawn to the quote from To Kill a Mockingbird.,"""You never really understand a person until you consider things from their point of view...until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.""",Nan
43622_2,He believes that British people are more globally aware than American people.,From his personal experiences. ,Nan
44179_4,A foreign government killed your loved ones.,A foreign government destroyed your life.,and
44553_4,Maybe the United States government can't stop the war due to their conflicting differences.,I wish they at least took into consideration families like Basom's.,and
43122_2,We should express a message to the government.,Equality can solve everything.,Nan
43874_3,"He mentions we hear about Muslims killing other people, how they are terrorists, etc.",Sam is right.,and
46325_2,Sam talked.,White people did not want to give up what they had to black people.,and
45416_2,"The terrorist attacks that are happening in Uganda, South Sudan, CAR and the democratic republic of Congo are horrible.",I feel like what unfortunately happens is media doesn't cover those events.,Nan
42888_4,Peoples opinions about the police are not always positive.,They are often viewed as the bad guys.,because
46476_1,This class was awesome.,Sam brought up a few women wearing hijabs as well as a few girls who did not.,because
42947_2,it literally destroyed an environment.,I have never experienced the slightest bit of an attack.,and
46276_1,I watched some interviews.,I read some more articles.,and
43197_1,The stat was the armed vs. unarmed.,I didnt like being thrown around it,Nan
45018_1,They made it a little more dramatic that a typical person's response.,It added a little humor.,Nan
44096_1,I am a Democrat.,I believe.,and
45934_1,It brought police brutality to light.,It isn't something new.,Nan
42938_3,There were some he called his close friends.,Basim knew that our country did not intend for his tragedy to happen to him.,as
43995_4,We should see them like the families they are.,That is how we will move away from stereotyping.,and
43262_5,It's in the news a few weeks.,It takes up a lot of our attention.,and

46040_2,These kinds of things are not required by all people to learn.,It will be a long time before we are able to get rid of all of it.,so
44214_3,Our primary motivations for going into Iraq was to get something.,That wasn't even ours.,Nan
45832_2,These athletes are doing it peacefully.,It shouldn't bother anyone.,and
46361_2,We had white people explain the trauma they went through.,We had black people be superior on top.,as
43232_5,Armed black men have guns legally.,because guns are indeed legal in some states).,and
44042_5,This is going to the be the case.,Up to the time international voices demand that issue to be talked about. ,and
43151_1,This whole thing is a mess.,Your guess on a solution is comparable to anybody's.,as
43766_1,Hearing him say that being angry was killing him was so meaningful.,It speaks a lot to many religions that focus more on forgiveness than cruelty.,and
46353_1,It so easy to blame someone else.,Call it their problem.,for
45113_4,Someone would look at a black person.,Someone would think. ,and
43021_3, It would make us look bad.,Why do people in the U.S. make such quick judgements about people who are different?,so
45038_1,I was exposed to a variety of cultures at a young age.,I believe contributes to my willingness to step out of my comfort zone.,Nan
43262_7,It's in the news a few weeks.,It takes up a lot of our attention.,so
44767_1,They were questioned about the officer's wrongdoing.,The blacks defended him.,if
42791_2,"As people who are fortunate enough to live in such a safe country, we have been spoiled to think about our first-world problems.",Problems outside of the United States have never been such a constant reminder in our lives. ,and
46280_1,I think.,Racism is more systematically assembled in the world that I live in today.,and
44699_3,This class has really changed that.,I have learned how to empathize more with people I cannot relate to.,and
44553_3,Here's what I think.,Maybe the United States government can't stop the war due to their conflicting differences.,if
46495_1,Hearing the class about Native American history was so eye opening. ,We only learned the positive side of that era.,because
46405_3, I will refer to white people to  white people, I will refer to white people black people like black people,as
45774_3,People who are fighting for peace get attacked by communities.,People who are fighting for equality get attacked by communities.,and
45200_4,Blame white people for that. ,You have to do the the same to the Chinese and Africans who slaughtered people for land in the 1400's.,and
46094_2,My religion tells me to forgive.,My religion guides me through my life.,and
45769_2,We are a country that preaches freedom.,our history reflects the exact opposite.,and
46413_1,It could be that its not  common.,The Washington Post has a database of people killed by police in 2017.,as
44258_3,A lot of people don't know what's going on in certain countries.,They don't know where they are.,so
44013_2,He starts talking about ISIS.,They came to Mosul.,and
45356_2,Transit police forces increased.,No fly zones over major cities were implemented.,and
43290_1,Bassim told us an important message.,It was was to be passionate about other people.,Nan
43643_1,This was a great request.,This request is something we all need to adhere to.,because
43499_1,I'm not saying that these issues are not important.,Other issues should be brought to light.,Nan
44620_3,In northern regions you see a lot of hockey arenas because it is so cold.,"Back before our modern technology colleges could only go to areas to search for recruits and players, that would end up becoming professionals.",and
43573_1,I was very upset to hear about what happened to Basims family., I could not even imagine the pain he had to go through and is still going through.,Nan
44350_1,Basim experienced tragedy because of the American government.,Yet Basim forgives.,and
43657_1,Due to social media.,Those images started spreading fast.,because
44553_2,Here's what I think.,Maybe the United States government can't stop the war due to their conflicting differences.,and
43812_2,We generalize Christians to be innocent.,We generalize Christians to be holy.,if
45137_1,Understand your enemies.,You will be able to understand why you are having conflict with them.,if
46229_1,The question of Sexism Caught my attention., its unfair that its required to wear them .,and
46424_3,I personally never judged anyone who wore a hijab.,I did not think that wearing one for religious purposes was a big deal.,because
42815_3,Through social media. ,That Afghanistan is just some war zone. ,and
44606_7,It is right.,"No one should be getting killed by the cops, being unarmed.",if
45488_3,one group said that it was not a show of racism.,it was a a show of pride for their heritage.,and
42973_3,"The people of the country believe are doing the right things, and creating a better world.",They are not aware that it is much more complex than what it seems to be,Nan
44215_3,Sam asked the class to imagine if someone came to war here.,Someone wanted our natural gas. ,because
44916_4,A white person wasn't given justice. ,the black lives matter movement joined in to protest along side the family.,so
43043_4,I found out that people lost everything and in many cases.,It is due to our decisions as a country.,when
45930_2,They really opened my eyes.,They brought clarity.,and
42861_3,I admire his unbiased opinion towards american people.,Even with what happened to him and his family due to the U.S.,and
44884_3,It helped me build my perspective on the world we live in.,It helped me build my perspective on the race in our society.,and
44708_4,This lesson made people more aware about the reality of how other people live.,This lesson made people more aware about what they have to deal with on a daily basis.,and
44763_2,she also has to walk outside everyday.,She realizes that she'll be critically judged by others.,and
44950_2,Several US Presidents were involved in the war.,Bush served in office.,as
46166_6,They wanted people to listen to them,They  suffer from the consequences of slavery era even that it ended years ago.,and
44567_1,There are plenty of sources out there that I could use.,There are plenty of sources to acquire information on worldly issues.,for
42938_4,There were some he called his close friends.,Basim knew that our country did not intend for his tragedy to happen to him.,because
45523_2,More people became informed.,More people knew the proper statistics.,if
46511_1,Hijabs are everyday things. ,Some people judge them out of ignorance from knowing nothing about them. ,Nan
44659_1,It is a small stepping stone.,"Show someone some perspective, it could go a long way.",if
45249_1,I am an international student.,I am here at Penn State.,so
44243_5,"Love others, letting go of any hate you harbor inside.","How Bassim has the ability to do that, he has my utmost respect.",for
46252_2,"However, I am impressed.",I admire that there are lots of people who like Basim.,and
44491_1,I do not think I would have the courage.,I do not think I would have the strength.,and
45341_5,She said that she was comfortable in her religion.,She didn't feel the need to wear one.,and
45817_3,We are always hearing about foreign dangers.,We have to realize that the people living in those countries can also be harmed from those same people.,and
45663_1,That happened to my country.,My friends and family were killed.,and
45662_1,This was one of my favorite classes.,It really opened my eyes to the truth.,because
46279_2,I see far more white actors and actresses than I do any other race.,I feel like a lot of the wealth in the world today is held by white people.,as
46244_1,I completely agree.,I like what you have written.,Nan
45023_2,I have realized that there is a significance to what is happening across the world.,It is important to be aware of what is going on.,and
42888_1,I think she was nervous.,Peoples opinions about the police are not always positive.,and
45117_3,It seemed like the entire class was pretty shocked to see these statistics.,There's only one reason people have this image in their head of black people being killed by police officers more often.,and
45065_3,I immediately listened.,I have never heard a prayer like that before.,because
43564_1,It was sad to hear and see.,The city has ended up being now.,and
42872_2,It really is an amazing opportunity to listen to what he talks about. ,It does open your eyes.,and
43186_1,Any foreign student at the school can be a teacher in our class.,It would allow us to be more knowledgeable of what is happening outside this country.,and
45672_1,I never knew.,life after the civil war was worse for former slaves than it was before the civil war.,Nan
43986_4, We can choose to believe them.,We can decide ourselves what is true.,and
44515_1,I watched a video on an Indian man that posed African American.,It was to get into a top 5 med school in the country.,as
44771_2,Sam asked if they paid attention to the news. ,Specifically the white lives matter movement. ,and
45666_5,my entire reason why i am living is  my family.,my entire reason why i am living is my friends.,for
44733_1,Grudges and hate are both pointless and sinful.,They both tear the bonds that we form.,as
46383_3,I feel that I have a better understanding to how my ancestors grew up.,"Insight into how badly blacks were treated in America, gave me insight.",and
45215_1,Her dad was having trouble getting a job on wall street.,Her dad was facing intense racism.,and
43603_1,I pray for people who share the same situation as Basim.,I personally do not know if I could continue to live if most of my family were to die how Basims family died.,because
46126_2,"Most thoughts seemed to be naive, immature.","Immature in a way like arent they hot, do they play sports, ect. ",and
45394_3,It was funny to hear the different sides.,Black people talked like modern day white people.,if
44164_1,It is important to understand that not all police use brutal force,Some are hurt or killed while on duty.,and
44750_1,This class is so fun and interesting. ,You never know what to expect. ,when
44870_1,"People, in no way, I would ever call racist.",People are  just uneducated.,and
43650_1,We need to be aware of the world around us.,There is much we do not know about it.,so
44003_2,We hear from the interent.,We hear what people are talking about. ,and
46345_4,Without even giving them a chance to a fair trial.,how they would kill them is even worse.,Nan
43774_13,Pensions are not improving. ,wages are same.,and
46147_5,I felt the anger was just gonna eat me from the inside.,Anger was hurting me more than it was benefiting me.,and
44023_5,It makes me question them acting in our best interest.,They are willing to jeopardize people's lives to profit economically.,if
42791_1,As Americans we have been spoiled to think about our first-world problems.,"As people who are fortunate enough to live in such a safe country, we have been spoiled to think about our first-world problems.",and
43985_3,I have learned a lot.,There is much more to learn.,and
43564_4,I was amazed by Bassim Razzos optimism.,He will hopefully be able to go back there soon.,as
45117_5,There's only one reason people have this image in their head of black people being killed by police officers more often.,There's one reason they think they're discriminated against by police officers.,and
44996_3,White supremacists are not true Christians.,We call Muslim extremists Muslims.,and
43419_1,I was completely disgusted with this whole situation.,I was completely disgusted with  the way the government dealt with it.,and
44882_3,It was the white male with a felony.,They were hired more than a black male with a clean record.,Nan
45520_5,The media talks about police brutality.,Some people think that it is talked about too much.,and
43291_4,we should try not to support slavery like this,we grow up and start and interact with businesses ourselves.,as
46436_1,The desert there is beautiful.,"In the winter, it gets very chilly.",and
46031_1,It is always easier to show them that the wrong way is not the only way.,The right way is also beneficial to them.,and
43538_2,You need to respect what people believe.,You need to let everyone follow their own path.,and
43034_1,You could hear the hurt in the voice of the gentleman from the reserve.,He choked down tears.,as
44104_2,"He said he tries to get us to, see the world in a new complex way.",This more complex way has personally hit me hard.,when
43310_1,There is a lack of formal education on current polotical issues.,There's a lack of formal education on foreign countries.,and
44788_1,"Fear, terror in other countries.",It's heartbreaking other countries have no choice.,because
46319_3,The issues that dominated our society will only help us come to resolution,The issues that dominated our society will only help us to fix these problems.,and
45598_1,I was also shocked.,Sam pulled up the statistics.,when
43119_4,It all depends on persons perspective of how they see religion.,Thoughts about different groups of people.,and
44456_1,It was my first time hearing women with Hijabs express their feelings.,It was my first time hearing women with Hijabs express their opinions towards it.,and
44167_1,Bassim couldn't be any more right.,There are people who are in need around the world.,Nan
44494_2,He trusted his faith.,It helped him move on.,and
46271_8,The major thing that I have learned is that it is  important to have empathy towards people.,It is  extremely important to see things from different perspectives.,so
44683_4,I am loving people for the good.,I am loving people for the bad.,and
45568_3,They know.,Many presidents before them share the same qualities.,Nan
42884_1,Why the media reports stories pertaining to African Americans being shot.,They have commented that this is due to their race.,so
44438_1,The police felt threatened by the man sitting in the car.,That's why the police beat the man up.,so
43368_3,a life time experience.,I completely agree.,Nan
44441_1,These people who are seen as threats may not always be a threat.,Police are quick to assume that they are.,and
44551_2,it made me realize how many other families had to go through the same thing.,It is so unfair and cruel. ,and
46280_2,Racism is more systematically assembled in the world that I live in today.,It is still holding people of color back.,and
45948_4,It allowed people to open up more.,It allowed more honest past mindsets to shine through.,for
43295_1,I have linked the full lecture from September 14.,where Sam talked about Black Devils.,and
44039_2,People assume that every single one is done by Muslims.,Islamic radicals like ISIS take credit.,and
44767_3,The blacks defended him.,They said it is up to the officer's discretion.,if
44119_1,It may not be able to be taught in high schools.,Sunday Schools should touch on these topics more during their lessons.,if
43759_1,Maybe one of the reason is that today the society is so fast.,We don't even stop a minute to reflect on a very simple concept like empathy.,and
44013_1,He starts talking about ISIS.,They came to Mosul.,and
44804_4,They decided to adhere to some of the beliefs.,or they made a personal decision to not.,Nan
44301_1,I strongly believe.,The tables were turned.,and
44460_4,Other people would not focus on her looks.,They would focus on what is inside her mind.,and
44972_1,It were you or a member of your family going through these things.,Would you want it to be swept under the rug?,if
43188_1,The Obama administration had restrictions.,They limited air strikes where there was potential for civilian deaths.,when
43829_2,Once we truly believe.,Loving and understanding others will become secondary nature.,Nan
43331_1,"Hearing Basim tell his story was a very emotional point in the class, I think, for many people.",its not often that you hear about how the American governments decisions affect real people and real families.,because
44419_5,That only feeds the hate.,That only feeds the tension between us.,because
43163_1,Most people assumed the numbers were much higher. ,The African American numbers were assumed to be much higher. ,if
43962_5,I believe that to truly make change in this country we have to come together.,by kneeling during the national anthem you create an even greater separation.,and
43981_4,having those morals is not something that should shut one down from the thoughts.,having those morals is not something that should shut one down from opinions of others.,and
46302_1,I think that the girls made a good point.,They said it's different for every individual.,when
44570_1,My high school are too focused on our problems.,Many others around our country are too focused on our problems.,and
45388_3,Many were not given access to schooling or quality education of any kind.,Many black people were not literate and lacked the skills to thrive in these fields.,and
45418_6,Basim should be someone that everyone aspires to be.,his values are so strong where he is only coping so that he can be there for his son and not look at the negativity in life.,because
44884_1,I learned a lot from this lecture.,It helped me build my perspective on the world we live in.,and
43173_2,I'm surprised when Sam mentioned that Bible didn't explain details of premarital sex and co-habitation.,I'm surprised when Sam mentioned that Bible didn't explain details of use of alcohol.,Nan
43363_4,They are forgiving like Bassim.,They think to themselves.,and
45732_3,It would be best to eventually let it go.,It would be best to learn to forgive.,and
46096_4,I gain wisdom.,I reflect on what my religion tells me to  do.,and
45825_2,we are surrounded by so much diversity and opportunity.,we have all the reason in the world to have an open mind.,because
44668_1,Slavery happened a long time ago. ,We don’t have slaves anymore. ,and
43233_4,the person just listened.the black,the person just listened.the black,if
45946_3,Too many innocent lives are being taken.,It is because of some heinous acts commetted by cops.,because
43234_3,They are meant to protect this country.,Minorities are part of this country.,and
43191_3,"The United States can physically fire weapons in a country, not currently a war zone.",There is nothing stopping the US from flying these drones over every country in the middle east.,and
46276_2,I read some more articles.,"I realize that Jesus most likely had dark skin, brown hair and darker eyes.",and
46459_3,it is considered public nudity.,"In most places a crime a woman to expose her breast in public , men can do so.",for
44378_2,it has to come down to the people of the United States to call.,THe people to call for some sort of change. ,Nan
44599_1,There's another side of the argument.,They are not disrespecting the flag.,Nan
46003_4,We automatically shift blame towards the President.,It is easy to blame the President.,so
45982_1,A girl named Stacy asked him why he was not more angry about what had happened to him.,he copes with the horrible things that he has been through.,and
46210_2,They're not protesting our troops.,There are always people out there who want to cause drama.,and
45150_1,I dont believe that it is really forgiving the US governments minor accident., The US governments minor accident had devastating consequences on him.,Nan
43807_1,I feel a couple of main reasons of opposition is just disagreement with the statement of racial inequality. ,It is possibly even something as simple as politicizing sports. ,for
46189_2,I think that it is a peaceful protest.,theyre trying to make a statement.,and
46150_2,I didn't even realize it until Bassim made that statement.,I often turn to God when I need guidance in my life.,Nan
43405_3,We Americans are always very quick to point fingers at others.,We don't even own up to our own mistakes.,so
45547_4,Serfs gave the ruling party most of their resources.,Serfs had no growth opportunities.,for
44249_3,It is much harder to forgive others.,They have treated you.,for
44152_6,Americans feel pride toward our country .,We also don't always focus on things that are not happening on our soil.,as
44253_2,He has taught himself to forgive.,He is a Muslim.,because
46127_3,We make judgments.,We have the opportunity to be open.,and
44957_2,"For the first time, I wondered.",Their votes would have even made a difference.,if
44647_6,Black people are persecuted.,discriminated against for the color of their skin every day.,and
45434_1,They said they wear things like the American girls across from them.,They wear bikinis in their homes.,and
46407_2,There are thousands of statistics to back that up.,Simply being a minority cannot be the excuse.,Nan
46371_4,They thought we were bashing white people.,It was getting a little taste of our own medicine.,as
45042_3,I think this was a very good idea  Sam to flip the history of black people., I said many white people do not think this sense of racism is around.,and
44528_1,The disconnect you feel when you hear a story or see a picture is not there.,The people who have lived those situations are right in front of you.,because
44252_1,Apply Islam to your life.,It will make your life better.,and
45067_2,I found this section relatively short.,It was incredibly interesting.,because
44926_4,We look at people for how they truly are.,We look not how they are thought of to be.,and
44316_2,its going to be hard on Iraq to come back from the damage ISIS has caused,than probable conflict in the near future.,for
46385_2,"In your response, you recalled.",Sam said.,Nan
46112_1,I think this puts into perspective of black people. ,that is the only excuse the black people could come up with during the panel.,if
44735_2,I thought the beginning of the exercise was powerful.,Sam began talking about how Africans simply used their resources/wit to travel up through Europe.,when
44984_1,It doesn't characterizes someone in any certain way.,I think that should be emphasized more in this day.,and
44383_1,These were probably the heaviest.,These were probably the most moving 15 minutes of sociology 119 so far.,and
43583_1,The next thing that Sam discussed was the military in its areas of protection.,We discussed this versus a business standpoint.,Nan
45467_2,We are cusping on the generation that was used to the inequality of America.,We are transitioning on more of an accepting generation.,and
44173_1,A lot of the information that we need to know is hidden.,A lot of the history is not the whole truth.,and
45270_1,I never thought about comparing Christian violence.,It is equal to Muslim violence.,as
43009_1,He knew it would be better to practice forgiveness.,His religion encourages forgiveness.,as
45539_1,Our generation is to be the new leaders.,We have the power to change how things are.,as
45882_5,It took our preconceived notions about race.,It switched the skin colors.,because
43404_1,I was shocked to hear his house was accidentally bombed by the Americans.,No one really paid attention to it.,and
43939_5,The war was immoral.,just to talk to someone from Iraq who was unjustifiably harmed by it is incredible.,and
46042_5,Being angry was bad for him internally.,He has been through things.,so
45085_3,They were to be with several men.,The names people would call them.,if
45739_1,Our generation should be responsible.,"Our generation should strictly condemn those who think their race is superior,",and
44885_1,I'm a Christian.,I can honestly say I don't know much of what the holy bible consists of.,Nan
45187_2,The black side put on this mask that tried to emulate the Bad guy type of white person.,They're  only saying rude things.,Nan
46443_2,Going through these journeys opens up your mind to new ideas.,Mark said it's not the physical aspect that is hard.,as
44461_6,"A lot of women, wearing the Hijab is not a choice.","Especially, one was to travel to a country like Iraq.",if
43868_1,I was not surprised.,Bassim said.,when
42820_2,Something baffles me.,It baffles me to watch the news.,and
46462_3,Female hair can be sexualized.,Female hair should be covered up.,and
43340_4,The war will eventually end.,"Hopefully, ISIS will eventually leave.",when
46161_1,They were absolutely wonderful.,it was interesting to see their perspective about wearing it.,and
43579_4, I do hope they are more careful.,These are real people's lives at stake.,because
42889_1,Brenna made it a point to inform us that her father is often scared.,He goes to work.,when
46271_2,I have realized  many things in the first half of this semester from this class.,The major thing that I have learned is that it is  important to have empathy towards people.,for
42946_1,Our army has left this entire society with nothing but a broken system. ,A community in which people of the future will be negatively impacted.,and
43477_1,That is another point I would like to bring up.,The US Embassy tried recompensing Basim.,for
44421_2,Religion shouldn't be the one to blame.,Religion shouldn't be the one to justify your actions .,and
45222_2,I live in a country where I am not scared.,I am safe on a daily basis.,for
45852_2,I have learned.,I hope the other people think about the racial issues.,and
44205_1,It is easy for someone who does not believe in homosexuality to take use part of the Bible to fuel their justification.,They are against homosexuality.,and
44186_1,I believe that is why Basim does not hate Americans.,He understands that we are not very different from each other.,because
45635_3,it is important to spread awareness about what happened in Americas history,It is important to make sure people know the real story in regards to slavery in America,so
43906_2,Christians tend to be hateful more often than Muslims are,Christians aren't going to hate on themselves.,and
46353_4,It's harder to act like an adult.,It's harder to actually resolve the issue.,and
45011_5,We've been seeing many instances where police brutality has become really bad.,Police are killing black people.,so
45795_1,I like all of what Collin Capernick stands for.,what Collin Capernick he is representing.,and
45113_5,Someone would think. ,they are guiltier than a white person.,Nan
46467_1,"They actually enjoy it , some of them mentioned that they felt more protected they went outdoors with hijabs.","It was funny , a bit cute they mentioned it.",when
45927_1,Sometimes it is good to receive feedback.,Some people aren't in the situation that we are in.,Nan
45759_2,People could really think about the data.,They could think about the facts of American History.,and
45338_2,It is disrespectful to the men and women who have served.,Plenty of Americans loop up to the flag.,Nan
44895_1,I took from this part of the lecture.,Some morals in the bible are followed more religiously compared to others.,Nan
45218_1,We think that we have all of the answers.,We absolutely don't,when
45966_2,we can really come together.,"get other races to believe , to  join us.",if
45708_1,I saw Sam choke up like that.,It had me worried.,Nan
45797_1,We don't know who is behind the cause. ,We don't know who is protesting. ,and
43287_3,The only time we ever even consider exploring other topics.,We have something like extra credit assignments.,and
44109_1,This is partially our own fault.,The news reports what they think we will want to hear.,because
44574_2,"In reality, there are many Afghans like Basim who are kind and generous.",They simply want the world to be a better place.,and
45393_1,"These people (many of them, for that matter) did not have adequate education or preparation for the work industry.",to expect them to be able to be able to beat out competition (with many people who were still incredibly racist) is so unethical.,and
45298_4,Truly diving in is nearly impossible.,Understanding what exactly you're supposed to be seeing is nearly impossible.,so

43234_1,Policemen should be held to a higher standard.,They are meant to protect this country.,because
43683_1,I found this moment very powerful.,This man is able to forgive Americans for what happened to his family.,because
43490_1,It is unfortunate to think about innocent people like Basim struggling.,There is way on their homeland.,because
45071_2,Bassim states that it is probably the biggest problem for the Iraqi people. ,This makes me wonder if our involvement in the Middle East caused this issue. ,and
46342_2,Consider the regular citizen.,They would claim they have no association with the KKK.,Nan
44940_4,I remember my senior year of high school reading Persepolis.,Persepolis is a graphic novel where the young girl grows up during the Islamic Revolution in the 1980s.,when
43943_3,I cannot tell you how much respect I have for Basim.,He was able to forgive.,and
45490_5,Weeding out those with bias is often hard.,its such an inherent and subconscious phenomenon that is hard to set qualifications for.,because

46330_2,It was a surprise to me.,I heard about how vast it is.,Nan
44118_3,"Not being able to discuss religion, at a younger age especially makes us ignorant.",It makes us naive to those around us.,because
46287_1,I found the segment when the non-hijab-wearing women tried on hijabs particularly eye-opening.,it made me understand what it means to wear a hijab so much better.,because
43479_1,I feel a certain way.,My entire life is a certain way.,Nan
44707_2,I think that we should be more active when black people feel like they are not being heard. ,I think that we should be more cooperative when black people feel like they are not being heard. ,because
44704_1,Here's an example.,Sam asked the girl sitting on the white side.,for
43525_6,Not everyone practices the same religion., thus not everyone has the religious beliefs and values.,as
45604_5,Finding out that wearing the hijab was actually a choice was actually kind of a surprise for me.,Finding out that all the Muslim women who wear hijab do it because they chose to do so was actually kind of a surprise for me.,so

45758_1,He answered the questions I had pertaining to what is going on in Afghanistan.,I enjoyed listening to his story.,and
43688_5,He should forgive.,He should not hate.,because
45697_4,Basim's story about forgiving runs in my head.,"Basim can forgive, I should too.",and
43426_1,It is a predomantely Christian country.,It is like the United States of America.,as
43690_1,This has led to a lot of misplaced hate around the religion.,It leaves people uninformed about what the religion truly is.,and
45632_5,Their ancestors are immigrants.,Their ancestors were not banned from coming to this country.,and
46414_3,Those who did not attempt to flee the scene were mostly White people.,"Those who were unarmed were mostly White people (8 White, 4 Black, 4 Hispanic, 1 other).",and
45017_3,Some black people act like white people.,They talk about their ancestors.,if

44205_3,They are against homosexuality.,People like that have not really looked at the Bible.,for
43183_3,The main thing that I have taken from it is how the news outlets are biased.,They are steered towards either the left or the right.,and

43741_5,He was able to see past our military.,Every American was not responsible for what happened to his family.,and
44445_1,Black people are seen more as a threat.,Cops arrest them for drug use drug dealing.,so
43519_3,We are busy being judging people.,We do not see our own faults.,because
42781_4,He pointed out that he would not let anger eat him alive. ,I really admired his courage,and
45923_3,we see it from the outside we are not always expose to it.,We tend to know more about it.,because

43692_1,As youve already stated,As youve already stated,for
45117_1,It's crazy to me.,It seemed like the entire class was pretty shocked to see these statistics.,and
43508_3,These days it is really important to remember this.,Pessimism will make us angry. ,and
44686_1,We're all different.,We see other parts of each other that make us friends.,Nan
42807_5,They see social media posts.,They generalize about all police officers.,and

43194_1,Our military leaders now have to assess.,The risk of civilian death outweighs the benefit of destroying the enemy.,when
45241_2,It is his constitutional right to not stand during the national anthem.,what he did is not disrespectful toward the flag.,and
46074_1,Certain white people have argued that by banning slavery was enough to help black people,Not aiding support to former slaves made conflict unavoidable.,Nan
43373_1,I hope those people who have a bad outlook on Muslims had their eyes opened.,Bassim talked to us in class the other day.,when

44996_1,I love the point Sam makes.,Many Americans say Christian extremists are not true Christians.,as
44815_5,I thought that it is common in American.,They stereotype other people easily.,because
43846_3,We listen.,We grow. ,and
44961_3,I found the class interesting. ,I heard how ridiculous some of the arguments from whites are. ,so
45085_2,Women face.,They were to be with several men.,if
44624_6,There was a bias that blacks were good at ball.,It is starting to go away.,because

42838_3,They do not understand them.,It is not happening right in front of them.,because
45531_1,It makes sense that African Americans know many things.,African Americans know about Black History.,because

43213_1,a Sharia system is made out of a religious text,It is the very reason many people of any religion get into arguments over the true meaning of certain doctrines.,so

43208_4,Trigger happy monsters are running around.,Trigger happy monsters are protecting and serving.,Nan
43011_1,You made a very good point in saying that.,Forgiveness is something that benefits all of us.,Nan
46245_3,I had many unanswered questions. ,It was very interesting listening to the girls perspectives on it.,and
43020_3,People will never say Christians are killing Christians.,Christianity is popular in our country,because
46037_1,I currently hold a negative view on the middle east.,My family has endured.,and
45365_5,It's so they are able to play football.,These athletes are squashing all of the military's hard work.,and
43014_1,People make generalizations. ,The media depicts them in generalized terms. ,because
44467_2,Basim is still a loving individual.,This is the most inspirational part of all this.,when
43591_4,Basim is forgiving. ,The unimaginable happened to Basim.,and
45774_1,Why don't the hate groups get no penalty.,People who are fighting for peace get attacked by communities.,for
46011_6,They may think that it is a problem., attempt to address and fix it.,and
42808_1,The media is not going to post all the good things the majority of police officers do.,They are going to post whatever gets the most attention.,for
43034_4,He choked down tears.,He talked about how this country makes him feel.,when

43047_4,War acts swiftly with no remorse.,War acts swiftly with no regrets.,and
43382_2,"Being a white woman, I don't understand that fear in relation to the police/police brutality.","It is tragic, the extent of people who have to experience it.",as
45425_2,People with nonwhite names are discriminated against.,People with nonwhite names are discriminated against in white dominant areas.,Nan
44587_1,I agree the media tries to paint a picture to their liking in order to gain support.,They know they cant accomplish anything without the public's support.,because
42831_1,I thought it was very interesting.,I never thought about how this class changes.,because
46439_1,"Every time I got to the desert with my family, we pack twice as much food and water as we need.",In all honesty going to the desert is like going to a park.,and
44468_4,He only has ill will towards the government.,which is completely warranted.,Nan
42825_2,I believe that the bad acts that Christians do are too.,The bad acts are often the ones that seem to stick in the mind of the listener.,as
46309_4,Slavery was stopped.,Also a step backwards.,because
43009_2,His religion encourages forgiveness.,He did it.,as
43890_2,They are considering reducing wages.,They are considering reducing pensions.,and
45482_4,Men are being made to grow a beard.,They cut their ankles.,and
43258_3,There are certainly times where aid is necessary.,We need more stringent standards going forward.,when
45927_2,Some people aren't in the situation that we are in.,Sometimes we fail to understand what is actually going on.,because
43358_3,We would learn not to generalize people based on some piece of information.,We would think about situations on a case by case basis. ,and
44859_3,They draw attention to a movement they believe in.,Kneeling during the national anthem is not the right place to do it.,and
45366_1,What many people dont know though is that there are some athletes that talk directly to people in the service.,They do not want to minimalize all of the militarys efforts.,because
43318_2,They are the same ones who wear the flag on their t-shirts.,This is ironic.,Nan
44446_1,"One of the girls mentioned that whenever she gets pulled over, shes scared.","one of the guys mentioned that whenever he gets pulled over, hes scared how high his traffic ticket is going to be.",for
44006_1,The girls were surprised at the results., It had been completely different from what they had thought of.,as
44583_1,why would Basim look at them different?, none of them have made a positive difference.,when
45204_2,White people benefit today.,They benefit from past dominance.,because
46452_2,They only wear their hijabs for unfamiliar men.,They only cover their skin for going outside.,and
46484_1,I think that the racial divide in this country comes from an unfamiliarity. ,I think that the racial divide in this country comes from a sort of border between races.,and
46383_5,I feel that I have a better understanding to how my ancestors grew up.,"Insight into how badly blacks were treated in America, gave me insight.",for
44553_9,"Like you said, these are real people's lives at stake.",they should be taken serious.,and
45920_1,Sometimes we fail to understand.,That people from the outside have different beliefs.,Nan

43752_1,We talked about issues. ,Some issues were not present at first.,if

44428_5, we have an extent of responsibility for what happened.,but how we are going to help mend it.,and
45156_1,This positivity shows his acceptance.,The positivity will continue to have meaning with hislife.,and
44893_5,People turn to the Bible in order to handle the aspects of divorce.,People turn to the Bible in order to handle what is considered an appropriate reason to get a divorce.,and

43028_1,They are kneeling to show that there is still inequality and injustices in America.,Inequality and injustices in America need to be dealt with.,Nan
44916_1,To add on to that.,Sam mentioned how a white person was murdered by police.,Nan
44188_2,I think it’s due to Christianity being the norm in the US. ,It’s what the majority of the country practices. ,because
44074_4,It does not use facts.,It does not come up with a reasonable conclusion.,and
42856_1,This is our fault.,we tend to want to hear about celebrities glorified lives and every step they take,because
45274_2,I never thought of how strange it would be.,People of your own color are associated with representing demeaning circumstances.,and
43771_3,"here in the United States when someone else becomes President, their polices are different from the previous President.",an assumption would be that the foreign policy for Iraq would be different,so
45834_3,I'm being completely honest.,I was shocked to see more Caucasian people have been killed by the police than African Americans.,and
42975_1,Sam telling us that there is no set schedule of topics really made me think.,He can just decide one week what he wants to bring up in class.,because
44078_1,That is where the Quran fail as a platform for a government system.,The Bible fail as a platform for a government system.,and
46271_4,I have realized  many things in the first half of this semester from this class.,The major thing that I have learned is that it is  important to have empathy towards people.,so
44204_1,Sam had people raise their hands.,They would not Hell according to the quote.,if
45526_5,I believe I am given freedom because of those who served our country. ,I know I stand for the same reason the football players kneel for what they believe in. ,and
44447_3,Black people are scared for their lives.,A police pulls them over.,when
46432_2,Sharecropping seemed like a convenience thing.,That's really the same as calling it a coincidence.,when
43960_3,We were allowed to respond to.,They didn't change from last week.,because
46282_4,"Statistics can lie, you cannot take them at face value always.",You cannot use them they are not a backbone of beliefs.,because
45907_1,It's not true.,There are many innocent civilians people forget about.,so
43237_3, who were wrongly killed , who were wrongly killed ,Nan
44257_3,It's really important.,We should know where America stands on social issues.,when
45463_3,my ancestors were alive and well during the Civil Rights movement,that is where I felt that white people were at their most ignorant due to the ingrained inequality thought process that,and
45380_4,There are better ways to show your opinions.,There are more appropriate ways to show your opinions.,and
45165_1,I thought about Catholic nun's attire.,"Catholic nun's attire resemble a chador, another form of Islamic covering.",and
45361_3,It is bringing some stability to Iraq.,He is not optimistic about the future for Iraqi youths.,Nan
44144_2,It definitely comes down to individual choice.,Whether Steph wants to go to the White House for recognition.,as
44292_3,They think we made everything much better.,I think we have made an impact to an extent.,and
43201_1,That is why I wish the class had been longer on that subject.,No doubt we would have gotten around to talking about it.,for
45607_5,I believe that more people should really get to know principals of other religions,we would all be a lot more tolerant with one another.,and
43777_3,Muslims look at the United States. ,They think we are their enemies. ,because
44830_3,Lacking the  experience with Iraqi citizens., can see how the decision to invade at the cost of much of Iraq might be made.,and
42852_2,The people who lived there had minimal rights.,They never left their little huts.,and
43774_12,Health care isn't improving.,Pensions are not improving. ,and
44201_1,The Bible and the quarantine are open to interpretation. ,This is why radicals exist. ,and
45487_6,You could see how comfortable they were in their body.,they were saying those things because they had heard them almost all their lives.,and
44996_2,Many Americans say Christian extremists are not true Christians.,White supremacists are not true Christians.,as
43025_2,I think that everyone has a right to protest.,These athletes are protesting peacefully.,so
45533_2,I was really shocked to see the statistics in class.,The statistics were about wealth.,and
45191_1,This is increasingly difficult with the media shaping people's ideas.,"This is increasingly difficult, quite frankly, having a nation of sheep.",and
42854_1,Many Americans tend to not educate themselves.,They do not educate themselves on topics that are unrelated to them.,Nan
44104_4,I looked at a person like myself (an African American at Penn State) from the shoes of someone across the world.,with completely different advantages and hardships as myself.,Nan
42975_5,He can just decide one week what he wants to bring up in class.,that means there was possibly something that made him think of it.,because
44101_3,I observed the political and racial world around me,Class has taught me my believes might not be relevant,Nan
42806_1,I also think.,It is awful.,when
43500_3,People have many misconceptions of the island.,The have never learned about Puerto Rico in high school.,and
44552_2,He shifted that hate he had inside due to this injustice.,He turned it into a lesson.,and
46214_1,These were facts I never knew.,Thank you for bringing them to my attention Sam!,so
45135_3,There is human nature of collectivization.,Similar people with similar values will have multiple flash points of tension.,Nan
43806_4,I support what they are protesting.,I can see why some people would be frustrated with it.,and
42861_1,I admire his level of forgiveness.,I admire his unbiased opinion towards american people.,and
46242_1,Traveling is an amazing way to learn more about different people.,Getting to know people that follow a specific religion is an amazing way to learn more about different people.,and
45978_1,We talk to Basim and learn about his experiences and history.,It shed an amount of light on us.,Nan
45110_3,An officer beat him for no reason.,The reporter said that the officer did nothing wrong.,and
46412_1,I have very rarely seen a story of police brutality in the news.,The victim is a white person.,Nan
42926_4,"In my hometown, you never meet a certain type of person without going away to college.",of Muslim religion.,Nan
44865_2,It was hard to not find it comical.,It was very skewed.,because
43661_1,As Sam has mentioned many times we are told that the Middle East is always at war.,the Middle East is always killing each other.,and
46295_2,"Going out in public, I usually will wear long-sleeves.",I won't if it is really hot out.,so
44287_1,During their campaign the begin with false promises. ,They are unable to attain those ideas. ,and
45202_1,Slavery is a horrible human offense.,White people are not the first humans in history to use slaves.,Nan
44708_3,This lesson made people more aware about the reality of how other people live.,This lesson made people more aware about what they have to deal with on a daily basis.,and
44662_3,The worry was short lived.,I remembered I was in SOC119 class.,Nan
46197_6,We alone are the only ones who can judge ourselves. ,We hold ourselves to our own standards that we see fit. ,and
45981_1,We had the opportunity to ask him questions about what had happened to him., how he felt about it which was a unique experience considering what he has been through in his life.,and
44537_1,The anthem is about our fallen soldiers.,"When a teammate is injured, everyone on the team kneels down anyways.",Nan
46281_1,I enjoyed the lecture.,It humbled both sides of government.,because
43362_7,We think about that.,We say they really aren't Christians to ourselves.,when
44126_1,I am learning to place myself.,In other peoples shoes more.,Nan
44466_1,I always figured a bombing would need to take a lot of planning.,I always figured a bombing would take careful execution.,and
45109_2,The switch is so hard to go along with.,It was just so extreme.,because
45203_1,We can blame slavery on all white people.,Whites were the last to do it.,because
43887_4,They need to talk.,They need to learn and grow from people who are indeed having those experiences.,and
43778_3,the media sensationalizes.,i feel ok,and
46201_2,"They were topics like slavery, racism, and oppressive acts done to African Americans",they feel that these are all instances of the past,because
45790_2,People were told to watch one another.,The had to report on anyone who may have had any form of privilege.,and
44133_1,I can honestly say that I wasn't even aware of this until this class.,It's really sad.,Nan
43747_1,We pay more attention to these students.,We can learn many things from the international students.,if

44596_1,We don't even notice that the media is doing this to us.,We are quick to assume that whatever the media posts is true.,because
45098_2,I was not taught this when I was younger.,Teachers thought that we were not mature enough.,because
44683_1,I spend more time at Penn State.,I have been able to attempt to understand where people are coming from.,as

43228_1,We need to actively seek out new from other places.,the bombing that killed Basim's family will not get forgotten in the background noise.,so
45182_9,"At first, I think they found it hard to get into character.",They found it hard to find something to say.,for

45547_3,Serfs didn't own land.,Serfs gave the ruling party most of their resources.,and
44653_2,What people wear could be a huge part of their identity.,It is important to let people feel comfortable.,and
46502_1,We get so upset about our flag being disrespected.,How do we view this on the respect scale?,so
45469_4,These women were with other women or close family.,"They took them off, did their hair, put on make-up, and put on outfits similar to what non-hijab wearing women wear out in public.",and
46294_7,It is still kind of distracting to me when I am around new people.,because they will usually keep glancing at it.,Nan
44603_1,It was neat to see the other prospective.,"I was put in their position, it makes sense to protest.",if
43162_3,We were presented with data that was shocking to many regarding the number of Americans unarmed killed by the police,We were presented with data that was shocking to many regarding the breakdown of these numbers by race.,and
45193_4,There are people who blindly follow without finding out the truth for themselves.,and making their own assessment of everything.,and
45528_1,They kneel for more than racism.,thats something that I can respect.,and
46265_3,Global citizens it is our duty to find truthful media sources., I believe will not only allow us to learn more about other people.,and
45794_6,We will all die.,we have before.,as
42947_3,it literally destroyed an environment.,I have never experienced the slightest bit of an attack.,because
43849_1,They are immoral in choosing this time to do the protest.,There are plenty of better places to use their fame to exert positive change on society.,as

43396_4,Sam put up the statistics.,It showed more white people are shot by police.,when
46206_4,We would stunt society's growth.,We would stunt our country's growth.,and
42799_3,There was nothing to be done about it.,It was due to the intense fear they installed in the people around them,because

45917_1,He mentioned how sometimes we are in certain situations.,We do not really know what is going on.,when

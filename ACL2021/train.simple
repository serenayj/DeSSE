Sam is more of a preacher than a teacher. This is why I don't think I'll miss a single class all year.
In that kind of environment, people are not racist. They are rather embarrassingly entitled. They feel like they aren't allowed to acknowledge someone's ethnicity. They are afraid of sounding racist or offensive in any way.
It is impossible to tell the tone of the person posting. It is unclear whether they are being hurtful versus playful.
It is only natural. They are human beings.
College students are immersed in a divese environment. It is necessary to keep an open mind. Be careful trying to judge a person's background based on looks.
Your histories are different. It makes me curious.
I do understand why people perceive a tiny bit of racism in sports.
It allows us to form a more nuanced understanding. We can realize that these numbers we hear are referring to real people.
I am an international student from Venezuela. I do not understand football at all. It is not a common sport back at home.
It is evident. Society's influences on the accessible power of certain races is primarily responsible for this mode of thinking.
The city is split into four quarters: the Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Armenian quarters.
At this point in social media, I feel that anyone who puts themselves out there will end up being discussed online. It is a relative news story. People want to voice their opinion.
America can ignore the fact that people have different skin colors totally. Meaning there will be no discrimination or prejudice to different races. We can not stop talking about race.
There is a girl in my lab who is from Afghanistan. She currently has friends and family living there.
I know I will look at this idea in a deeper way since first discussing it. I will appreciate your points.
I would also add. Another thing that plays a big part in this issue is the fact certain sports are played in certain areas due to weather conditions.
Eniola, I think it is very interesting how you said that before coming to the United States, you did not consider yourself to be black.
I really liked how you tied in your own background being African.
I distinctly remember this conversation happening in class. It resonated with me.
Similarly, the guest speaker was a lawyer, a highly respected job. They were with kids and a wife. They were just like an average guy growing up in the United States.
I had a very hard time. I couldn't identify who belonged to what category.
The extremists involved with the Taliban or other similar groups are on the fringe. Extremists do not accurately represent the views of the average Afghan citizen. Average Afghan citizens just try to get by peacefully each day.
This goes with saying the environment of people included.
There has been many events and conflicts now. In the past that clearly shows the huge impact racism has had on everyone.
People tend to believe this about Afghanistan. They are just horrible people who are fighting a war.
I am from a town where a majority of the population is white.
I think 9/11 was the closest thing any of us have experienced in our lifetime.
America is a very diverse country. America is moving towards having more diversity each day.
I mentioned how I was one of the many people. I thought immediately of war. Afghanistan was brought up in class. I now agree, it is definitely not true.
I was confused by this statement . He is an atheist. He does not believe in any God.
It shows what Penn State stands for. We do not agree with such ideas.
Many people like to say this when they are explaining equality. Many also just look at it as empty words, only said to be seen as socially acceptable.
Many people have a strong opinion regarding race. They are not willing to accept that they could be wrong.
This is why hearing individuals' stories, like Rafi's, is paramount.
Personally, at first glance, I would have grouped the two girls togethet. I thought it was interesting to look at it from a different perspective.
I find it interesting. You thought this feeling of discomfort came from a lack of education on racial issues.
I think this is a false perception of what a war zone is like. It comes from lack of knowledge about the Middle East.
I agree. I would have done a terrible job. I would have been terrible at putting people into groups.
It is fascinating to learn how different races celebrate the holidays.
As a Latina I can understand what being a minority in the US feels like.
I also believe it will lead to less discrimination.
We all consciously are the same. We put people into different categories. We associate them with certain things.
What I mean by that is, just look at these students,. Most people would not be able to know what their backgrounds are.
It was said. It can be used for good.
In this video, a student named Jeffton was asked to go down a line of 13 other students. He was asked to group them by where their ancestors may have been from.
I think. It is a solid mix of both. This should not be the case.
People get dumb tattoos that don't mean anything. They aren't alienated for centuries.
What happened in the United States that made it different than the rest?
You do not have any evidence to back up that other countries cultures are richer. Their children are smarter but that does not mean they are happier. That does not mean they are better off than us.
it is not fair to say that you know for a fact that something is better than another. It isn't fair if you have not experienced both firsthand.
It turned out she was actually from Mexico. I was pretty shocked then.
Here's the fact of the matter. Sometimes, Sam really forgets that money exists.
It is imperative to understand a persons culture first. Do this before making any assumptions about what kind of person they may be.
I know not all of them are good citizens. However, we need to understand that a lot of them are working hard every day. They are trying to make positive changes for their country.
I simply had a conversation with my friends the other day. We had a light-hearted argument over the correct pronunciation of the word crayon.
There is a problem with this information tube. It claims to be the knowledge of the world.
Sam explained that the student would have to categorize all the students into groups depending on their ethnicity. If I was the one participating that I would do well.
As for myself, I would have no problem dating outside of my race. I am from a very small town with little diversity.
Last semester I took a kinesiology class. We talked about how the access to a sport like basketball is much easier than a sport like hockey.
However, upon conversing with them it is easy to see. they are indeed very different features from me.
I do want to stress that there is racial injustice all over the globe. There are other places to live. Places offer minorities far less opportunity than the United States.
I have trouble understanding how creationism could be legitimate. I strongly believe in evolution. That verifies my way of thinking.
Race mixing is sadly considered a new concept by many people. This is due to cultural assumptions and ignorance.
By the way. Don't believe is corny .
By not judging others by how they look based on stereotypes, we could learn that most people around the world are the same.
Those dividends being the presence of people belonging to hundreds of religions and speaking thousands of languages. People belong to countless different communities peacefully coexisting with one another as Indians as opposed to as various religious groups or separate communities.
This may help realize. Most people have more similarities than they do differences.
It's impossible to move on from something. There was no closure given. The issue is still prevalent.
I had lost my slight southern twang. I had taken up a neutral accents.
We can never repair the damage that has been done. We have made so little effort to do so.
Remarkably, Professor Richards pointed out in class that in my country the servers or maids usually have darker skin. This led me to evaluate the undertone racial issues occurring back at home.
It has always been a goal of mine to get the best grades I can achieve. Sometimes I'm barely even learning!
Countries have had racial atrocities. Countries protest for equality
I also had this mentality when it came to Afghanistan or other countries located in the Middle East .
I think it has to do with more than race.
Sam touched briefly on the topic. America is a melting pot.
I am referring to the injustices that are so obvious. We are embarrassed to talk about them.
I was actually surprised to see them. They were Spanish.
The concept is the same as hanging out with your friend all the time. Hanging out with your friend causes you to pick up and start using things that they say or do.
What happens if they are wrong?
Some of the people had thick accents that I wold have never guessed. This could give away their nationality.
Its again that difference. Talking in the physical class vs. talking on Twitter.
There are ESPN NFL analysts who've played the game. Some analysts wonder why black players are on the wrong side. The analysts question why white people are never put into question.
People really don't realize that any day can be their last day. People always have the mindset of "tomorrow can wait." Rafi has to live every day with a chip on his shoulders. He isn't guaranteed anything.
Different groups evolved. Groups traveled to different locations. Groups developed a variety of different distinct features.
I mentioned this in my response. I studied abroad in the Netherlands. I discovered European countries have race problems.
What kind of body do you need for basketball?
I agree with this completely. I believe sports are dominated by cultural upbringings.
Growing up, race was never talked about. I grew up in a predominantly white town.
War is always in action. We're not hearing about it.
To me, race is not a big deal. It's because of the kind of high school I went to.
It was also easier for me to look at the photos of the Native Americans and Chinese to determine which was which.
There are many others just like Rafi and his family. They are trying to have a better future and a normal life.
I immediately realized I had been spending a lot of time around my friends from Arkansas. I picked up on the expression.
Many people don't talk about race enough to be aware of the issue
I've been realizing more and more. They do have Asian face features.
Coming to Penn State, I gained a whole new perspective on different cultures, whether it was meeting someone from another state or even a different country.
I really enjoyed that you brought up your personal relationship. I really liked how you said that you got along. You found each other interesting and attractive.
I have noticed that difference in both men including women that are hispanic, white combined.
Hockey is played in cold environments. Most people of black descent live near the equator. There are very few significant black hockey players.
I have a inside look at things. Not many people think about race until later in life.
I didn't mention one thing in my original post. It was 2 Czech women. The women came with us to teach about their country.
Social media platforms provide information at our fingertips. I personally believe it's harder for our generation to be blind to the negative realities of the world.
They know what they know. They are blind to everything else.
This is due to a number of reasons. Not one in particular one. I believe in one of the main reasons. How dependent people are on the media.
Our world is filled with diversity, especially here in America.
In order to move forward, we must shift to a more positive message of equality. We should not dwell on the differences between races.
In my family, two of my cousins are black. One of my cousins is Asian. Another cousin has Down's Syndrome. I have witnessed from my family how people are treated differently via speech. or just in people's actions.
We may think that other countries do this or that. In reality, most of the people no matter where you go are the same.
These reasons are mediocre. These reasons shouldnt be a deal breaker in any relationship. These reasons are superficial.
Hate amongst ethnicities is deep rooted in the development of our country. It probably led to the problems the United States has today.
In America the civil rights movement forced the discussion upon people.
We are a very self centered country all together.
Where is the line between funny versus mean?
The main issue is the ignorance. People are so blind to notice they carry.
Bassim's life was destroyed by accident.
I really enjoyed this lecture. It opened my mind to many new ways of thinking.
In essence, they are putting their lives on the line for the citizens of their country. It is a place that has been engulfed in hate and war for years.
As a kid, this confused me. I don't want our country's future generations feeling like race is an awkward topic of discussion.
I mean initially, when I did think of Afghanistan, I would say that my idea of the country was a lot of dust, war, and bombings.
I agree with what you said here. White guys rarely have an interest in black women.
We NEED to continue speaking about race, violence, war and other entities. They are happening right now all over the world.
Here's the biggest thing I personally took away from Rafi talking. Most of the people that are living in Afghanistan are peaceful and friendly.
This is what has pushed race to the forefront of conversation. This makes our country progressive compared to others.
The United States has an obvious issue. The United States does not recognize that its history is frequently unjust.
This is a pressing issue. Issue that keeping the world even more divided.
I found that very strange. I am clearly not physically white.
They moved down south. Their skin color changed a bit. I totally understand now. Native Americans have face features that can confuse us sometimes.
CNN, MSNBC, and FOX are so arrogant. They are confident in the way they provide news for people.
I believe that these ethnicity check boxes have no benefit whatsoever. I really hope that in the future they won't exist.
Russia is located on the continent Eurasia. Half of it is in Europe, the Eastern half in Asia.
Her lack of experiences with people of other races definitely impacted the way she viewed other people of different races.
The student was trying to categorize them. I was tryng to work it out in my head.
Seeing the struggles of Afghani people really opens my eyes. It makes me appreciate my life.
With the passage of time, the number of mixed race people is increasing exponentially
This was very interesting to see. I struggled within this religious aspect against the scientific proof.
There may be features that they personally do not find to be as attractive when compared to other races. Everyone obviously has a type.
I have also heard a lot of girls say, "I'm not into Black/Asian guys." on multiple occasions.
I think you make a great point. You state that majority of the population is intimidated to speak up about race. They fear that someone else will take their opinions the wrong way. Someone will twist it to something they did not intend.
It is skin tones or shape of the nose or eyes. We all appear differently.
It would be ideal for all of us to be able to travel to Afghanistan and speak with families there. Nonetheless, we cannot realistically do that.
Why would a kid living in Minnesota want to play baseball in below freezing temperatures?
We understand what war is. We know it can be devastating. We do not always grasp the full effect.
It is interesting to learn just how little I really know about the world. This class does that every day.
I also believe war can happen anywhere. That wouldn't change the way Americans are. Why do we judge Afghans and their country by this war?
I watched the video. I decided to comment on it. It is Pay Attention to Distinct Differences.
Racism isn't just an American phenomenon. Racism exists in other countries too.
Hearing Rafi's story makes me want to learn more about how wars affect Afghan people and other people who live in war zones.
This is stating that people believe because you come from a specific place, you must play that sport.
Race is something we should never be expected not to talk about.
The media also has a big impact on discussing race because of prior events like Trump's election, Charlottesville, and the Black Lives Matter movement.
I remember this. One time, I had to fill out a form. When I reached the ethnicity check boxes, I couldn't find a box for Middle Eastern. Next to the "white" box it said this in parentheses. ( if you are middle eastern check the white box).
There was something that Sam said that I have never thought about. Humans are one of the only species that kill our own kind.
Parenting is a factor. Living in their own community is another.
People generalize one race. They do this because of what they were taught to believe.
What surprised me was the first picture.
I discussed the Latino community. It was I have the most knowledge of. I know colorism exists in many other cultures.
It is important that people realize how similar human beings of different backgrounds are. People can begin to realize that one race is not smarter. None is more civilized. None is more superior.
Sam stated that if you hang out with people from different areas, you really start to notice these differences. This helps you to become more cultured. You will stop just seeing black people as just black people or white people as just white people.
Race should not be a reason to reject a chance for a relationship.
I found it funny. Sam displayed the picture of all the cars in a big road stuck in a traffic jam. It's just like we may have all been in before.
They started speaking Spanish assuming she would not understand. She shortly called them out for it.
I really like how you broke down your thought. I completely agree with your comments.
All of the video choices were intriguing. I have a particular interest in the creation of the world.
I really like what you said. I like how you discussed LCT Gareys response to the question.
I think it's important to do things like this to see how other people group people.
Rafi was a guest speaker. He fit the description of a peaceful man who lives in Afghanistan.
This is my opinion. I can see the perspective of the police or guards telling him this. He is somewhat high profile in the society regarding peace during this time with the Taliban in Afghanistan.
After this lecture, I have really taken a step back. I tried to put myself in Rafi's shoes for a moment.
I think that people get racism from old values and traditional beliefs.
In class, Professor Richards highlighted that genetics play a role which is true.
I'm in a relationship now. The boy is from Brazil.
It is similar to what you were saying. It was about being from an area where there are many people of Hispanic culture.
Sam first started lining people up at the front of the room. I tried to guess their nationality. My guesses were solely based off of skin pigmentation.
I first did it around my mom who looked at me sideways. My mom made some joke about being southern.
Here, you pointed out how your father has been a football fan since you were born. This led you to become one yourself, as culturally, so are most Americans.
It is the most ruthlessly pragmatic species the world has ever seen.
They do not want a war and believe in peace.
I realized. If I ever wanted to change these things about me, I would look less like my parents.
I come from a small community in Pennsylvania. I went to a private school.
He talked about the fact that there are real people in Afghanistan. They are suffering from the war.
People are brought into the world as innocent as any other. They only learn hate, stupidity, and ignorance through the words and actions of others.
An interracial couple can be portrayed in a positive and negative way. We have norms and values in our society.
Most of the time, people automatically assume she is white.
My sister dated an African American boy. My grandfather made a rude comment about them dating. My grandfather did not like the fact that they were dating.
It really is a shame. It is sad that this war is getting nowhere.
Logical thinking would lead you to believe that race shouldn't be such a huge issue. Let alone in the year 2017.
I was never introduced to the idea. These children go to school, play sports, and have friends. It's just like I did.
I agree with this. When Christopher Columbus came before settlement, the Europeans immediately thought they were better and more worthy than the Native Americans.
I was very fortunate enough to grow up in a diverse area. I was exposed to many cultures and humans.
There needs to be more discussion. We see certain groups of people. Certain groups rarely date outside of their race.
Hopefully one day, race will no longer be a topic of discussion. Everyone will be truly equal.
After hearing all of their traumatic stories from over the years, I always concluded that all the Afghans in Afghanistan were bad people.
I went through some retrospective.after class. This was about the different accents of the diverse people that I know in my life.
I agree with you. Racism is a huge problem in America.
I don't care about that
Sometimes racial issues or tension are present. No good can come from silence.
Towards the beginning of the video, Jeffton asks Sam, "Can I ask them for their names before grouping?" Sam responds, "no."
India is years behind on accepting the rights of women, LGBTQA, and the bottom 1 %. It is behind on even giving respect to interracial marriage.
Being able to track how genes moved over time is extremely fascinating. It tells us a lot about the history of people.
Our choice is just to start the turning. We need to open the conversation to how skin color is simply a marking.
After reading your passage, I found it interesting hearing your interpretation of what racism is. I found it interesting how similar it is from culture to culture.
It also depends on what time period people were brought up in.
I agree. This topic is very interesting.
Judging a person's personality based on their appearance is unfair to them.
I feel it is the most dangerous. They use race to divide up criminal action.
Similarly, war is talked about every single day. You never really hear the media talking about the civilian people that are getting injured.
I completely agree with that fact. Culture plays a big role in sports. Sports aren't inherently racist.
This is much different than the picture Sam showed us. Afghanistan around the 1960s.
The same thing is true about the United States. It definitely has its fair share of bad guys. The majority of American citizens are nice people They only mean to well.
Some think we talk about it too much. They might be hearing about a certain topic of race. It is constantly being repeated.
I think that if we are all fundamentally the same, we should think in similar ways. We should realize that there is no point in judging people for things that do not matter, like crooked teeth and black shoes with a brown belt.
I think President Barron made the right decision. He decided to deny the alt-right people to come to Penn State. They weren't allowed to speak to the students.
I thank you for your response. It was well done.
Throughout all of history From the beginning of mankind. There has always been tensions between the different groups of people.
The whole continent was built upon European colonial slave trade.
I think. The world would be much better off. Everyone was multiracial.
It's not because my dad taught me that they were. I made this association based on the only stories I had ever heard about them.
I agree with everything you said. I find your point about the news very interesting.
To be honest, I really did not know much about Afghanistan. Sam thoroughly talked about it in class. Rafi was there to explain more about his home life and experiences.
I don't know too much about religion in the past. I find it astonishing how many people died for religion, even today.
That is my opinion. I got it from this lecture.
Afghanistan is a country filled with millions of people. Most of them are not bad individuals.
Many individuals and groups across the United States are extremely racist. Do not accept others that happen to look differently than themselves.
I am not completely educated on how to react to it. Sadly this allows us to be divided within our race. We feel different.
I could not imagine leaving my house and saying goodbye to my mom or my dad every time as if it were really goodbye forever, just in case I am in the wrong place at the wrong time, the way Rafi does with his wife and family.
I always find it intriguing. Sam straight up breaks down that awkward barrier.
Sam has had the opportunity to explore many different cultures. It has helped him understand, even accept all the different people in the world.
I haven't been exposed to a lot of different races. My knowledge is limited past the common stereotypes.
I do agree with a lot of the sentiments in this post.
By seeing the massive amounts of similarities, we have with foreign countries. Our false perceptions can then change. We can then see that these people are just like us.
I think people may start comparing themselves by facial structures in the future. it would be more difficult for people to separate each other by race.
Personally, I see peace as a top priority. I fully respect Rafis position and dedication.
People in different areas of the world are coming together. Having children is on the rise. People are more opened minded about race than in the past.
It was tough to see the numbers increasing in recent years of. Afghan citizens killed. The military personal of both the US and especially Afghanistan.
Sam began class with showing us pictures of Afghanistan.
I say "in the right way" because I feel as if there are still uneducated close-minded people out there in the world. They believe in racist thoughts.
His nationally is also Hispanic. Hispanics are usually only better at baseball. He became a great basketball player.
As an Asian-American I noticed that my family too talk about colorism. Back in their home country, Vietnam.
Families just like mine are being brought up in such terrible conditions. It breaks my heart.
My parents are both Christian. I went to Catholic school. Going to Catholic school may have some influence.
It's easy to see the obvious differences. It's the smaller distinct features that really tell you where your ancestors came from.
I also think that people just have a desire to be part of a group.
Race is sensitive for a lot of people. Asking questions about it can be sensitive. I like the way that Sam says its just the way we are. Differences are important. because that is the same way I feel.
Black people are judged constantly. So are other races.
Maybe, it's a feeling that they just don't relate and click on on certain things.
From what I learned in history classes in earlier years, all humans migrated from Africa. of course this makes sense. it is one thing to learn about something, and another to have the proof before your eyes.
You cannot make someone do a sport.
I found myself picking up some of their accent I found myself picking up their language.
There is a difference in culture and fanaticism. The difference leads athletes to decide which sport to play. I believe it is the major influence in their decisions.
I am not in any way trying to insult anyone. Lighter skinned individuals do have a privilege. They need to be aware.
I agree with what Sean is saying in this video response.
I think some people avoid talking about these things. Talking about these things would require them to admit that those stereotypes do exist.
Racism has deep connection in the US culture. It unfolds many complex issues. I do not agree. It is something that can not be solved.
We were discussing this topic in class and watching the lecture again. I had this sense of maybe we are talking about this more than normal. However, this is something that should be discussed quite often.
He talks about how the world has this white supremacist ideology. White people are all wealthy. White people are all well off. In reality, they are the ones who tend to be below the poverty line.
In my opinion, dating someone from another culture has more benefits.
I also don't understand how one can look down upon another basedon color or heritage. It makes zero sense.
The human body and evolution are both such fascinating topics. Humans have changed over time. Humans are best adapted for the environment in order to thrive where they live.
I really enjoyed hearing from both LCT Garey and Rafi. I think it really gave the class a better perspective of Afghanistan and the people of Afghanistan.
After hearing Rafi speak, I actually had an entire different mindset.
It is the nature of these arguments. They make race such an issue today.
When I was in high school, I played lacrosse. It was a very expensive sport to play.
It starts of by the guy talking about similarities in India and the US. Sam goes on to make his points subsequently.
Taking this class really has taught me. I should not to take everything I see at face value.
I grew up in a town where there were kids of certain ethnic groups. They played sports that a person might not have thought they would. Their opinions were based on their genetic makeup.
Growing up, I was never forced by my family into religion.
One time I met one girl. I thought she was from Cambodia. It was her darker skin. It was her eyes.
remove If you live in Florida, you would most likely pick up a volleyball or basket ball in contrast to other choices.
I've always thought Sam's story about his accidental conversion to Islamic faith was funny.
America has become too politically correct. Americas racial issues have never truly been settled.
I have one specific memory. My group traveled to the city of Jerusalem.
That graph is no longer just a line on the screen. It is not representative of a necessary evil in order to better the lives of the Afghan or Iraqi people.
LCT Garey explains that the Afghan people live regular lives just like ourselves. They had been living normally until conflict arose.
At the same time, I believe that it is talked about too much in the media. It brings so much attention to the news outlets reporting on issues about race.
The majority of white people and black people live in cohesion with no issues. The news finds the 1% that cannot. The news projects it for the world to see.
I decided to watch a clip. It is one of those two classes.
I agree that we live in a race-driven society. It needs to not be ignored anymore. Instead, we need to make a change to it.
It really struck a chord with me. He talked about the inherent friendliness of citizens. They welcome you emphatically to share a cup of tea with them.
It was a great way. you analyzed the a good argument. why race is a big deal in America.
Our skeletons are all made of the same bones.
I did not expect some of them to be what they said they were.
Most of these arguments take place publically for everyone to see on social media.
I believe that genetically and culturally, people as individuals are so diverse. We are far more different than we are similar to each other.
I found this lecture to be very eye-opening. This lecture made me really look forward to the other topics Sam will be discussing.
If they are all qualified and appropriate for the position or opportunity. You give them all the same chance. Then whoever is the best rightfully earns that position or opportunity because they deserve it. Not because of their skin color.
Whatever country you immigrated from were the people you associated with in America.
Brooke, I have to agree with what you are saying. It is more common in today's society for people of different cultures to date and get married. There are still some people out there who think this is wrong.
DNA has spread around the world. The DNA is nearly identical. There are small differences that make us look different. The small differences are from people evolving in different climates. and regions of the world.
I honestly never really gave much thought to what others believed in. After hearing this lecture I really started to question it.
In Kabul, there are people that drive to work. Then they come home at night to their families.
Many people do have racial preferences. People shouldn't not like others because of their race.
The media's biggest goal is getting views. In order to get views, they are only going to show the most dramatic events. They just show ISIS and Taliban members, almost making it seem like they are the only people in Afghanistan.
I think more people need to think like you. Race shouldn't set a boundary of attractiveness in people..
It is kind of hard to think of money. I have a brother who is in the military.
Overall, I was very interested in this clip. I was thinking about choosing it myself. I really enjoyed your response.
You said race has been talked forever in our memories. Personally, I cannot really imagine what that other perspective would be like..
There are REAL people living in Afghanistan with real families and jobs. To think that they have to live in fear every day is truly traumatic.
I have always thought of everyone being unique and different. Thats what society tells us today.
I most certainly agree with you. We must continue to speak about race issues.
The country is poor. There is constant destruction taking place. Is there any chance the country can grow? Can it become better than it is now?
I do agree. I hope to see significant advancements within race relations in America. I hope this topic can be spoken about freely.
That image got me thinking. About Mexican people and people from South America.
The amounts of noncombatants (civilians) who have been killed in wars, throughout history, have always been very high. Innocent people will always die in war.
I feel as though, in the future, interracial couples will be more prominent than the traditional couples of just black and black together or white people being with each other.
People tend to ignore what is happening. They feel no effect on the event.
The guy did group most of the people from South America together. The guy did group most of the people from Central America together. This was      pretty good on his part.
How hidden the issue is in many places around the globe is incredible. do believe that putting a stop to the generalizations of a race and/or culture is a start in ending the race issues we face today.
Looking at migration patterns of humans they moved across landmasses that are no longer close together. People from completely different parts of the world have very similar features.
I was stumped that day. I really did feel comfortable and grateful. I was able to see how everyone was different. Really, we are all the exact same.
It is actually a little difficult for me to imagine growing up in one area. This is even if it were a big city.
People do not differ from one another as much as we think we do.
I think that this post brings up a really good point.
That is what the lesson showed us. We need to do something about it.
I have no idea what it would be like to live in a war zone. I never want to find out.
We as a country do ignore what we did to the natives.
An example used in the article was food.
They should invest some time into getting to know a race that is different than their own. Maybe they could relate and eliminate that subcategory.
I think. We try to be funny online. At the expense of someone else.
The older I got, my opinions of faith changed drastically.
I truly think that the world would be a much better place. We were all exposed to other cultures. We learned more about one another.
Most people would have a hard time telling the differences between the Native Americans and Asians shown in the video. I'm sure that people living in those areas would be able to tell relatively easily.
We know what they are saying. They see everyone as white.
As genetic information moves. People continue to pass down their physical features. This can be tracked down to a part of the world that they no longer live in.
I have always been skeptical of faith. I am more of a logical thinker. This class has really verified the suspicions in my head.
I believe what develops the human being and shapes them is their experiences and mental formation.
Hopefully race can no longer be a topic of discussions once my generation has grown up. I do believe it is going to take a long time.
It should be a legitimate concern or consideration when our government recommends using military force in a country.
After all the origins were revealed, Sam discussed what features on a person's face can let you know what ethnicity they most likely are.
However, just because a country is at war does not mean they are bad people. It is the bad groups we are after, not the whole country.
I believe stereotyping about race is unfair. People could be from any part of the world and look like they may be from another corner of the globe.
Another example he used was wearing a brown belt with black shoes.
I understand what you are saying!
I want to express how everyday I go into this class. I really enjoy it.
This is not necessarily privilege. You can see how easily she can be mistaken for being white.
More people have to be informed of the reality of what is happening in the war. They have to be informed about its effects on people's lives.
I think that people do not give enough credit to those around the world that deserve it.
The example Sam gave in class was that when you go to a restaurant, you normally see people with light skin on the floor seating you or waiting on you. Those with darker skin are in the back making your food or washing the dishes.
I dont know how many years it would take for the world to be multiracial. It is definitely on the rise.
It is all based on what people were taught as children.
I think this point is valid. It is the logic behind many individuals' arguments.
I personally believe. Moving towards a completely mixed race world will eliminate a great deal of the problems that we have across the globe.
Racism in America has always been alive. It has not been seen by people in power. They do not have to see it.
People need to admit they are ignorant.
I knew what racism was. I had some theoretical knowledge limited to the school textbooks. I was never able to talk freely about it. I was never able to get a good understanding about it.
Personally, I am a strong believer that anyone is capable of being decent at anything. They need to enjoy it. They need to really want to be good.
I truly hope that they are having a good childhood although they are in a place of war.
You said that colorblindness is not a solution to race. That's exactly what I was thinking. I listened to Sam talk. Sam talked about how we address race in America. I just couldn't put it into words.
I do not believe that we talk about race too much.
I have a younger brother who is currently in the Marines.
This video especially stood out to me. It talked a lot about peoples facial structures. Those unique traits can help you figure out where their ancestors came from.
Many are fighting. Many are working towards peace. They are not getting there.
People are so dense in the way they understand race. You were spot on. You said that in order to solve these issues, we have to UNDERSTAND.
I went to a predominantly white high school. I was never exactly immersed in diversity throughout school.
Race is a common subject that is avoided. People have the fear of being racist or unethical.
Racism exists in other parts of the world.
I feel like in society today, when war is discussed, people from Afghanistan are spoken of in such a negative light.
I think people are dating outside of their race more now. Love wins.
I have came in contact with a lot. People come from different backgrounds.
This then leads us to believe that. The reason for certain races to participate in different sports could be a cultural effect.
Hearing about the different regions and how they define our skin color or how our noses are shaped made me realize how there is absolutely nothing dividing us in any way, shape, or form.
In other countries people hate on each other. It can be based on what neighborhood they live in. It can be based on who their parents are. It can be based on what kind of jobs they work.
Removing the emotion in order to actually grow intellectually is hard because of the sensitivity.
Sam has a great teaching style. I wish a majority of my classes were taught with this much enthusiasm. I wish there were opportunities to get involved in classes.
I never noticed how diverse the population around us was. I fully put things into perspective how different the facial structures can be and the different eye and nose shapes depending on what region they are from.
I had to go home to ask my parents. I asked them how this was possible.
I also agree with your point. When war or any major event occurs, many people seem to only really care when they have some connection towards it.
I enjoyed that part of the lesson. I hope to learn more like it.
There are Afghan soldiers fighting in this war. They're just like us Americans or anyone else.
It is important to accept your failures. You can learn from failures. You should not push the responsibility onto other people.
I had never thought about race issues as just a big problem in the United States.
I was never a big fan or watcher of sports. Exceptions include the soccer World Cup or The Olympics. I saw sports as a racially diverse activity.
A lot of military strategists and psychologists argue that the targeting of civilians is an effective strategy to win a war.
I loved the way Sam incorporated this segment into that days lecture. It again made me think.
It makes me so thankful. I have never been so closely exposed to the horrific scenes that war brings.
I am not a natural citizen. I was laughing. Of all these people saying they wanted to move out or insulting a nation because some dude got elected.
The people talk about the cultural difference. It is in a positive manner.
Therefore, I have always had this picture in my head. I though of it being nothing but a war zone.
I thought it was interesting that the two girls noses, chins, and eyes were compared. They were clearly different. They were from different parts of the world.
Keeping yourself to one preference is fine. It can also keep you in a bubble.
The capital city of Afghanistan, Kabul, can be imagined as a bombarded place. It has nothing but remains of buildings and mosque.
I think the example you gave regarding Canada and black people is pretty legitimate. You absolutely see hockey is a more predominant sport in Canada than basketball is.
Our society has destroyed our sense of community, acceptance, and compassion to the point that no one will forget what our ancestors have done.
Also, I'm almost surprised that Sam took a DNA test in the first place.
I had never thought of it that way.
Many people might think that we should get over it. If nothing is done on the subject of racism, then there is still a world of ignorance and discrimination.
I never really understood what it was like in Afghanistan with all the war and violence that is happening over there.
Also being from India I took my understanding of this discussion as well. Which is where saying. It could be argued this country was founded on racism.
From a young age we have been pushed into thinking we are all different from one another. No one is really like anyone one else. We are all unique.
Hi, Stephanie. I agree with your statement on how race is an issue here in the United States. It is all over the world.
I went to church for a little while. I would never call myself a Christian.
Twitter and the internet is a great medium if you want a bunch of strangers to interact without fear of breaking the walls.
I had the same thoughts. I thought similarly when Sam gave this lecture in class.
I think it is because that is all we were ever taught in school. We did not question the idea that Afghanistan really could be any different.
We can point out towards slavery. The history of slaves gives a solid answer. Race would be a complex thing in America.
Most of us were fortunate enough to be born or move to America. We have had the privilege to not experience war first hand.
Afghan men and women are encouraged to vote. They do so by dipping their fingers in ink. They can't go to another ballot station and vote again.
I was excited with the opportunity Penn State would give me. It is a large school.
Other countries are also great. The question of which country is the greatest is subjective.
I decided to do my response. I used Matching Ancestor Groups.
Rafi's very own partner was murdered last year. Rafi himself gets death threats regularly.
There's one thing this class is doing. It's making me think.
I think. Race is a very interesting topic to discuss. It is something. Everyone has an opinion on it.
Most people who are in Afghanistan are experiencing war basically in their front and backyards. We are only seeing and hearing about it on television.
I have also felt very uneasy. I am uncomfortable at times when having a discussion about race with others.
However, I disagree on your point. You think the United States is not or can never be the greatest country in the world.
He was unable to explain how this was any different than discriminating against people. He stated only that dogs were too innocent to be treated in that way.
Usually it is just a key point brought up divulging from another argument.
We know that these people live lives so similar to us. It really puts a new perspective on the way that we view the war.
Think about this at the end. Race and color of a person are two very different things.
Hearing about the suffering that American soldiers had inflicted on them was such a shock to me.
I have moved seven times in my life, in five different states.
I do believe economic status also has something to do with it.
This all leads back to stereotyping. Stereotyping is a big part of the war. Stereotyping is hurting innocent people on both sides of the war.
This applies to different countries that are at war. It applies to people from different backgrounds who may be in the same classroom.
Omar is from Saudi Arabia. He has a strong Middle Eastern accent.
Everyone is trying to be too smart or knowledgeable that they forget to actually know something, not just say what they heard.
I agreed with many points. I disagreed with some.
For that reason, I think that the movement towards a less ethnocentric society will happen slowly. More and more young peoples ideas will become the new social norm.
I believe he thought that group was European decent. It is their lighter skin.
I feel as though this question and many others having to do with dating someone of a different race are such a hot topic in society right now.
It does seem that something like this can only exist in modern countries. Wrong speculation can really drive you off the right path.
I disagree with the statement. Racism will be taught not to be tolerated. Traditions will be passed down. Children learn how to treat others based on their parents' beliefs and actions.
It blew my mind. It was something I never really gave a thought to.
Overall, I think that race should be talked about more in general.
Think about your earliest memory. Who was different?
Basing the American population off of the few bad Americans than it would be completely unfair. The same should be said about the Afghani people.
I admit that I can be quick to judge sometimes. I do not think it is right to generalize people and their beliefs by putting them into certain groups.
I liked what your input about the movies and media aspect. That shaped what you thought about Afghanistan and the people there.
It happens when you hit a certain age. Dating becomes a thing that people take seriously.
Therefore, I do not understand. Why people care.
It not only allows someone to hide behind a screen. This allows others to see it. They believe whatever is posted online.
Most kids growing up play the sports. Their parents allow them to.
I do not. I talk to others to be more aware of it.
Everyone talked the same. For the most part, everyone looked the same.
No one can 100% accurately pin point where everyone comes from.
I have to disagree with you on one point.
Sam seemed to think that the girl in the video was going to respond differently. This was interesting to me.
I feel like now I will be much more aware of people's characteristics. I will wonder how those related to the past in aiding their ancestors in their survival.
I'm assuming it's as simple as that.
I'm shocked. We didn't bring this up in class.
I never really thought about why I felt this way.
Discussing race in class, we should not have to feel self-censoring. We needn't beat around the bush trying to get our point across. We needn't worry about hurting any feelings.
I see why Sam is doing this after watching the video. The exercise is cool and honestly funny.
Race will continue to be an issue in our world. It is the sad truth.
So personally the reason I think race is a big deal in our country is this.
It was fought about in my high school. It was debated in my English classes. It is present in a lot of my everyday life. I realize that people of the same race tend to stick together.
As an immigrant, what I love about america is its oceans, its beaches and plains.
I'm a Criminology major. I'm in the final process for the United States Secret Service. I'm willing to risk my life to protect this freedom.
He said that they acknowledge the past. They apologized for what had been done.
This class, in particular, has opened my eyes on my view of the world.
All people are different. Most of these differences are due to where they come from.
I think sports tend to be fair. The better athlete usually gets to play.
America is a fairly new country. America's horrific past has not had enough time to heal.
If he has to, he will use what he learned to protect himself or his Marines brothers. He will do this at any cost.
It's more of a culture thing. It depends on how you were raised.
Are we classist? How do we know the difference?
The more exposure someone has to the sun, the more vitamin D gets absorbed into the skin. They get darker from that.
However, if people took 10 minutes to research and get educated on Afghanistan, they would no longer make those generalizations.
People that were educated on other cultures. They would realize. People from all around the world are probably just like them.
He basically said that if he doesnt continue the work, or his sister, or his brother, who will?
I agree with you. Cultural mixing through dating can be beneficial.
After delving into the implications of it in this post, I think it is just as much an important part of class as the lectures are.
This is something I naturally say. To them and their friends back home, it was so bizarre.
Everywhere I've lived, there has been some sort of unifying culture (whether it be accents or clothing) to identify the people there.
I don't have a bias toward any group.
It would be very different for me. I know my family would not frown upon it. A few of my family members date people of other races and nationalities. They are accepting of it. I know they would be fine with it.
African Americans back then weren't really powerful. People try to do anything to get out of poverty.
I like how you highlighted the population. The population was headed toward a direction of mixed people.
Should we talk about it more?
In today's society, interracial couples are seen much more than they have been.
This is clearly my own naivety. There was never a reason. I didn't need to think too deeply about it.
All those groups had distinctive things about them. The people were mixed.
I believe many issues that exist today would not exist in the future. This is if everyone was multiracial.
That just proved to me that looks are very deceiving.
As it stands now, people use negative reinforcement to talk about race.
The more individuals that are killed increases the number of people increases.
No one is born racist. We share a lot of similarities with one another.
I find it very interesting how you said that you first felt uncomfortable discussing race with others. You were uneducated.
I chose to respond to this. I feel that there is so much to talk about on the subject. I can go on about it for hours. I never come to a conclusion.
Paying attention to these details is vital to understanding different people.
In my eyes, his response was touching.
Many people's ancestors did not live close to the equator. That's why they have a lighter pigmentation. It was passed down through their genes.
A whole country was built on racist principles.
Race is an issue that I think is very prevalent in the United States. People from other countries do not understand this.
People will say Afghanistan is only dust and bombed buildings. You will know that is not right.
Millennials are sometimes perceived as having unrealistic or naive views on the world. They are also dubbed the generation ruined by technology.
People of color have been categorized as being good at certain sports. They are stereotyped as being more likely to advance in these sports. Compared to other ethnicities, like whites
I grew up in the Midwest. I have a strange, long accent that everyone always points out.
I find it extremely interesting to listen to the way that others think. I compare it with my own beliefs.
This picture compared to one of Afghanistan currently shows how the country has fallen into turmoil recently.
Race Mixing existed since the dawn of humankind. Humans used each other's traits.
I will never come to terms with destruction. I can't get over the heartbreak that racial barriers have caused.
I was informed. I learned that these people are really just like us.
The fastest way to get out of poverty was by getting into a sport. That's why you see more blacks playing basketball and football.
This unconsciously leads them to be seen as racist. This is even though that is not the case.
I really enjoyed this class. It was unfortunate that we only had about an hour to hear about such a complex subject
I was the person in white who spoke near the end of the video. I explain why race is different here than India.
When he first started grouping them I thought he put the girls together because they were white.
If I were living in Afghanistan, I would be stressed. I would be worried all the time for my safety and my family's safety.
I had hard time adjusting to the idea of the factual part of science ever going against my faith. I think it really is the person's choice to believe in how this all relates to make it all make sense. We can never know everything.
As a child I did not know there were more than two religions. Finding out how many of other religions there are was very fascinating to me.
War has remained throughout my lifetime. War has remained a constant thing.
My father is a retired US Marine. He fought in Kuwait during the Gulf War.
We are fighting these evil people. We are made to believe that all people who live in this area or have these certain beliefs are evil.
Patriots star QB Tom Brady did something. There are feelings that the consequences would be less severe than a black player.
I returned to school after that break. They told me a similar story. They were hanging out with friends. They used the term you guys.
The question of racism in sports arose in class. I started thinking in more detail. I thought about the racial differences in different sports.
I personally do not think that there is anything wrong with dating outside of your own race.
I have no idea where this mentality originated. This lecture was extremely eye-opening.
Humans want to win.
This limits our chance to really explore our options. As well as capabilities and understanding of the choices we make for our future.
I have never heard of white guys not wanting to date black girls. That just seems so crazy to me.
I love to travel. I agree with you. The world would be uninteresting without it.
Learning about Bassim (seeing pictures of his family, his house), then learning what happened to him and his family was heartbreaking.
People need to realize that it's 2017. The only way to end a problem is to put a spotlight on it.
The demonstration made me recognize the conflict between the two schools of thought.
Race is a thing lowly discussed in Venezuela. Our society is mostly governed by classism.
When LTC Garey talks about the Afghan patriot. It really struck me.
The real facts are that there are families who are trying to live a peaceful life.
People tend to remember things much longer. They read something online that makes them react strongly.
I think the girl who was speaking was spot on when she referred to it as exotic.
You could argue that India has roots based on racism as well. Someone still turned out differently.
Also, I think some people just do it. They are attracted to that person, regardless of their race.
This example allowed me to apply this same notion to other things in life.
I feel. I grew up. I make progression through education. I create a path to be followed.
Personally, I am Hispanic. I have dated white men. Itbecause of their looks and features that are the complete opposite of mine.
Your story about going to China is so interesting. It really exemplifies this idea.
This country was supposedly founded on equality to all. In reality that freedom was only afforded to a small group of ethnicity.
This is all because of the Eurocentric beauty standards. Going that route would lead me to write a four-page paper.
To me, breaking complex concepts down to the core of it makes it easier to understand.
A large portion of African Americans come from cities. Basketball is more available and accessible to play vs. soccer, hockey, and golf.
At the end of the day, what does assimilating to the American society even mean?
It is possible that the race differences started out with different socioeconomic backgrounds. It has evolved into cultural reasons based on what sports your parents and grandparents took part in.
It's hard for a news station to admit they do not know something. Instead, they act like they know everything.
Essentially, they live normal lives besides the fact that they also live in a warzone.
After watching the end result. Seeing who actually belongs together in terms of origin. You can actually witness firsthand. The reason why Sam said no about asking for names.
I do not think. They will be in the majority any time soon.
I believe that societal pressures influence our education perspectives.
I thought it was interesting. Sam was talking about peoples noses. they are shaped different ways to help in different climates.
I loved the feedback given by your family. I am interested in what the exact results of your ancestry.com tests were.
My neighbor is actually working for the Secret Service right now. He is on a presidential detail with President Trump.
America was discovered. Prejudices against Native Americans only followed shortly after.
The opposite can probably be said for other team sports like baseball. Most players tend to be white in it. Blacks may not get the same opportunity.
It is wrong to compare governments. Each nation is based on different cultures and values to start with.
This is the moment where my mind turned. It was when Sam said this. Over half of modern war casualties are civilians.
Overall, I think talking about race and continuing protests for equality is important. It's a right that we should be thankful for here in the U.S.
Become conscious of those different cultures. We could begin to find differences in people we used to lump together .
Trump has just upped the United States' time there. Is that really beneficial to anyone?
We often look past that when we hear the name Afghanistan. This is a conflict zone. In a closer setting, these people are just like us.
In Sams lecture he used hard logic to explain this statement. He is even going so far as to give the class a visual of a DNA test he took, which shows his African American ancestry.
I believe talking about race more in a civil way can only improve our society. I also see why some others may have a different opinion.
I don't know whether this is a gender difference. It could be just the people I've talked to about this. It is quite puzzling.
When these people get into conversations things can become heated. They are trying to be influenced. Race does not affect other aspects to a person. They can turn into a discussion that does no good. and a turn into a discussion that does no good and creates more tension then their was before.
I moved a lot. I noticed cultural differences in places I've lived. Those differences would probably stand out more to you than me. I am used to encountering differences.
This is a result of negligence. We as a country never address the wrong that has been done. Thus we are unable to move on from it.
I completely agree with you. This activity was one of the most interesting and engaging ones we have done in class so far.
In the past people were more comfortable with associating themselves with people of the same race/ ethnic group.
We had more than just our government. A select group of people would have spoken out by now.
This I cannot say. It's just something that I've noticed.
I would like to see sports expanding to different cultures. I would like to see some of the effects it would have.
This relates to the treatment of fair skinned people compared to darker skinned.
It is just not called racismin these countries.
Some seemed to think that white guys are more adaptive to the cold which helps in hockey. Black guys typically have longer legs and a shorter torso to help with basketball.
You make a good argument. The U.S. by far has one of the worst racist histories to date.
The media plays a huge role in this as well. I'm glad you pointed this out.
They explainedthat Czechs hold the Romas (alsofrequently referred to as gypsies) in very low regard. The Romas are heavily discriminated against.
I think this topic should be brought up again. It was only covered in like three minutes of class.
It puts a bad stereotype in our heads as Americans. How a place that has been so war stricken. It could be more similar to the United States than different.
It's sad to think. A lot of people believe that they are all horrible people.
It is extremely important. People who make national security decisions should consider that.
To me it is all about how you personally take the situation on race.
I really enjoyed reading your posts. I really enjoyed your views on the video.
I grew up in a predominantly white neighborhood. I went to a mostly white high school.
Firstly, this is blatant indoctrination. It makes little to no sense.
It was cool. I was getting noticed.
I talk to some of my friends from eastern Asia. They all have generally different dialects.
Many people are even uneducated on where they come from.
I have never really travelled much outside the United States. I think it would be safe to say I am not too cultured.
I don't think that racism is being made more prominent due to recent events.
They do this. They avoid getting a tan.
I am a short person. I wonder how height is affected by different climates.
We have so many similarities to Afghanistan. These similarities are being affected by this war.
Samantha, I too agree. Sometimes we do talk about race too much. It is because we have to.
Did they learn more about each other?
This is the thing. We cannot exactly know. Scientific proof may be part of God's plan. This is my belief.
Do we talk about race excessively?
I'm not sure if I'm making too much sense. I feel like someone will have to understand what I am saying.
He's very new to the United States. He has a slightly difficult time speaking clearly while speaking English.
It has not changed.
The first girl who said her name was named Angie She said her nationality. She was from Cuba. She looked like any typical white girl living in the United States.
Being there is no war here in the United States, we do not see how our military is doing in other countries.
I agree. This lecture really stood out to me as well.
I feel as though this narrative is never really discussed nationally in the media.
He tells stories of meeting all of these people who are nothing like me. He tells stories of young kids who are so much smarter than we are. His stories fill me with jealousy.
I think that in 50 years, there will be many more people who are mixed races playing all sports. Sports will be less dominated by one race.
We are all the same. We categorize people. We believe what we say.
All the students revealed their different background. I was shocked by their backgrounds.
These differences should be celebrated. Unfortunately, some are socially more desirable than others.
I do agree. There is always the exception to the rule in these situations.
Many parents raise their children to believe as they do. They are not giving them a voice. The freedom to build their own perceptions of the world and its people.
Things aren't getting better. It's something we should be informed about.
I agree with you. Most people believe that their different phrases or accents are the right way to speak.
It is true that a caste system existed in India. It has been outlawed since independence in 1947. Those who did belong to the lower castes get special reservations from the government.
I think that African Americans have certain genetics. They allow them to be fast.
This video brings up the topic of dating outside of your race.
Now, I look around. I think to myself. How could I ever have thought this?
Race is definitely not something only the US faces. The US plays a huge role in helping to bring awareness to the problem. No one really wants to confront or admit it.
This is also linked with your thoughts. It is the older generations ahead of us that still are having problems with individuals of different races dating.
I mean we had a black president not long ago. How could race not be talked about?
We aren't anywhere near reaching the level of communication and acceptance that we could ideally be at. I believe that society in general has begun to open up and become more willing to listen to other people's ideas, thoughts, and opinions that may differ from the ones that they were raised hearing.
I remember being with her. We approached a group of my Latino friends.
I had to choose the darkest person in the room. That simple observation was very powerful for me.
Many people are unaware. People choose to turn their heads when they see acts of racism.
This realization really hit me. Sam showed us the picture of Rafis daughters on the screen.
They are worried about what they will think about having a boyfriend or girlfriend outside of the typical relationship norms.
The world needs to continue to discuss racial problems. Instead of arguing, we need to work together to understand one another.
This picture showed three Afghan women happily walking down the street. They were dressed in normal clothes like shorts above the knee.
And to think of sexual reproductionin that aspect, it is very cool to know.
I disagree. I think what divides us is our national pride.
Overall, I agree. I love your post!
Sometimes I don't understand why it isn't the case in the USA.
Moreover, as you said all are equal!
The categories people are put in are pointless. Those categories rarely apply to that person.
Individual sports are an example. There is no racism involved. The best player wins.
I believe that in addition to what you said about the ignorance the people in this country harbor. There is also a prevalent tendency of dividing. As well as separating people into different boxes and stereotypes.
Love is love. People should not subject themselves to just dating people of the same race.
Remember, I choose to go this school. I knew what I was getting into.
Overall, I found this talk to be something fascinating.
We didn't talk about it in the lecture. It would be nice to learn a little about that.
I agree with Domenic. The examples she gave regarding white supremacists are influential.
Anyone who dismisses an entire race fo women/me is prejudice. They should be called out for it.
There is something that separates America from the rest of the nations. We have individuals who are more willing to speak up about the injustices in our society.
It is the only way to be politically correct.
It is this state of being so vulnerable. In this state, the real learning happens.
Slavery followed. The men who could abolish it did nothing.
The pictures were an example of how most people, for example, in the U.S. see all other countries around the world without knowing the whole spectrum of the reality of those countries.
Generations have come before us. They would most likely disagree in the idea of dating outside their race.
I have been to European countries like Germany and Austria. In  European countries there are plenty of white people who look like me.
It is an unfortunate fact. It is true.
Humans can be 99% similar genetically. Conversely, their eyes, noses, skin pigmentation, hair, body shapes, etc., look different.
Regarding India, as Sam mentioned as well. The caste system also discriminated against people of darker skin. It made them easily identifiable to the lighter-skinned, upper-caste citizens.
We are all made of the same material.
I agree that emotions do play a huge role on this subject. It is so sensitive.
Like he said, it isn't until you travel and actually visit those places that you realize the real potential other places in the world really have. Not everything posted online represents their true colors.
In the 1970s when they had afros, it was a symbol of the Black Power Movement.
The main concern, however, should always be American lives.
Our world needs to teach the young to love one another no matter what race.
People judge darker skinned people. It relates back to their ancestors.
In states that are primarily cold, there will be a majority playing hockey or snowboarding for entertainment.
Racism affects a very broad range of individuals. Denying them important rights and removing necessary variables from life is important for them to prosper. Racism is and constantly will be a topic of discussion in America.
I just wished Sam covered the topic of interracial dating a lot more.
When I am contemplating dating someone, I don't really look at a person's race. I see them for who they are.
More races are coming together. More races are having kids together. These differences are slowly disappearing.
If you asked a group of white people you would get very different answers.
I heard the emotion in his voice. He spoke about his family, overcoming his anger, and being grateful to be alive. He put the war into an entirely new perspective.
I believe a similar thing could continue to help with race issues.
I find it interesting. You found this portion of the lecture to be so eye-opening. I reacted very similarly.
To it all together, people are dating outside their race. Fact being that they just do not care about the color of another individuals skin.
He finished grouping everyone. I thought he actually did a good job.
Race is an issue in the United States. I think the main separation lies in the color of skin, not necessarily where people are from.
It's like Rafi said in class. He and most other Afghan people are peaceful people.
The farther north you go, the more white people there are. Therefore, you see that hockey is a thing of whites.
I think you make an interesting point. News coverage could spend air time hosting debates on the latest issues.
It's similar to before moving here. I never really identified myself as a minority or brown. I merely saw myself as Puerto Rican.
Also, I feel that location and culture plays a factor
She stayed in hostels. She traveled cheap. She managed to keep her budget in check.
I agree with many that the country was founded on racism.
We heard Rafi speak about his experiences in Afghanistan. began to understand.
The best solution for this would be for people to be more open. They should make an effort to get to know other people who don't necessarily look like them or live where they do.
I believe it is a big issue. It still needs to be discussed.
I think it is out of comfort. It is what they are used to. It is more than just simply not having an interest in someone who is a different color than them.
I did find it inspiring. I heard Rafi's reasoning behind continuing on with his work. We are in such a time of violence.
I experienced this amiability first hand. It was when I went to Israel this past summer.
I agree with you. We must educate ourselves. We are so quick to judge those who live in that part of the world, or make an opinion on war in general.
If people make themselves more aware of what places like where Rafi's family is from is really like, it will allow more empathy to be realized.
This intimate intertwining of social constructs and racial elements has therefore created the need for more conversation on racism and how it affects people due to its inherent influence within contemporary America.
There is a proper way an American who has not visited the country before would answer
I also enjoy learning more about other cultures and traditions that are different from mine.
Sometimes there is a certain race that overshadows in a sport. That does not make sports in general inherently racist.
I believe that as the populations continue to mix the problems of race will go away.
We've seen it constantly. We've tried to protect our inner communities.
There was the chart that Sam showed detailing Afghan civilians killed. It now puts an enormous knot in my stomach.
He said in India, they talk about race in terms of "colorism."
Those desires could lead people to believe that their group is better than another. Those desires can cause some issues.
I think the topic of interracial couples is a very prominent issue. It is seen a lot in our world.
It could be a physical attraction to someone that appears exotic. He or she has a different race.
It never dawned on me the number of civilian lives war takes.
you don't travel. you just don't know about other cultures.
In reality, we are all equal. We're just adapted to different parts of the world.
I think that people tend to make assumptions about poverty. They expect certain races to be the ones who are considered poor or not well off. all races experience the same difficulties and struggles in life.
In psychology last semester, I learned. People have a natural tendency to blame others for their failures. People give themselves the credit when they succeed.
Hockey players benefit from being top heavy. Hockey players can hit harder on the ice. Basketball players benefit from being taller and quicker.
Maybe it seems that the country is just not financially thriving right now with the war. This makes sense why they don't have electronic ballots.
Over the generations, these second class citizens will tire of being second class. They will start to demand rights and freedoms.
I believe this taboo has been put to rest for people with an open mind. I think other people would never do it.
There's a huge issue with these myths and stereotypes. They grow out of a long history of a limited understanding.
I do not believe we are 99.9% the same.
Sam brought this up in class. It makes us more aware of the issues we are often blind to.
We will never know the truth until we eventually pass away. Having faith in any story is critical in how we live our lives on a daily basis.
Families exist with the same hopes and goals that we have here.
It was devastating to see the bar chart. It showed the increasing amount of afghan civilians killed over the years.
Why does race even matter?
The mixed race will eliminate or reduce racial tensions. It will provide protection from many diseases, both foreign and domestic. It will benefit the ongoing progress of interracial relationship statistics. It will create a safer, more inclusive atmosphere and conversation about race.
There are so many normal things going on in the country. It really is just like here.
I'm sure anyone will catch my drift here. Definitely anyone who is from an upbringing like mine.
He felt. He wasn't given the same opportunities as others.
It was interesting for me  When I saw so many natural citizens. They hated this nation and such when Trump got elected.
Some might argue and say that learning about other countries is irrelevant. We should stay within our region.
I found your response  interesting. I never really looked. I do not noticed that hair types and nose sizes. Those thing can help determine your ancestry.
Saif is from Egypt. Saif is also new to the US.
Obviously a civil situation is ideal. It is not an ideal situation. It can be worth it in the end. It will create significant change.
Most of Sam's lectures have brought up many different points and perspectives on some topics I had only limited knowledge on. This one really changed my point of view.
If my understanding is correct, racism as something against minority communities is more prevalent in the rural parts of America. As you move towards the urban center of the state, you find that people are more open and accepting towards someone from a minority community.
I totally agree with the take home message of this post.
I would guessed the same. I had to group people together quickly.
The core concept of this class is about making connections to and with people. It is about finding distinctions/traits that allow us to figure out how to understand how people other than ourselves tick.
Differences should be celebrated, not washed away.
I thought it was very interesting. LTC Garey from the U.S. army gave a simplistic description about what an ordinary Afghanistan citizen is like.
We are fundamentally the same. We are all able to think what we want.
I think he was saying that it doesn't make sense. That is the way people think though.
I have uncles, cousins, and grandparents who have all served in the military. They always would tell me stories about how they lost someone that was close to them or in their particular station.
I agree with you. Past history may not repeat itself. We all can have open minds. We can be willing to go out and experience things for ourselves.
I felt uncomfortable in the past. I was very uneducated in all racial issues. Race was never properly discussed in school.
Indigenous people from parts of Asia have very similar facial features to those who are from parts of Europe close to Russia.
Sam pulled up an image of Raffi's children in their little pink dresses. It made me realize how little Americans know about Afghanistan.
I found the lecture video, "Pay Attention to Distinct Differences," to be intriguing due to being in college and actually noticing the different languages and different features of people in order to figure out the culture or country an individual is from.
I enjoyed this response. I connected with that video.
I think a lot Rafis discussion dealt with peace. He talked of people realizing the reality of people around the world. This helped them essentially not to judge them. It really helped them not to come up with these preconceived notions that many people hold.
Your example was not knowing you were black. I grew up in Miami surrounded by fellow Latinx people. They all knew I was Latina. I was white with blonde hair. and blue eyes.
But for some reason we as a species believe that we are different from each other.
I have a take on religion other than brainwashing. People need something to help them build a foundation for their beliefs, morals, and values.
You would play this in cold areas. This allowed it to become part of certain cultures.
I agree that the media only shows us the evil, they do not look at the civilians living there or any of the good parts.
Despite this, they are the future of the world. This is just as Sam claims.
In the Latino community, lighter skin is seen as more elegant and clean.
Dating a white person isnt the best idea for them.
We generalize to put people in classes. We are really all the same.
I forgot about their homes, their shopping malls, their parks, their streets, etc. That they are just like ours.
People put race in a negative light. They should actually encourage change in the world.
There are differences in the way we look. Despite the differences, we are all 99.9% the same.
Be kind to each-other. We all have struggles.
The class dynamic revolves around students and how they respond and act. Twitter gives a new dimension to our class. It allows those who maybe would not speak before, to have a voice. It allows them to participate without having to get too anxious.
I'm not sure exactly why this is.
In my mind, Asians were Asians and Africans were Africans.
For the most part, we see white men who don't date outside of their race.
This is not to say all. Many older people are stuck in their ways. They people perceive people of other races.
There is so much more to be exposed to race. It cannot just be learned or improved from just a simple talk of a tiny part of it.
It is no coincidence that both of these countries typically have very cold climates.
There's the exception of 9/11. We have not yet been in the middle of war in our country.
It sounds very dramatic. I know it does.
Only seeing destruction on the news gives a perception of that being what the Middle East is. Its simply just not true.
I am hopeful. This conversation will make people bolder. People will not just do what may be comfortable.
Not at all. Anyone who thinks so is just not educated.
I felt wrong. I did not view or see Afghanistan as a normal place before the war.
It isn't the same thing. I watched a documentary called White Helmets. It pertained to the issues in Syria.
I responded to the video titled Do We Talk About Race Too Much?
It's what makes us each individuals unbound to any set standard of philosophy or political affiliation.
It is not easy to put yourself on the spot. In front of a big class.
The one student who argued that our country was built on racism is a point I can agree with.
War is the most unfortunate necessity. It will always happen. Innocent people will always die.
I feel that there are a million ways to discuss this topic. I'm very interested in hearing alternative opinions.
I am mostly of European ancestry. My grandmother comes from Peru.
There someone just like us give concrete examples of how we are actually all so similar. It was something I believe we all needed to hear.
Your point on the radical minority being the ones with the most exposure. The point is very important. When talking about the news and race issues.
I cannot believe this. People would decide not to date someone because of their race.
I agree with your thoughts. Dating outside of race used to be taboo. It is now changing.
My brother and I had a conversation a couple months ago. A conversation about how race won't be an issue in the future.
African Americans are born differently than white Americans.
It was not that big of a surprise to me. I was shocked to hear Sam say that Rafi experiences death threats. It is recommended he have a guard at all times.
A black male responded that he including his friends were more likely to have hung a poster of basketball players on their bedroom wall. That in comparison to hockey players.
It would be nearly impossible for one race to be considered superior or inferior to another. The world's majority is a mix of various races.
I had lived in southern Virginia as a kid before moving to Ohio.
The middle of the video shows. They were actually from there.
I thought this exercise was really interesting. This exercise shows that it is very hard to judge a person's nationality just by looking at them.
People only started really trying to reform race policy in the 70s. People started reforming race policy as a response to institutionalized racism.
everal studies document that race has been shaped by cultural, political, ideological and legal functions in society.
People are not born racist. They are raised racist.
It is true that you can never truly understand a culture or region until you have fully immersed yourself in it. You can get a better idea than the average person just by doing some research.
I love it. You brought up stereotypes in football.
It sounded like it was taken straight from a movie scene.
I totally agree with everything you said in your response.
Facial features helped him decide what group to put them in.
Being a lower class citizen does not make someone less entitled as a human being.
Truth be told, not having much experience with race makes it very uncomfortable. To talk about  it being it is brought up in the media constantly.
Race is such a touchy subject. Have you ever stopped to think about why?
Samantha, I do understand what you are saying regarding this lecture. I personally believe that race is not talked about enough in the right way.
I try not to ever really think too much about war. It saddens me. Instead of peacefully communicating with other countries, we turn to violence as our form of communication.
I can logically assume that I share other classes besides this one with international students. I am regularly never made aware of such a thing. I am grateful to Sam for introducing me to such diversity within my classes.
After being exposed to that much trauma, I really respect how kind hearted Rafi and his family remain.
All in all, I definitely believe that sports are not inherently racist.
The idea of dating in general sparks a lot of conversation across the board.
But also in that class I remember him showing us a picture of a track meet with Usain Bolt in the lead crossing the finish line. Every one else in the picture was black.
As harsh as it sounds, its true.
Everyone would simply be mixed.
I think the public should  be more open minded. Different races of people getting together. People should be able to fall in love outside their race.
This does not stop the women from using skin-lightening creams. Some even shield themselves in the hot blazing sun by wearing gloves, hats, and long sleeves.
There's the true reason why people are dating outside their race. It has become less of a problem.
It is also interesting that you said that white men objectify women of color because they are foreign to them instead of understanding who they are.
Traveling may be something you are passionate about. Try to set a goal for yourself to go somewhere else in the world. Try at least _ amount of time at least every_ months/years.
For the most part. I think we see these two groups dating outside their race the most. It became a trend.
There would be no way for people to hate. They could not dislike someone based off of their ethnic background. In that case you would be necessarily hating yourself. Everyone is of the mixed race.
I think that everything you stated was put very nicely. I completely agree with your opinion.
Most U.S. media portrays Afghanistans people as extremists who know nothing but war and who hate the United States.
I know exactly what you mean. You said you felt like you didn't have a right to talk about race.
Yes, part of what they assume might be right. Ironically, it's irrelevant to the fact that they do not know.
The students in each group looked similar. Almost every group was matched incorrectly.
It comes to beauty. I feel. It really depends on person to person.
It makes me sad to see how the war is affecting people in Afghanistan.
Sometimes I feel that that fact is lost in our quest for racial progress.
Sam's lectures really open up my eyes to see the world through different perspectives. I put myself into others shoes.
With that being said, there is no correct creation story.
From this lecture, specifically this part of it, I came to the realization that once again there is so much that I do not know.
I never thought of people, let alone people with families and ambitions just like you or I.
All of us here at Penn State want to get great jobs. In order to do that it usually requires a very good grade point average.
I thought about it to myself. I did not really care if he called me that.
This class has helped me. It put faces to these people that we make out to be monsters. I recognize that not every person that lives in that part of the world is automatically the bad guy or terrorist.
Im very open to dating outside of my race. You can find compatibility and chemistry with anyone.
The lesson was a good way to show us. We depend on looks.
This is my personal experience. I have found certain people of all races to be super attractive. I just have never dated someone of a different race.
I think this may happen in the future all over the world once everyone is multiracial.
In order to alleviate a lot of the tension around the issue of race, it needs to be talked about in a respectful and understanding manner.
I only knew of the Afghan people from the American mass media. It was sad to say.
You're right. Everyone has insecurities.
I agree with you as well. I also think that a lot of our perspective on Afghanistan has to do with the media that we are exposed to.
Hopefully, all of us who attended the lecture and watched the video will take that feeling with us into the future. We'll make those decisions down the line.
I would hear bits and pieces of what it said. I couldn't believe how specific it was.
Rafi is bringing it upon himself to make the world around him a better place. I could not respect him more for what he is doing.
The people of Afghanistan are more similar to US citizens than they are different.
It allowed you to learn so much more about the world and war. You didn't even have to leave the classroom.
Do you feel worrisome that this is the case?
The fortunes were small. She still wanted everything that she could get her hands on.
In class this past week. Sam switched up the roles. We spoke about how in real life. Black people with a clean record are less likely to be hired than white people with a criminal record in certain situations.
Many countries are knowledgeable about the United States. Not many Americans understand different countries cultures.
Honestly, it is a little weird to think that. Their country is like ours. It's more poor.
It's because of this. We choose not to see they are the same as us. We act blind to our similarities.
We sometimes do not realize. There are families and children that are affected so much by the war.
The stories were good. I connected with them all of them. It would have been a better experience if he went into depth. Why were we over there?
I think it is very unfair. People to make judgement on other cultures. They have actually learned what they are all about.
The media truly fails to show the most beautiful parts of this country.
What I found most interesting about this video is the deep cultural roots expressed from the Afghan people.
I chose to go back to look at this video. A divorce is something that interests me.
Meaning, why is it that my specific denomination of Christianity is so correct? Why is it that all other denominations such as the Jehovah, Baptists, Catholics and so forth wrong?
It's hard to wrap our minds around the fact. People can live a normal life and have hopes and dreams on the front lines of war.
They wake up. They work. They strive to create the best opportunity for themselves and for their families.
It is very hard to imagine something of this extent happening.
In my opinion, the thought of Afghanistan may not seem real to people. We are not physically living in the country.
the Iraqui person that enlightened us is a true example of this.
That people like Rafi can and have been killed. It was for speaking out against this violence.
LTC (Lieutenant Colonel) Garey is talking to the other men in the meeting. He is told that the Taliban Commander is sitting right next to him on the couching, sharing tea. The Taliban Commander is sharing stories along with other men.
The wife is unhappy. What are the restrictions regarding that?
Sam brought up imagining creating a system of law from the Quran. It is such a small book.
They didn't choose to be born into that country. It is constantly putting their lives at risk. It is causing them to worry about things. We couldn't even imagine thinking about them here in the States.
Comparing the two, his actions seem that much greater.
We do have similar aspects of Sharia law in our country.
When bombs are dropped. The houses that get destroyed. The lives that get taken are from innocent civilians who had nothing to do with the war.
It's not fair. It's clear to see that there are a lot of normal civilians with normal children. They want nothing more than this war to end. They can only hope for survival.
Rafi said that Afghanistan citizens are peaceful people. His job as a lawyer involves spreading peace.
I do agree. This would definitely aid the soldiers success. It would help in completing their assigned tasks while at war.
This was especially poignant. You set back and think about it. are you or even one of your family members going to just invite a stranger into your home, a foreigner at that? Would you be that hospitable?
Everybody is always looking for their purpose in life. Rafi has found his by trying to create peace his country.
The atmosphere felt motionless. Time seemed to stand still when we were lectured about the accidental U.S. bomb that killed family members and destroyed houses of Bassim and his family.
My uncle went to Afghanistan for nine months. I do not believe he saw any combat while there.
We all have trouble forgiving people for problems that now seem so insignificant. He was able to do it.
I think we all know what we call that. It's a dictatorship.
With that goal in mind, I think it is capable to accomplish that. It is capable of eradicating the oppression.
Not all Middle Eastern people are nicer than Americans. It was something important to hear. People with those values, that generosity, do live there.
It helps them reconcile the seemingly vast differences into small, bitesized pieces of information. Hopefully, this makes it easier to swallow and comprehend.
when a terror attack is done by a Christian no one seems to even mention a religion. In case of a terror attack by a Christian it is somehow a mental health issue.
Hello, I also am a speech therapy major. I didn't make that connection at first. It is a really unique thought.
This was interesting. The news media hinders our view on what the other side of war is actually like.
I discussed this recently. There are more interracial couples in today's society. The world will soon become a bunch of mixed races.
This process will not be easy. It is exactly why we need to start doing it now.
We are not being informed of what is actually happening.
Just because someone is associated with Afghanistan, it does not make them a bad person. Because of what we grew up hearing about the country, I feel is where Islamophobia comes from.
NATO requested this dialogue. It led Dr. Richards to Rafi.
We all need to do a better job at forgiving the small things in life. We can lose lights in our life at anytime.
Divorce was not really an option. People were to be faithful and work through whatever issues may occur within their marriage.
There are real people with real families who are being affected.
They church has been incredibly deceitful. They have portrayed the message of the Bible.
It is commonly believed among outsiders of the culture. They are backwards. They have a man-dominated society.
This is important. It really brings a big military operation down to a really humanistic manner.
I'm happy to hear that it changed your view on the Afghan people.
Living with such a childish mindset closes everyone from understanding someone's else drought.
These people use the Bible as a guide. There are millions of pages that tells people how they should live their lives.
In general, war and military operations are one of the most stressful situations that mankind may ever have to face. Seeing the smiling soldier shows the inherent humanity in us all. We are at odds with each other. There are times that we must stand back. try to make the best of our situation.
I cannot agree with you more Brielle.
Hearing Rafi and Bassim each speak about their different experiences on the war and how their lives have been affected truly touched my heart and made me think.
Bear in mind that the Quran is a very old holy book. This tells you that it was teaching people how to go on with their lives more than 1400 years.
I realized that the majority of Afghanistan people are nice. They are willing to respect others.
Things are better now than they were back then. It doesn't mean that discrimination is dead.
This is one thing that I believe needs to be addressed in our country.
When the bible is interpreted as it is stated, to love thy neighbor as one loves thyself, some great things happen such as donations, and different humanitarian projects. When the Bible is interpreted to hate gays and people of opposing religions, some horrible things happen.
Rafi's love for his home, however, is heartwarming.
I am sure I am not the only one. I feel this way.
We have such a skewed perception of the military. Hearing LTC Garey's words about the normality was really inspiring. Kindness of the Afghan people was really inspiring.
9 out of 10 people in a society are heterosexual. The one person who is not is going to be viewed as the one in the wrong by default.
Currently I am a junior. My brother made sure I took this class prior to graduating.
We are not robots. In general, we know that going and killing someone is wrong. Why are we so careless with the lives of so many?
This judgmental behavior is a major global problem. It has had an effect on mankind over many years.
I found Lieutenant Colonel Gareys talk to be eye-opening.
We need to understand the people living in the war zone. We would hopefully eliminate stereotypes.
Things like that, should be a focus. A nation is not characterized just by its political conflicts.
the war in Afghanistan has been going on for entirely too long. what do you do when a country doesn't want to rule itself?
It's easy to talk about what should have been done in hindsight. Raffi ultimately made the right decision to not react radically. He allowed time to heal his wounds.
First, he starts by saying that this idea of soldiers constantly risking their lives and fighting is not true.
There can also be similar conflicts with the other side. These do not have to end in violence.
I agree with you on how the perspective of Afghanistan has been shaped by movies and other media.
I feel that many people including myself don't take the time to notice distinct differences in other people.
I did not realize the specificity of the text. Many people interpret it differently.
One thing I think would be very beneficial for the American society. It is greater understanding of the causes and impacts of wars.
Some would even dare to say this. They shouldn't have been born in a area of war.
I mean how you can truly repay someone after killing some of their family.
But does that mean that all Christians are bad?
It would change my life in every aspect. I think that it would be a positive, really life altering experience.
It got me thinking during class.
They do not actually know anything about their culture. They could interpret something the wrong way. Things can go bad.
We need to hear it right from the mouth of someone that has experienced it. We don't realize it could be any of us prior to that.
I agree. We are blinded by our privilege.
This week I am choosing to respond to the clip "What the Quaran Says About Divorce."
People have always understood people. Shakespearean literature gets a lot of the aspect of the human personality right. It doesn't mean that he is right about fairies and witches and spirits.
You are black. You are driving through my home town. There is a much greater chance of getting randomly pulled over. You have your car searched. you were a white person.
People have the Bible into saying what they want it to say.
A big part of the job is connecting with the local people. It's not fighting twenty-four seven.
Sam pointed out in class that there are many other factors other than homosexuality. These other factors make one unworthy to enter heaven.
Do the people of Iran have the same misconception about Americans that Americans have about Iranians?
What if it were that the person taking the oath does not believe in a god?
I would be interested in what the rules are for women. That do not have a reason to leave their husband.
The points you made about full filling our basic needs stood out to me. Sam talking about it stood out.
They have more manners than us. We are going into their welcoming homes with the thought to kill these evil people.
He won't be compensated for his losses.
It brought up many points. I guess I was aware of them. I never really thought about.
Moreover into marriage. As explained in the video. Men cannot possibly just simply divorce women out of the blue.
I think It is hard to determine all the sets of laws and rules about everything in one text.
The idea of war is not thought about enough. What it means is not thought about enough.
It may be easier to put our minds at peace by generalizing the people going to war against us. It is not right.
They are people just like us. I bet that they are better human beings than what we are.
I took a lesson away from this lecture. You have to take the books with a grain of salt.
I cant say I can do the same for Afghanistan.
I learned about it during my government class. We had a large amount of discussion about the government and religion. We discussed all of the checks on it from the establishment clause to the Lemon test. That is 3 different ways the US government can not establish a government.
Innocent people are being killed everyday. Sam helped us realize in class that its not just the bad guys doing the killing.
After reading that slide that Sam used and interpreting it in a literal sense. Everyone in the class realized they would not be able to go to Heaven if they followed it.
Sam showed the slide the displayed the casualties of Afghan civilians. I couldnt believe the slides Sam showed.
Rafis good friend was murdered. It was for working at making Afghanistan more peaceful.
I think we need more people like Colonel Garey to showcase how that part of the world is not all strictly war and darkness.
What I have learned is that everything is perspective. If you're accustomed to one lifestyle, then it's just the way you are.
After hearing Sam and LTC Garey talk about how generous the people of Afghanistan are. Having Rafi in our class to speak. I realized that not everyone is the same.
I think the media tries to portray Afghanistan as the fire of this war.
Instances like this are exactly what this topic of war affecting real people was about.
I think it encouraged everyone. It helped us become more aware of the things that are occurring.
He told the class this. It really makes you think about that.
The pain, and fear that Raffi experienced when he first learned of his wife and nephews death. The pain Raffi experienced  is a feeling I hope to never have.
He would attend his team meetings. The Afghans would bring gifts. The average monthly income in Afghanistan is $300.
Everyone has their own perceptions of other cultures. It's because of how the media portrays them.
Despite their faith, everyone has different opinions and beliefs. Christian Sharia Law would not be ideal.
99% of Muslims are innocent people. Muslims just want to live their lives.
He will not stop fighting prior to there being peace. He believes peace will always win.
It's unfair to lump an entire country with a few bad eggs.
Rafi was the speaker. He came in to talk to our class. He talked about how the Taliban disagrees with Sharia Law. He said he receives death threats daily. for being an attorney for this law.
Once students graduate high school and move onto college. History of war tends to be no longer discussed. Due to the fact that most students are not taking war or history related courses.
I learned something from this video. The Bible has its flaws. It does not answer every question ever about how to get to heaven.
The media sensationalizes the war being full of evil people trying to do evil things to our world.
But its not okay to leave your thoughts there.
Saying that reverse racism exists is also simultaneously ignoring the bigger issues of real discrimination.
I really appreciated Sam taking the time to speak about what Sharia Law is. He spoke about the stereotypes that surround it.
I believe building a country on slaughtering a different race and erasing their culture. Could be the origin of this complicated issue and a deep-rooted problem that inherited from Greek culture/tradition. Which is treating some races inhuanely. Indeed aggravated the race issue in this country.
I think this initiative is important if we want to help Afghanistan We want to help other countries to get out of their war state as well. It gives us a better understanding of what the loss is in those countries.
I said it before. My dad is a divorce lawyer. He constantly deals with unhappy people.
The radicalization of the Bible by people like BLANK, will never happen in places such as America and other first world countries. The views and people of a modern society would never allow it to control them.
I think it is human nature to want to protect your family in times of danger. It's human nature to just run away from all of it.
I thought it was amazing what Lieutenant Gary was able to share with us.
This far-right, alt-right or extremist group is basically looking for the extinction of every minority group. They see the white race being superior to all.
However, I think when it comes to divorce for any religion, it is a very sad reality.
It was very interesting to listen to the Colonel talk. He talked about how he didn't know much about the Afghan people. He only knew that they were raised in war.
He lost things that he cannot get back or replace. He can't even with time and money.
On the other hand, Rafi gets death threats every single day. He's just doing the work he does in his country. It is essentially promoting peace.
How can we justify losing one life over another?
I do believe that we need to rid the world of that 1% of bad people in every population. All they do is hurt and threaten the innocent.
I couldnt believe Raffis reaction to his family members death.
Dr. Richards talks about how important dialogue is. Especially between military personnel and civilians.
How would they be able to live in such a foreign country? They learn anything about the people.
I didn't think about it like that.
We are taught to hate Muslims and those in Afghanistan. That is what our government portrays to us.
Seeing that mall personifies the mothers that were shopping there. It personifies the children on their way to school.
Dr. Sam Richards adds to the video clip. He adds that they are generous and giving. He has experienced their hospitality.
Any time I heard of, learned about, or saw pictures/videos of the country. I always seemed to be seeing it was just areas of sand, dirt, and fighting.
When we are at least aware and educated, it is easier for us to form valid judgments. It helps to eliminate misunderstanding.
I agree that certain sports are more popular in particular regions. Resources are available. Sports have become a culture aspect.
There is an alternative to just respecting the players for their performances on the court and field. People feel the need to point out their race and how their genetics of background is the reason. They are mainly in one sport or the other.
My dad would be my biggest hero if he was doing the same thing for America. My dad would be my biggest hero if he were in the same position.
Something sparked thoughts and questions in my mind. It is the idea of military reform.
I dont want to make any assumptions. It tends to follow that whenever I have discussions with individuals who have actually read their religions texts. They are usually less radicalistic about their views.
I find some members of my family really do pick/ choose. They choose the parts of the bible to follow.
We are all the way here. We are in the United States of America. We are unaware of what is going on across the world.
I thought of Afghanistan before this class. It was just a place on a map. It was a place we've been at war with.
I believe forgiveness is not just a one time deal. You choose to forget what a particular person did. You choose to be okay with it for the rest of your days.
I would say it was an eye-opening class. It makes me really think about racial variation and immigration.
Black people and other minority people are given less opportunities and treated unfairly. The topic of race will never die.
I used to admire Germany very much. I used to think that Germany is the best nation in the world.
That was the first time I heard about Afghan people in class.
Death threats are hanging over his shoulder. He manages to fight for his people. I can't say I would be able to do.
To value one race over another is so ridiculous.
No one ever thinks about the numbers. American troops are killed. Thousands of Afghanistan troops and innocent civilians are bombed and murdered each year.
I know it is out of my control. Business and self-interests are part of war. I still believe that we should find a way to help without turning the country into a war zone.
Most civilians are unaware of how our military is running. They don't know what is being instructed by troop leaders.
We have a clouded image of the Middle East. There's been nothing to show us what life is like over there.
Many innocent Afghani's lives are put in danger every day. This includes Rafi's.
Sam brought up the point. It is almost more of who is more right than the other. It should not be the case.
I am glad that I was able to be better educated on the military and some of their training purposes.
This anger makes me glad about it. The United States unleashed hell on the Taliban.
The photo of the smiling soldier was nice.
The war in the Middle East doesn't just involve soldiers. It's involving the lives of innocent civilians.
I could not imagine Rafi's circumstances. I am thankful for the chance to hear his story. I see what he does to promote peace.
At the end it is all about survival. You will do whatever you need to do to ensure you and your loved ones are safe.
She has plenty of stories to tell me about Dubai. All the things expected of women adds to this man dominated society.
God wants us to be happy, especially if said partner was abusive.
Our country was built off of slavery. There isn't an equal playing ground today.
The stereotype that all soldiers are on the front lines just isn't true. Even when they are outside the fence it is rare for them to see contact.
I really liked the way Sam stated this. War isn't just this thing that is out there.
I lived in India for about 7 years. I could distinguish between not only where a person came from, but to a certain extent, what religion and ethnicity they were.
By seeing differences in others, it can help stop racism at its root.
No one deals with family being separated well. No matter the religion, divorce is always such a sad topic. Divorce is hard to cope with.
There was a map on the screen to locate where it was in the world. This exercise showed that it was more than a location.
He pointed something out. Despite living in a war zone, Rafis daughters have dreams just like anyone else.
You raise a good point. It is upsetting that the culture maybe too welcoming for Americans. I agree with your point.
It really does make me question. What Bible are you reading.
I only hope that more people leave these stereotypes in the movies, tv shows, and news. Instead try to learn about other people by experiencing it first hand.
It showed to be detrimental to his job.
Like Rafi had discussed, simple dialogues and understanding the other person are key in propagating peace and ending war.
I was the one who does not see. It's because of my lack of understanding about the situation.
A soldier is able to do this. Anyone else who is not in a stressful war type of situation should be able to follow.
When we see or know people who are impacted by these terrorist attacks in Boston, France, and 9/11. It can be easy for us to generalize. To direct our anger at entire groups of people that have no association with these terrorists.
Innocent people are effected by the war. No one seems to care.
I always used to believe that being a part of the military meant that you would constantly fight for your country. Thus would have to do whatever necessary to defeat the opposition.
When thinking about it, I could not stand up for what I believed in. This was even without the consequences being real.
People need to accept that people are always going to have differing opinions. Tolerance is the key.
From what I learned, these are every day civilians. They are just doing what they have to to get by.
money does not have to stop you from learning about the world.
This man was able to find humor in a dark time. He used it to motivate his fellow troops.
Our generation needs to be more aware of the damages being done with war. We have grown up always knowing of war.
In reality, its not just soldiers dying.
I would like to respond to the Who Are the Afghan People clip.
Sam altered my thoughts when he showed a photo of something as simple as a traffic jam and said "Look, just like everywhere else."
We all should know why we are doing what we are doing.
During this class, I tried to put myself in the shoes of a person in Afghanistan.
War happening in Afghanistan is just some distant thing to us. Either we do not understand it or do not care. Its easy to just forget about it.
Consider the real people that are on the other side of the United States. We can help reduce this hate with actions. We should try to take actions that dont damage these ordinary peoples lives.
I think that this is something. It can be experienced more in the older generations.
The unique opportunity to listen and learn from Rafis story is something I will always be grateful for.
It is very easy to disregard bad things happening around the world. They aren't directly affecting you.
The world needs to stop being shown as such a negative place. It is not as bad as it is portrayed to be.
Martin Luther King, Jr. wanted to change this. Many others wanted to change this. They started the movement.
I agree with what you mentioned on your post. We tend to forget that Afghans are real people just like us.
I agree. It is very easy to forget what is happening half way across the world.
I think it does a disservice to them. It does a disservice when it comes to being honest with ourselves.
South Indians have smaller noses. Their skin color varies greatly.
This huge value of Christianity seems often to be forgotten. It is taken over by judgement.
Sam said their are very similar books. They just have different prophets leading their people.
Not all people in the Middle East involved in the war are terrorists. They're not all trying to harm American soldiers.
Each dash represented different people dying, from civilians to military officials.
There was no way in hell that I was coming here on my own. I grew up poor with drug abusing parents.
Someone loves trying new foods. I think it was great. His family is trying to incorporate the Afghan food into their cooking here.
It's hard to imagine. All this is worth people losing their lives.
I also agree. Open conversation between Afghans and Americans is important.
I also felt inspired by his bravery. I found myself reflecting on situations in my life where I should have stood up for what I believed it.
As soon as you hear personal stories and see real images of people from Afghanistan. Your view on the war is instantly changed, even slightly.
It was torn away from him. It was very tragic. It is nothing short of truly tragic.
Someone experiences biblically sinful emotions such as hate. They tend to justify those feelings through Holy Scriptures.
I agree with all of the points that you made.
There could be a bomb in these streets that are crowded to the thousands with people. There is going to be a lot of civilians hurt.
Due to this fact, a lot is left up to interpretation.
In addition to that, I want to talk about why race became an issue in the past. It all starts with the case of racial tension in communities Ferguson and Missouri.
I do practice Christianity. I used to be an atheist when I went into high school.
I had never truly seen what Afghanistan looked like. I had only seen only images of war torn cities or pictures of the desert or mountains.
It is really a complicated feeling. I saw the pictures of women's clothing style change.
I agree with your statement. Afghanistan is generalized as a country of violence and hatred. It is one awful group who is controlling the country.
The internet is a great example of what anonymity lets people do.
Years ago, change was a hard thing to accept for many people.
They only show the terror of what is going on. It puts the picture of this awful place that only revolves around war in people's minds.
In today's media driven world, we are often given only glimpses of reality.
There may be a disconnect with the events of violence. We do not hear it from someone who experiences it first-hand. It is crucial for everyone to stay educated with the affairs of our government with it comes to fighting in different countries.
War is a business. I feel that at least the military personnel should be guided on the cultures of Afghanistan. Children were shot. Children were doing a smoke cleansing. would not have happened.
I was happy when Sam finally asked Rafi to talk about it. He stays in Afghanistan. He chooses to not have a bodyguard. I was highly curious. and Rafis response did not disappoint.
On October 7th, 2001 the United States began a bombing campaign on Taliban controlled Afghanistan. They brought in ground troops. They aimed to seize control of cities.
the war was actually brought to the US. I think the majority of the US would be against the war.
You may spend your life in one area. You never see what other things are out there. You will probably be more close minded than the rest of the world.
I really enjoyed your response Jingxin. I felt that I could really relate to it.
They do all the things we Americans do.
I think you brought up a very good point about stereotypes.
I had a similar experience when I visited Israel.
It is affecting everyday civilians tragically. Something needs to be done about it.
I believe Sams goal of this lecture was to open our eyes. He wanted to try to change this from being the first thought that enters our mind.
They were not there for the trip. This helped them to get a better understanding of Jamaica.
It's thought provoking. It's cool to hear that you came from a class with only 130 students.
I showed them sams video. they kind of had the same reactions I have had. Its just so interesting what we don't see or know.
It's hard to develop a sympathetic perspective on this war. It's not until we put a face to the strangers.
In that setting, people often think that race is talked about excessively.
In the video, Colonel Garey tells the class about how in Afghanistan, before discussing any business they all sit down and drink tea for about an hour. They talk about their families and daily lives.
Innocent people are being killed. They think that they are being threatened. Low-key getting other peoples oil.
That I should not and cannot simply be complacent. With the information that is presented to me in school.
Sure, we are Catholic and are told to forgive. We are also human. We find it hard to forgive those who anger us.
This makes me question. What it means to be an authentic Asian?
The American public needs to see. There are families that parallel our own living in a war zone.
It was really interesting to see it. He was going to talk about that.
Religion should not come into point. No good person wakes up one day wanting to kill in the name of god.
We use computers and high quality technological instruments to vote. These people are voting in a process You would probably see it back in the 1700's. The first presidents were elected.
By being diverse and learning about other cultures, we better ourselves as people. We can better those around us.
He was a normal man, with a job, wife, and kids. He was coming to talk about how Afghans are people just like us.
There are many violent, evil people living there. There are normal, happy families who live there.
This definitely was an eye-opening lecture. I'm glad that this discussion was brought up.
From my perspective as an American this war is justified. This war makes me glad to be part of a country that will descend upon anyone that attempts to bring pain and suffering into our country.
I think this anger is what leads to a lot of the hate and aggression towards Muslims and Middle Easterners. That has been visible in recent years.
400 lives will never be the same.
It was alarming to hear from Rafi. Some people in Afghanistan cannot see a future for themselves.
It saddens me to know. We are hurting innocent people everyday.
I agree with you. The number of mixed race couples will definitely continue to grow in the upcoming years.
Lieutenant Colonel Garey showed another photo during his talk. It was an Afghanistan patriot during a military operation smiling.
That doesn't mean that everything is okay.
I believe. Knowing the culture showed the civilians. They were there to help. They care enough to learn the language. and culture in order to help them.
I learned about their perspectives on the US and the war. I thought their perspective was really cool and eye-opening.
It makes me wonder. Homosexuality was focused on so much out of all of those actions. I have a feeling. It might be due to homosexuality being the minority in comparison to heterosexuality.
I never knew that it said specifically. Who would and would not be going to heaven.
Prior to this class I have never thought about the country.
My impression about this country has changed. They gave their speeches in our class. I watched the video about Afghanistan in Quiz 1 resources.
Notice my use of the word organized.
We should not let religion dictate our morals and view of the world.
We don't want to see ourselves as aggressors in this situation. That might actually be the case.
These reasons are why it is so powerful that Dr. Richards actually brought in the guest speaker Mr. Rafi.
When he was explaining to us that most people have a twisted perception of Afghanistan. As a constant warzone of hatred and fighting.
I then thought. How many other innocent people has our government accidentally hurt.
Through adaptations, Native Americans and South Americans developed other different traits for survival. They still share physical features that are subtle enough. They confuse one who has never examined different people closely enough to differentiate.
Some radical people do terrible things. It does not justify condemning an entire religion.
In lab this week, we compared what happened to Basim to the 911 attacks.
I learned from his photos. The Afghanistan voters after voting would dip their fingers into an ink well. It was similar to a I just voted!
In this specific video a student tweeted a question. It asked What thing did you learn while in Afghanistan that shocked you the most?
I spoke to my grandparents about this topic They are very conservative. They are traditional in their thoughts.
Sadly, they are the ones who are being affected the most by these attacks.
This is the life we have. There's no changing that.
I couldnt agree with you more on this type of topic.
Because of prior reasons of some Afghanistan people, Americans categorized Afghans as all being terrorists and bad people.
Multiple countries are using their land as a battlefield. They use it to settle their disputes.
Major issues like divorce along with homosexuality left to people to understand on their own, discrepancies are inevitable.
The story was about the young children. They waving the sage around military soldiers. It was very unfathomable to imagine.
I think that to maintain a dialogue we have to uphold racism for what it was historically. We should not throw the word around. We should not put it in terms of reverse racism.
You normally didn't see people who did not fit the classic white ideal. It was a rarity in my hometown.
I began to do research on this thought. I knew I was extremely uninformed.
Rafi's daughters are in the middle of a war zone. He is forced to live a life around this war.
When I was younger I would attend church with my grandparents. I never fully understood what we were talking about.
The video was the most interesting. Sam puts everything with Afghanistan into perspective.
How could that be? In reality women are oppressed. Women are forced by rule of the Taliban.
Truthfully, before this lecture, I don't think anyone realized the pain and suffering. Some innocent people go through it during war.
I felt helpless. I do not know politics much. I do not understand the necessity of wars.
I was most struck by Rafis bravery.
Even within Christianity, it is a fight of different ways people interpret the Bible.
The Quran and the Bible echo many of the same ideas. There are only really minor differences coming to the mainstream population's attention. This is thanks to biased media and government propaganda during the War on Terror.
The founding fathers thought the separation of church and state was a good idea. If you show preference to one group over the other it will cause conflicts.
There are so many misconceptions and false notions revolving around the civilians and everyday people of the Middle East. It makes it hard for Americans to believe they are all anything but radical.
We can take away from this story the importance of learning another person's culture. Understanding their thoughts and actions. As well as the importance of simple communication.
This trend is slowly changing. It's not nearly fast enough.
I think that an important lesson from Basim. Sometimes being hateful will only make the situation worse.
Honestly it sickness me that the United States fight wars. At the expense of innocent Afghan people For over 30 years without any valid excuses why were they there in the first place.
That is an extremely aggressive preventative measure to continue taking. Is it worth it?
Why are we allowed to get pissed? We're doing the same thing to other countries.
This is all to ensure the wellness of the children and the prosperity of the family.
I think it is very important. We should be able to connect with people across the world. We all can get a little more knowledgable. We can be less closed minded.
Lieutenant colonel Richard Garey deployed himself in Afghanistan with many of his troops. He knew that there is a large chance of no survival.
Finally, here's my and my sister's take on the topic. We are totally open with the idea of a mixed couple.
There is often a misconception about what the lives of both US soldiers/ Afghan soldiers are like.
I find that this message would be much more powerful. It will show and influence individuals who are here in the US. They will have a better understanding of what is truly happening in foreign countries.
I agree with you completely on the fact that sports do not really involve race. Or the economic differences between them.
Everyone strives to be a good person, even with things like divorce.
In my opinion, this is a very interesting way to govern your people.
I think this is a very important lesson to learn.
He then asks the whole class if they are any one of the things written in the bible. Every single person raised his hand. This only made Sam's point drill deeper into our minds.
We are too shy to initiate a conversation.
Something so complex as war is fought for many reasons. The war effects almost every person living in the country.
I have never heard anything like it. I have never seen anything like it. I am interested in trying it.
Psychologically speaking, people are much less likely to harm people. They feel a personal connection to.
When discussing war, I agree. It is a concept many Americans and some others cannot grasp.
Caroline, I found response very interesting. I completely see where you are coming from.
Soldiers should expect to get much help from people. They're speaking a language. The citizens don't understand.
I assume I didn't really think about the consequences that war brings to these people who do not really want a war.
They do not want the war. I am pretty sure that no one anywhere would like to see in their homelands what is happening in the Middle East right now.
Sam Richards said that you cannot stay in an angry dark place. It ultimately destroys you.
I never really had an image in my head. They are people just trying to live a normal life while they are surrounded by war.
Civilians and officers have been killed, and are being killed, every year. This number continues to add up.
There is a small likelihood of that happening in America.
Getting to hear Rafi talk in class and seeing his innocent daughters was an eye opener. It certainly has at least some of the students of soc 119 thinking a little more about the war in Afghanistan.
The media does play a huge role in this.
Sure, people may get jealous of the way others look. They think this other person is better looking.
You wrote a compellling response. I identified with many statements you made.
I agree. This is the first step to making America a more comfortable space.
All the religions have the same essence. They all encourage being a good person.
In my life, there have been things I have felt strongly about.
I've always been interested in the war.
Young black men were shot and killed by white police officers. It triggered intense social commentary. The government hasn't figured out a solution for those cases.
They believe that their sin does not count. They feel they can choose which sin is worse.
In American, the media depicts Afghanistan as a poor, rundown country. All Afghans live in poverty and hopelessness.
Most people wonder why African Americans are dark. That relates back to their ancestors as well.
There are people in America who want no part in war.
Forgiveness to me is something that is beyond us as humans.
You do not see a lot of newspapers publishing stories about those families. They have to live through the war circumstances.
There are individuals who want nothing to do with it. They are scared to leave their homes.
The Lieutenant Colonel explained to the class that it is not constant fighting. He was often times engaging in politics with the people of the opposing country whether they are civilians or military leaders.
We were showed images. We were told stories of the terrorist groups. They have taken over the country.
The media has implanted the idea in American citizens' minds. All Muslims and people from the Middle East are bad people. It could not be further from the truth.
We have these expectations and thoughts. What was the reality?
I used to think of it as just unnecessary. It is a means for people to fight for power and expand their greed.
To make the claim that not talking about race will defuse the issue of racism in America proves just that.
I assumed that it would be more strict. I thought that it would be unfavorable to women.
It's a point of view that was truthful and honest. It compares the expectations vs. the reality of who the Afghan People are.
Christians would still not vote for a pro lgbt bill. They thought it went against their religion. People use religion to base how they feel about certain things. People would base their decision on religion whether it be correct or not.
How would I live every day? Another country's military walked my home town streets. They frightened me with war.
A lot of these same people have only ever read the Bible (or other equivalent religious text) a couple times, if at all.
I think it is really important for more students in the United States to have opportunities like this. It is really eye opening. It shows the actual costs of the war.
I agree that this class was extremely valuable.
We saw traffic jams. They're much like the ones I sit in when I want to travel into New York City.
I didn't really think about civilians being attacked either. I wish we could do something.
Is that what we are protecting ourselves from?
Just like Christianity, Islam is a religion. Islam has a set of beliefs and rules to live by in the Quran.
While there is so much debate about gay marriage and gay rights in the United States. It is shocking that all of these other unrighteous acts are largely ignored and not debated.
I believe that they are using religion, God, and the bible. It is an excuse for their hatred.
It was something I knew was going on. I never really understood the extent of it.
I think his experience shows how powerful forgiveness can be.
We use the New Testament to govern our people. There would probably be much debate.
I guess I just don't understand why many Christians I know bash and judge others for sinning. Judging others is a sin.
It is really unfair. I feel bad towards them.
I think that we should take a step back. We should reassess ourselves like humans.
Traveling does change the world at a subjective interpersonal level.
Why should we pretend that it is?
It devastating to see. People of Afghanistan lost their lives due to cultural misunderstandings.
They fail to mention the casualties of innocent civilians. They fail to mention the fact that we have invaded someone elses home.
Can't overlap wars in general.
The one that stuck out the most to me was Tuesdays class. It was with Mr. Basim Razzo.
White people were actually using Indians and indentured servants as slaves in the beginning. They saw how strong and nave Africans were. Europeans decided to make them their new slaves instead..
We really are blinded by privilege. We don't realize these things in life.
That's what I thought before hearing what LTC Garey had to say.
Rafi lives in fear. He receives death threats from the Taliban. This is due to his work.
This lecture reinforced an idea. Everyone has a different way of interpreting/ responding to text.
Why didn't we just take Iraq's oil? Why didn't we claim Iraq and Afghanistan as our own?
It was hard for me to grasp this until this lecture. Sam did a really good job of providing real life images of Afghan society like Rafis family. Sam provided real life images of the traffic jams in Afghanistan. Sam provided real life images of the Kabul city shopping center. hat make this more real for people on the other side of the war.
The Bible does not accept homosexuals. People ignore many of the other things that the Bible states are sins.
No one should be coerced into religiously following the word of the Bible. If that is not what they believe in.
I personally cannot relate to the feeling of living in fear at all.
They are easily convinced by prejudice voices. They ignore truth and reality.
I grew up with Chinese neighbors down the street. They are practically my second family.
Bassim's story is just one of them. I'm sure there are many others. That is just unacceptable to me.
I have only traveled outside of the United States once.
We can see how these two sides conflicting will turn out. We look towards ISIS and the Middle East.
Being a (white) woman from the suburbs of New York, I grew up with a very biased perception of Muslim people.
He has already lost his best friend. He had to see a picture of him on the screen of in remembrance.
I even find it difficult to read the New Testament. Sometimes the stories seem hard to relate to situations in your life.
With that being said I also agree with what you said about going with whoever side has the most power.
A case is when a mentally unbalanced young white man sits quietly. He killed nine black parishioners. It eventually triggered black peoples emotion.
I always remember people saying that the United States had a separation of church and state. I never really knew, however that there was an actual clause in the constitution that made it mandatory for there to be separation. Yet there is a reason I put "mandatory" in quotes.
All the rest is interpretation. It's important to keep a specific line for these. Otherwise, it is hypocritical.
Religion becoming law would never work without an establishment like ISIS forcing people to follow it.
This trip really opened my eyes to different types of people. It opened my eyes to different living conditions that I did not truly anticipate.
It's easy to look at other countries. It's easy to see their flaws. It's easy to believe there is no way we're similar to them at all.
That's not what Islam is all about.
I grew up going to Catholic school. I did not like it at all.
Different people have different cultures and ways of life. Therefore, it's important to not make assumptions or judgments beforehand.
He described the people as very generous. It made it all seem very real to me.
The Christians killing for their God are not seen as Christians in my eyes.
I think a lot of us are blind to war. War does not affect us. War affects others.
Is marrying another women not violating that same rule?
Something happened to him two years ago. Life goes on. Everyone should realize that.
Seeing images of families, we realize they arent that different from us.
Viewing pictures online or reading articles about different places around the world is very different than actually emerging yourself in their culture.
When the Lieutenant said that the people from Afghanistan were welcoming and invited him into their homes for tea, I was just as shocked as you and many of our peers were.
I was a younger student of religion. My parents always harped on me to read the Bible.
I really enjoyed hearing about your take on war affecting real people.
This is one of the causes of the ignorance. It has led our country to be so full of hatred for different groups of people.
I also think that there is a misconception when it comes to the people living in Afghanistan.
There are many figures throughout the bible. There figures committed some horrendous sins. The figures were converted to Christianity and forgiven by god.
On the contrary, they make Islam sound ugly and horrible. This diminishes all of our hard work as Muslims to show other people around the world that Islam is a peaceful religion. It was never about oppressing women not violence.
Put yourself in their shoes. Think about what it would be like to have to live in constant fear. It is very eye opening.
This has been one of the longest running wars in history. It is not over yet.
The statute must not increase government entanglement with religion.
So many people have phones. Communication with other people around the world has never been easier.
It is rarer than not to have connections like the one Sam has with Rafi. I think it should be up to the media and our government to show US citizens what is really happening in places such as Afghanistan.
I thought this video was really interesting as well. Being in America, we don't really learn about the people living in the war zones.
He showed us the Kabul city shopping center. It's a mall that resembles the ones that I frequent here in the United States.
Seeing a fraction of the real life in Afghanistan, made me think about my own life.
The way he explained his experiences and reasoning behind the things that the military does. It really changed my view.
Terrorism doesn't come from religion. Terrorism comes from selfish people. They believe that the whole world should be as they prefer it.
Innocent people on both sides of the war die. This war is happening on the other side of the world. Oour soldiers are dying too.
Rafi spoke on the war in Afghanistan. I gained a plethora of knowledge on the topic. I completely changed my base outlook on war.
We mentioned something that was skipped in class. We talked about getting divorced because you fell out of love with your spouse.
I went back to Christianity. There was problems in my family. I started praying to solve them.
The number of Afghans being killed keeps going up and up.
It is more of just a guide on how to be a good person.
I have always had lots of comforts. I never really thought of them as privileges.
He looked at gay people. He said sorry you're just not getting in.
Everyone has different experiences that make them see the Bible in different lights. Even the smallest details can be interpreted differently.
From Basim's perspective what happened to his family is a lot like what allegedly brought America into Afghanistan.
With all the violence you would think there was a way to help. It turns all of Afghanistan into a war zone.
In class I learned about all of the types of people who would not make it to the golden gates.
One uses the Bible or whatever religious text you choose is valuable to guide your own life. When one tries to generalize it to an entire society,  a lot more issues arise. Especially issues that is not homogenous in its religious preference.
This guy in the photo is smiling. He seems to be joking with the rest of his fellow soldiers.
LTC Garey could get away with it. He had the rank and pull to do that sort of thing.
I grew unfortunate. I spent many years traveling different countries. When I revisited them, common stereotypes about those countries had certainly corrupted me.
I believe too often we look at soldiers who just want to go overseas to fight and kill people.
To me it is inspiring. The epitome of one man making a difference.
The war is affecting not just those in the United States. It also affects the others on the other side of the hatred.
American people read the Quran. American people listened to Afghan people like Rafi. They would learn that there are similarities between religions.
It's necessary for us to travel. If we can't do that, research and really learn about other countries in the world.
It is unfair to think one way about something just because someone told you it is true.
Real individuals from Afghanistan solely work for peace. They get murdered for doing the right thing.
I agree with what you said. People interpret the Bible in different ways.
Sam then makes a joke or two about sodomy. This was an attempt to lighten the tension in class.
Actually, it happened that two bombs were in my neighborhood.
In my opinion, Islam and Christianity are opposite sides of a coin. They are made from the same material. They are still worlds apart.
They are both tragic. It is really hard to compare the two. They are on totally different scales.
This portion of your response makes me realize how differently we value information as people. This truly is fascinating to me.
Americans could be contributing to the fear the civilians feel. We could create the hostile environment that they have grown up and live in.
The war has been there for too long. People are not even aware of the cause of this war. The global interests involved in it.
It was interesting to see the pictures. There were different cities, malls and Rafi's house.
We learn to use the language. It was obtained from our living environment. It is used to meet and communicate with others.
After the lesson from Rafi, I really think that we should challenge ourselves in daily lives. You should have conversations with people you know and you may not know.
Seeing his face. Being able to communicate with him over Skype. Was even more eye opening.
They do not know how good life can be. They live in such a horrific environment.
Dialogue has always played an important role in our life.
Those stereotypes assign better or lesser images regarding different races. Tensions between the better and the lesser lead to discrimination.
Rafi says if he or his brother or his neighbor or sister could stop fighting. Rafi wonders who will then who will continue to fight for peace in Afghanistan.
Of course, the western countries allies, who are more moderate should. It was demonstrated by Lt Garvey, Take military actions trying to respect the Afghan culture. Protecting real people.
I could not agree more with what you said.
Hearing about the bombing of Bazims house was both disgusting and alarming.
I see the light in which Sam tried to discuss this. The overall assumption about their culture still shines brighter if you ask me.
We work hard to provide for our families. This is no matter which country you are living in.
It's quite hard to classify him as European since he looked Asian. Many deemed him European. One may argue that he is European since Kazakhstan is considered by people to be a European country. This is quite intriguing. because only ten percent of Kazakhstan is in Europe and the rest belongs in Asia.
I did not know that there was more to that quote.
You have to choose it every single day.
As Americans, we should be ever vigilant of when our rights are being violated. To not be lulled into a false sense of security by religions that media attempts to paint as docile.
War is a business. The main factor is false news.
You said that you found it interesting that American are physically similar to Asians. Americans and Asians differ in traditions.
I was shocked when he read the rest.
Forgiveness is the key. It unlocks the door to move forward.
Its not a coincidence. Stories like Bassims were not present in mainstream media.
Afghan people are in the crossfire. This is not because there is something at stake for them. It is because we do not care about their lives.
Many people in American only know Afghanistan from movies. What they see on tv and social media.
From my experience, everyone is extremely welcoming at meetings, festivals and cultural nights. You are an outsider to the culture.
Of course, the initial logical idea would be to pull the troops out. Would you run the risk of another ISIS happening in another country?
This soldier used to think what people and the media had said about Afghanistan and Muslims.
War impacts everyone differently. I personally do not agree with our governments desire for constant war. The government lacks a comprehension of its affects on the American people.
He proceeded to tell us that forgiveness was a crucial aspect of life. Without it, one would be mad forever. One may be unable to move on in life.
There is a lot of light to be shed on the actual people living there. They are so generous.
She knew that the Bible didnt have all the answers. She questioned it a lot.
He explained. There was a bombing at the mall. He went on to show us photos of his friend Rafi and his daughters.
The response seemed less than accurate. It was a little bit insulting to civilians.
It is nearly impossible to follow every law in the Quran and New Testament. For at least me, it seems that way.
It is interesting learning about Afghanistan and their culture. They are normal people like us. Because of a certain group, they are hated upon. They are treated badly.
I think it is important to show the civilians who are truly being affected by this war.
It was used as a moral guide. It was to help lawmakers determine what is the difference between right and wrong.
I was raised to love and appreciate everyone I meet. They treat me with the same level of respect.
It is interesting to see how easy or emotion-based divorces are in pop culture, movies and everyday life.
Many of those people, especially white, don't understand. Avoiding the conversations about race only makes their lives better.
Rafi has two little girls living in this war zone. It is perpetuated by America.
That is certainly not something that I would expect to see from someone who is moments away from an incredibly intense situation certainly not something that I would expect to see from someone who is moments away from an incredibly dangerous situation.
We just want to push the blame.
He made me ask myself what drives me. I had the same answer he did.
I will admit it. I have never read the Bible. I don't claim the faith of Christianity.
Does this ability to divorce earlier in Afghanistan mean that women have more freedom there?
This discussion served to remind me. I am lucky to live the life I do.
We are constantly forgetting. Afghanistan is a real place with real civilians. They're just like us.
America is portrayed to be the freest land in all of Earth. We came to learn that there are some ideas that contradict that thought.
Over the next weeks or so, I observed her. I realized that I could see how her ancestry made her the way she was.
How could someone take religion, something with extremely non violent ideals, and turn these words into volatile acts?
I have not read the whole Bible. I do believe that divorce is mentioned as being a sin several times.
They come to learn that they are also just people. They are living and trying to survive in a war zone.
It is always hard to understand why dialogues, negotiating, etc.
I do not think Sam was correct in his teachings. If you practice any sins that you are not going to Heaven. The Bible does mention several times how those who repent. Ask for forgiveness will be able to go to Heaven.
I completely agree that race will also be discussed in the United States. It is embedded in our society.
Everyone in the world has his mentality/ outlook on life. The world would most certainly be a better place.
Ahmadrafi shows the world what the Islam teaches.
I causes them to easily be corrupted. They believe the idea of a pure, protected life regarding everyone.
It is very interesting the differences between divorce in the Muslim religion. Compared with what we are used to seeing here in America.
Education is the first step to fixing this problem.
The Taliban, as well as our American troops, have taken over what they used to know as their towns, homes, community areas, et.
How long until our freedom of speech and right to a fair trial by jury is violated?
After the bombing he was numb. He was angry. After several months he started to forgive.
The word racism itself has gotten mixed up with other adjectives that assist in defining racism. They do not fully define it, like bigotry, prejudice, or ignorance.
I agree with what you said about having a biased perception of Muslim people.
We are putting ordinary peoples lives in danger. We need to consider what our actions will mean for them and their families.
It is a shame. It is the honest truth.
The Bible said nowhere to kill innocent black people. That's how he perceived it from what he thought he read in the Bible.
Hence, somewhere along the line, more melanin was added to their skin to protect them from too much sun.
It is unbelievable that we, as a military, still are stationing ourselves in Afghanistan.
At the end of the day, I hope that people will become more aware of living communities outside of our own.
It was also intriguing to learn the perspective of the civilians in Afghanistan from that story.
When the little kids were blessing the soldiers, as a practice of their religion, the soldiers shot and killed them. They were unaware of what the boys were doing.
Race is highlighted in sports. Race is highlighted in political systems. race will always be a topic in the United States.
People deserve the right to choose how they want to live their life.
I grew up in a very white area outside of Philly. I had never been exposed to their culture.
Sam said was war isnt just this thing thats out there.
Afghanistan is a very busy country. Many of the photos that Sam projected were of busy streets and nice malls. They look similar to ones we have been in.
This broke my heart completely. It changed the way I think about Afghanistan.
I went back inside to tell someone about the incident. They informed me about it. He was simply a police officer.
If they opened their eyes, they would see that they are wrong. Our religions are similar. There is no need for the extreme hate or violence.
I was aware of this ugly truth as Im sure most of you were. I think it is always important to hear about it first hand. Be reminded of it in order to provoke change.
25,000 Ukrainians per day were dying. No one was speaking about it.
He is a man. He wanted nothing else other than for him and his family to be happy. He worked his whole life to get to that achievement.
I completely agree with what you said, George.
You will hear a lot of people make statements about wanting the world to just get along.
It was a group trying to antagonize the United States. It was not an entire country.
I liked how Sam brought all aspects into this lecture. He showed both sides of the war.
If a foreign country came in and accidentally bombed my house. Killed my love ones. I do not know if I would be able to have the same strength that Basim exemplified.
The media is most people's only window into what is happening around the world.
Students wish to speak. Students share their opinion. Students can just easily log onto their phones. Students type what they wish to speak.
I found this lecture on war in the middle east to be one of the most interesting, thus far.
Affirmative action gives minority students a better chance at receiving an education. Affirmative action helps to increase diversity of students at a university.
I think that military personnel should be more informed. They should know where they are going.
You mentioned it. They often portray a skewed version of reality.
He was making the best of his situation. He was cherishing every bit of it.
I was really glad to hear him bring this up to explain to others. I think this is something that is often misunderstood.
I like how you ended with What the world should be doing is restoring dignity and stability to Afghanistan. The world should be helping them to rebuild their society to what it once was.
I agree with you. Gaining knowledge in other religions would completely change the way people with different beliefs interact with each other.
I cannot even imagine living in fear my entire life.
The media in our country does a great job. The media makes it look like we are only fighting bad people whenever we go to war.
I definitely think more students need to take part in conversations like these. We can rid ourselves of preconceived notions. We can have a better understanding of the people in the world around us.
Do you say you are authentic? You grew up in Asia.
We often see just numbers and charts of casualties. We forget that the death of 1 person affects everyone around them.
Negotiations and talking will help the US troops understand exactly what they are dealing with. It's not simply bad guys vs. good guys.
As I got older I stopped going to church. I started recognizing the science behind earth's creation and why things happen.
I believe it is very important to travel the world. It is very important to become exposed to different cultures.
He showed the picture of Rafi. I wasn't expecting to see him standing in front of the class a few minutes later.
War is messy. Innocent lives will be lost.
I myself had a specific image of Afghanistan in my mind. This is from watching the news. This is from only seeing one angle.
Most Americans know about ISIS and the threats that they pose. Due to their reign, many other important factors are being overlooked.
We were told not to eat anything that was offered by the locals.
Nicole, I really enjoyed reading your post. I completely agree with your opinion on this topic.
If this is the criteria for being authentic. Then what about American-Asians?
The world is not as negative a place as it is portrayed to be. People from seemingly different cultures are more similar than perceived.
However, we are oblivious. It is going on in our own country with Christianity.
He compares the similarities between Islam and Christianity a certain way. It really astounded me.
How could we expect this to stop. If nothing is being done to inform the young people of their and their parents despicable acts?
It is limited. I should treat it as a resource to understand the basis of certain issues. I can further my knowledge about them. I want to continue through my own investigation.
I have often jumped to the conclusion that the Afghan people are different. I felt they could not possibly be like us.
This did baffle me. I do often associate christian beliefs with republicans. I never really would question if someone said that.
I feel like your last comment. I am utterly terrified is one of the most important responses to the beginning of sharia christianity in the United States. That is what many of the people looking to form this Sharia Christianity United States feel about sharia law in the middle east.
For us, the war has defined Afghanistan.
I thought this question was great. I believe people in America don't really know whats going on in Afghanistan or the Middle East in general.
Rich said that it was their form of polling process. I was actually taken back. The process is so different in the US.
You said that you were not sure what the point the Lieutenant was trying to get across. I think what you said you hit it spot on.
This was evident by the story. It was told by the US officer.
Obviously, it is not always up to the man to decide.
I heared about Rafi Nadiri, his two daughters and wife. It made the people on the other side of the war so real.
A lot of people, me included, should get more involved in being aware of why our country does what it does. We should get involved especially when it involves the lives of so many Afghans and Americans.
The image displayed in Israel is that all Muslims are unfriendly. They hate all Jews, which I am.
My dad was a cop for 25 years. He was constantly watching the military channel. He forced me to watch war movies with him.
It is the way they have adapted to where they live and such. I think the world will soon adapt to having more people of color.
There's another change the American government may need to create. Inform soldiers about the culture of the war zone they are entering.
For many of us, the idea of war is what we see in our minds.
That perception affects the way the American public views Afghanistan.
Rafi put his what drives you response into perspective for me.
In a sense, you have to blame the person not the religion. A person does wrong in response to following their law.
Just through knowing of my girlfriend's relationship with her husband. I can see what people are talking about they say man dominate a lot.
After this class. I found out that in Afghanistan women could get divorced after four years. If her husband goes missing.
They are being judged by others. These people face bombings. They fear for their life. Movies display the country as a desert. is what changes the perception.
Ukraine had a similar holocaust. Russia created a massive genocide of Ukrainians.
What does it mean to be American? What does it mean in terms of race?
There are two parts of racism. They are prejudice and discrimination.
It acts as our moral guide in everyday life. It helps us to live our lives in the best way possible.
We understand what that are going through. Maybe we can be better informed about the war.
I have not done anything about it.
I've been thinking about the role the US plays in Afghanistan.
We don't realize how often christian beliefs and ideals are truly pushed in our society. We must take a step back to really realize it.
Their kindness make the war looks even brutal.
A girl came up to me one day. She told me that many thought she was Indian. She was not.
It is incredibly important to understand the history and ideologies of other people in order to fully comprehend complicated situation. Example, what is going on in the Middle East.
The way he spoke about the people of Afghanistan is the best I've ever heard anyone talk about them. That's truly sad.
The life of a solider is accurately depicted in this part of lecture.
I never thought about it this way. I think it makes a lot more sense.
It is surprising to know. Most Afghan people are still kind and generous to Americans.
I can't imagine everyday living in such fear.
I agree with you. One of your points that really stuck out to me. You're glad. We live in this protected country. it's hard and uncomfortable knowing that it comes at a cost.
I am not defending the other side of a war by any means. It struck me during class that even military personnel can have a false pretense of the other side in a war.
People think that the Bible should be taken literally. It is Gods word. We should do what it says.
I agree that it helped to hear his perspective. He is someone who spent so much time in Afghanistan. He interacted with so many people there.
At least for now, hopefully Sam opened our eyes. As the future of this country, we can be a change. We can do more good than harm.
There's another point I'd like to highlight. It certainly feels weird. LTC Garey had to teach the class that Afghan people are like American people.
We may not feel the immediate effects of a partison, conservative Supreme Court today. It will have lasting effects on our country.
With this in mind, I wonder. Is there a better way to raise awareness of individuals  in the US?
Eight years on the Bible has been read. I now consider myself an Agnostic.
The children in Afghanistan are born into a war.
We set religion aside. We really look at people as equals. We should know. Treating people fairly is a step in the right direction. and loving one another is a step in the right direction.
I definitely encourage to anyone that is reading this. Embrace a journey of exploration somewhere different.
He showed us things we see in everyday life.
I always wanted to come here to Penn State. I was a child.
It was really assuring to see. People like Rafi go through their lives normally. They have great families in Afghanistan.
As with LTC Garey, his cultural ignorance prevented him from being able to complete his mission.
I completely agree. I actually wrote about the same concept from the same lecture!
The media also must change. They need to show the good parts of Afghanistan, not just the poor areas and the bombed areas.
It's difficult to hate on a group of people that we feel like are us.
The Army/VA helped make that happen. For that, I am eternally grateful.
In short, I am very glad we had this talk. It was informative. I only wish it went into more detail. I only wish it had less blanket statements.
Most people tend to believe what the media say about other country or nation.
I thought this was effective. we all have heard about Afghanistan. we don't necessarily know what we associate the word and place with.
He made it seem very generously warm.
This miscommunication could have easily been avoided if the soldiers were aware of their cultural practices and religious beliefs. Instead, this encounter ended in the deaths of a bunch of children.
No one is better than another just by the way they look.
Seeing the places that Afghans frequent showed me that their lives are so similar to mine. They go through the same routines as I do.
I  see this in the heavy amount of racism. Racism occurs in my town.
Some Americans don't experience desensitization in the same way. Americans instead have this idea that all Afghans hate America. Afghans are Taliban sympathizers. Afghans are involved in fighting the war in some way or another.
This is the same in many thousands of soldiers. They are in many other countries around the world.
I heard my friends talk about how much they missed their homes. It made me wonder if it really was all bad.
Regardless, it might be surprising. The organizational structure of both has become similar.
It made me wonder why we never see this side of Afghanistan.
Sam pointed it out. There are Christians who interpret the Bible differently than I do.
I agree with you that money is a constraint to traveling the world. At times Sam talks about his trips. Sam assumes everyone has the ability to just travel often.
Exploring foods in a different culture is an amazing way to learn about it.
It's more subtle. It exists though.
African American history classes or history classes are put in place to educate students about racial issues and conflicts over cultural differences.
I knew that Sharia was associated with the Islam religion.
I see this happening all over my town. I see this happening in their political views.
There are people who aren't changing. They're not are not becoming more progressive.
The Afghan security forces commander captured the man. Colonel Geary went to visit the command posts. As part of his rounds for the Afghan security forces to talk to the suspected commander.
However, this degree of personal hospitality does not seem as apparent.
The few extremists are the ones causing the hate. We blame it on entire groups. We expect everyone practicing said religion to be just as extreme.
I think this lecture opened up the minds of many students. It enabled me to see different perspectives.
The war in Afghanistan has been going on for nearly 16 years. For most of us in this class, this is close to our whole lives.
People already understand. There are hundreds and thousands of various races in the world.
They want to enforce their horrible views. They need something to justify it.
They know he will enter the mosque. He will bomb himself. He will kill all the people.
I agree with you on another point. Personally, after seeing Mr. Rafis' family photos and Mr. Rafi in person, it made me have actual feelings towards the people in Afghanistan..
I took this question a step further. I began to ask myself, why is Christianity in general, so right? Why are all other religions so wrong?
It surprised me. A complete stranger invited LTC Garey in their home for tea.
I feel like so many people want the American dream. Because of this, I believe America is just superior in so many peoples eyes.
But through Rich sharing his experiences, it was the exact opposite.
That's what surprised me most. Raffi spoke about the young soldiers coming into the city. Raffi met the young boys with incense.
These children have no way of knowing anything different. As Rafi said, they were cut off from the internet. They are deprived of their only way to gain knowledge of their unknown.
I can only give my evaluation to a country or a nation. I really learn how this country or nation is.
I think that the opportunity to talk with Rafi helped to show all of us the seriousness of what is happening.
When I think of Afghanistan, I have no clear image in my head whatsoever. A few words like War, Middle East popped up in my head.
I know most people wouldnt. Thats just the American culture especially on the east coast.
Communication and trust with those in the country you are stationed in can drastically help acquire information.
In high school I had a great opportunity. I was part of the Model UN team in my school.
Further more, in classrooms throughout the country. Young students are constantly being taught about racial issues of the past. They automatically have the idea installed in their head that the nation was built off these issues. They still currently exist.
A group of Christians interpret the same line in the Bible in many different ways. They apply it to their life in different ways.
Islam shouldnt be portrayed as a religion that diminishes woman.
This experiences completely changed my life to be better.
He believes they are some of the most warm and welcoming people he has encountered. they would open their doors to strangers. They would lend their hospitality to them.
It made me a little sad. He compared the Afghans to Americans. He said how most Americans would never go out of their way to invite strangers into their homes for tea.
He does not care about his personal security. He doesn't care about the death threats he gets. He believes what he is doing is right.
Other Christians interpret the Bible differently. They believe in peace and praying.
I think it helps people who are religious find some sort of appreciation of this other culture. Most people perceive it as bad or evil.
Thousands are civilians trying to live their lives normally. Their lives are in the center of war.
I agree that you will not understand how it is to live in a place like Jamaica. That is true if you go stay in a resort that is set up to mimic the American life. That way, you attract more people.
I agree completely. It is important to learn more about other cultures.
Friends, family, they are all affected by war.
Without forgiveness, many people would continue to live an angry life. This does nothing but hinder that individual. It hinders the people around them.
This war has gotten to the point. Not much is being done to benefit anyone. It is harming civilians and soldiers on all sides.
Being able to see the effects of war, on both sides of the war, was very eye opening.
Even amongst my own family there are many differing ideologies. To propose one to be strictly better than another would start quite an argument and conflict. Have a central governing figure do that, and the repercussions could be drastic.
However, we could not make sure if the resource of the information on main stream media is believable or not.
I was talking about this in my own response. I feel extremely disconnected and uneducated about the war in Afghanistan.
The lecture I have chosen to write about was War Affects Real People.
It truly sickens me hearing about accidental bombings on civilians houses. The lack of news on the fact that it was a civilian's house. Rather it is played off as just another bombing in defense of our country.
Many people pick and choose certain parts of the text. Many people decide how they want to interpret it. Many people push it onto other people.
I did go to church. All that was ever reiterated was how forgiving, loving, and sacrificing Jesus is.
Tensions with Afghanistan have been high very long. We are taught to hate the country.
No one wanted to talk about it. To this day, a lot of people do not know of it.
Society looks at the Islamic religion. They think that they're people are radical and oppressed and forced to live by the rules of the Quran. Obviously it is not the case.
He showed me a video of Iran. I could see how beautiful it was.
I did not realize how many things were considered sins. Even when they are conducted in a minor way, they could inhibit you from reaching heaven.
I think it takes time.
The fact that he has an entire family at home. He still puts his life on the line to make a difference for his country is amazing.
I think it is hugely commendable. He continues doing what he does despite the threat.
People love to put our voice out there.
I cant help to feel sad when Rich mentioned how most citizens dont want to be at war. They would just like to be at peace.
When you see the way people look differently from each other around this area, you can't help but wonder how appearance can be so different. We are all the same internally.
People being classified for certain sports. Based on their race or ethnicity is questionable. I believe that anyone is qualified and capable of playing a sport. If they have intentions to succeed.
This specific lecture was an amazing opportunity. I will definitely never forget it.
I feel like not a lot of people are educated on the affect that the war has on civilians.
Everyone should try to see every individual as who they are. This should be the case no matter what they may have heard from other people.
Many white people do not enjoy having discussions about race. They feel it will tie back to white people in a negative way.
Many of the killings were a result of strict bible interpretation. I found this to be extremely interesting, yet confusing.
His perceived idea of the Afghan people was somehow brought upon him here in the United States. That's just like every other person here.
I think this helps people gather where others might come from. You will also notice that these people are most likely interracial.
I am still not very educated on every culture. I think that my view has changed.
Fornicators, Idolaters, adulterers, sodomites, thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers, and extortioners are all regarded on the same unrighteous level as homosexuals. That is according to this passage Yet the U.S. government has never had a say in whether or not oral sex, for example, is legal.
I chose the video What Drives You to Do What You Do?
We've had conversations about the Middle East. We all owe it to ourselves to enhance our education on the topic.
I heard LTC Garey express the exact opposite in his experiences. This was the refreshing take I was looking for.
Being this prolific in identifying peoples origins, I came to Penn State. I thought it would be just the same.
This means that a lot of things are subjective. They vary greatly from person to person.
It was interesting. Sam brought up how different people interpret the Bible.
He shared that he lives his life under constant threat. He often fears for his life.
I can already tell that soc119 is an eye-opening course. It contains  life changing material.
I never really thought of the things this way. Sam gave me a new outlook on religion. I learned about beliefs across the cultures of different countries.
The race who lived on this country first are barely around now.
I think with 911, US military did not fully think about our actions when we went into Afghanistan. Instead of just ridding of the enemy, we ended up killing and bombing hundreds of innocent civilians including Basims home and family.
Yes, a great deal of soldiers see combat. There is also a portion who have different roles and experiences, however.
Hearing the word Afghanistan, our mind definitely jumps to negative perceptions about the country.
He has a family at stake. t includes two young daughters.
I think that lack of cultural understanding has caused there to be so much conflict between the US and other nations.
We don't know anything else. We need to look for it.
I always hear people say terrible things about Afghanistan.
Its truly scary. It's horrifying to think about.
I think family is the strongest part of anyones life. I come from a very supportive/ loving one.
I really appreciate what Rafi, LTC Garey, and Dr. Richards did. They showed us the other side of war.
Are we using the excuse of solidarity just to benefit those who play with our minds, with the only purpose of fulfilling the desires of their pockets?
LTC Garey said he thought the old man offering him tea was trying to kill him. It hit home to me.
I thought that was interesting. Whether we choose to admit it or not, many of our laws come from the Bible.
Afghanistan has traffic jams and malls. Afghanistan has everything we have here.
It's what Sam said. They have the same hopes and dreams as us.
I agree with your stance on 9/11. The event of 9/11 has caused many people to create stereotypes.
I find it astonishing how we don't treat all the terror attacks the same. they are done for one purpose: to impose fear.
It is like Sam said. Men and women are fighting for the freedom of people. They hardly even know.
Keeping church/ state separate is essential to the success of a nation.
By understanding each other, we could eventually work together to solve issues that arise.
People have confirmation bias towards their own beliefs. It is easier to scapegoat the problem than to sit down, digging deeper.
Prior to that, I have always been neutral. I was in the unknown.
In reality, most wars happen due to the fact that groups of people have different ideas and morals.
Due to this, however, he is targeted by bad people He has received many death threats over this.
Sam even said that this story was not reported on in any US media outlet. There are hundreds of more stories like his.
He said it took him aback.
Society seems to put war in a corner. Society only sheds light on what we want to see.
The information that makes Americans look bad will usually be voided from the broadcast. Americans will never know about a 9 year old girl who died in an American bombing. Americans will never know about  a bus of innocent civilians getting hit.
In light of this, I was inspired to extend my understanding on certain issues. I understood that it is my responsibility to do so.
I think it was also very interesting to hear how LTC Garey talked about the people of Afghanistan. Clearly LTC Garey was trying to understand what life was really like for them.
They are there to find information and protect people.
Many people view all people from there as violent killers. They are not.
There are new discoveries and inventions. Younger generations are more freethinking. They are willing to accept change.
Indeed, Afghanistan is not a wealthy country. It remains in tension right now.
I think sometimes war is a scary word. It scares people off.
I believe that Islam takes good care of women. People perceive Islam in a wrong way. Extremists are not doing any good.
The news did an okay job of covering the war when it first started. Now I feel like there is less and less coverage of what is actually happening over there.
Today, we aren't learning about the war.
It all comes back to them picking and choosing. They choose which part of the bible they want to follow.
I think that it is just so crazy how there are people out there that want to make this country a Christian nation. That completely contradicts the Establishment Clause. The way the Founding Fathers wanted this country to be set up.
Whether we did so consciously or not, Islamophobia existed. It was hyped up by the media.
It's hard to really put these numbers into perspective for a war. It's happening halfway around the globe. We only see the war through mainstream media.
When he said this. It really hit me how bad things are in Afghanistan.
What Mr. Samiudin Rahin were doing in promoting peace/ helping afghan women was astonishing.
The human nature of wanting to be right drives people to levels of hatred and bias. Those do not belong in this world.
The sacrament of marriage is a special thing. That bonds two people.
I completely agree. It is hard for Americans to visualize what is currently happening overseas in the foreign lands.
One of the things that Rafi made clear was that his wife has asked him to stop. Who is going to work toward peace?
The majority of Afghans are trying to survive just like we would.
I wonder how many people have been in the same situation he has. I wonder how they reacted.
The Muslims that hate and kill people. Think it is because it is what they are supposed to do as well.
I tried to listen very carefully. Rafi was speaking about his life in Afghanistan. He spoke about the work he does in America. I couldn't fully grasp the meaning behind why he does what he does until I rewatched this video.
Going into this class, I knew that the Quran and the Bible were very similar. They were interpreted a little differently.
It's wonderful to be given the opportunity to see things from another perspective.
Not even people from the U.S. would have been as nice. We would not invite a stranger into their home for a drink. We would not like the Afghan people did.
We sometimes as a nation judge a country that has gone through this much. We only see the dark sides.
Do you really want to be good because you will go to heaven?
Dr. Richards continued on. He showed the class a series of images. They were about regular life in Afghanistan.
The officer was talking about his perceptions before going to Afghanistan. It was completely different when he got there.
They explained that. The man can declare he wants a divorce. Women can object. Women can at least be compensated for their grievances.
In Tuesdays lecture, Sam had a guest speaker, Bassim. He talked to our class about his experience with the United States army bombing his and his brother's houses in Mosul.
Rich explains how the time before an operation is a time full of anxiety. He said that this man was really keeping the spirits alive for his friends. To me, this is important.
I always end up learning things. I find myself reflecting about a topic or issue.
I personally would not feel comfortable speaking my opinion in this setting. I commend those that do.
The media platforms that the majority of Americans watch like CNN, & FOX, choose the news. They share the details they want to stream.
All we think and hear about is war and terrorist attacks. Coming from countries like Afghanistan.
I know. I personally assumed. Some places where massive wars are taking place, Afghanistan especially, were nothing but dust, destruction, and terror.
The children are raised on killing and hating and fighting.
I believe with every generation that comes along people are more open minded. They should be this way.
Would that person be authentic?
I've always questioned the sports versus race stereotype.
I agree with many things that you said.
I never knew that Afghanistan was a normal place to live in. It's just like America.
It is a journey of astonishment. The experience of traveling and learning about new places and cultures culminates in multiple epiphanies.
I could clearly see. They thought she was Indian. I saw the subtle difference.
It truly gives you another perspective on the world. You look at the parts of the world you have deemed other. You look at them just like our own society.
Americans can't seem to relate to anything the military goes through. We have a poor understanding of what they really do.
Overall, the class was a very thought awakening one. I feel. It helped me make more conversation within myself about things such as war, communication, and power.
I completely agree with what you are saying.
what you say about the statistics idea is very true.
In our minds they are thought to be nothing. They are humans just like us.
After many attempts, he responded. He informed us he is fine. Sadly, four men were killed while trying to prevent the mosque from the terrorists. The terrorists were disguised in an abaya.
People realize similar values and beliefs. They will see they are not too different.
The Afghan people are very accepting and hospitable. I found the way Lieutenant Colonel Garey expressed his appreciation to the citizens culture and generosity was wonderful. It was refreshing to hear.
One part of the conversation, I found interesting. It was the topic of reverse racism.
We all have been in our home spending time with our families. We have thought nothing of it.
Needless to say, there are definitely big changes on their daily life.
I recently watched a documentary a few months ago. It showed a CIA operative who went undercover in a terrorist organization.
Just as an example, I have an aunt who was divorced 5 times. She believes that those who are transgender should not be allowed to live.
Men should keep in mind that they have to pay child support. And some kind of a monthly stipend to the wife.
They are all bad according to the Bible.
You may be able to realize that all your parents wanted was you grow up healthy and happy. The parents want to raise you with good habits and values that you will be proud of. you may be able to understand that all the seemly pointless school works were to help you succeed. By meeting the kid that was being isolated, you may find yourself a new friend. s exactly not the one others always talks about.
I listened to definitions of forgiveness from all different types of people in the class. Not a single person truly defined the word.
The media reports bombings, soldiers captured, individuals being tortured/ much more.
it is tragic when lives are lost and people are wounded. What do you do when an enemy attacks you? What do you do when they hide amongst the civilians?
I think it would be very difficult to use the New Testament and books for actual answers. They can be taken many different ways. They aren't always straightforward.
This may also just be a cultural and millennial phenomenon.
That same mentality is what causes issues between different religious groups.
This statement is very weighty and used often in forms of hate. No one ever talks about the rest of the passage, though.
Make no mistake. Afghans are strong, resilient people who have endured thousands of years of war.
My earliest memory was of the attacks on September 11th in New York City. Every day for the next few months I recall the news stations placing the blame on Middle Easterners.
Hearing from Raffi really changed the way I view other cultures. I heard different things from the media.
Not all, but many judge others who are from other countries. They are developing and creating stereotypes and prejudices against them.
It is occurring halfway around the world. It is easy to overlook how the war is actually affecting real people like you and me.
There is an example everyone knows. The Bible says homosexuals will not go to heaven.
Some days you still may be angry and hurt. Choosing forgiveness gives you the strength to move out of darkness.
I couldn't help to feel almost guilty for having these false perceptions. I learned that the Afghan people are the complete opposite to what I originally believed.
Do you think it is the way you were raised?
Professor Richards made a good point. People not traveling don't usually notice these differences.
Research teams also value diversity to make their research more applicable.
Sam asked in this lecture what comes to mind when you think of Afghanistan. People thought desert, third-world country, poor, violent, and war.
I felt the exact same prior to leaving the room. Walking back, I reflected on it.
It can also add a connection between you and the people. Sometimes you may learn. You are not so different after all.
The fact that this clause was put into the First Amendment shows how important it is. Religion should not be associated with the government.
I actually remember sitting in the class and thinking to myself. I should have joined some military force for the United States.
They brainwash people into thinking the country as a whole is awful. They should target the groups that are monstrous. They should show how innocent people are being affected by this tragedy.
I am not big into politics or anything. Is all this worth it?
People believe that they are following their religion when they say they hate gay people. That is what God tells them to do.
I went to a school with about 700 people in just my class. I became pretty adapted. I befriended so many people of other races.
It's much better to forgive and forget. It's better than staying angry and living a worse life.
We choose not to pay attention to war torn countries. It scares us.
The United States is a world power. That's why it spends more money than any other country on the military.
I couldn't imagine living in a society that was governed by war. I couldn't imagine having to face it for years and years.
I completely agree with everything you have said.
I can't disagree with what you've stated. It's truly 100% opinionated.
Now, of course there have been killings across the US related to war or the uprising group ISIS. We don't see the struggles of our soldiers getting no sleep, barely eating, training for days at a time. They are  putting their life on the line every single day in foreign countries.
Ironically, ISIS who claims to obey god. Orders killing the people who pray to god in the mosques.
We hear about Afghanistan. It is through news, social media, or depictions in movies. It always seems to be in a negative way.
The fact that there are kind hearted people who give the American soldiers such hospitality. Opening their homes to them is so moving.
Civilians are vulnerable. They have to do whatever they are told. Their lives and their families lives are in danger.
America's past is too ugly and negative to just ignore. We should not forget about it.
I really enjoyed getting to listen to Rafi talk about whats important to him. I enjoyed many of things he believes.
Knowing this can help us be more conscious of the issues that are happening around that world. Knowing this can make us less ignorant to things around us.
People somehow are able to look past these other factors. Some factors are acts they have committed. Factors justify discrimination against different people.
The pictures of the mall and traffic jams. Showed that the people of Afghanistan are like us but living in a world of a warzone.
Most people of the world have similar values. They do not want to fight this war.
It was very enlightening. I see it differently now.
I enjoy it when Sam brings guests to class.
He even had tea at a man's house. When you think military or war, you do not think of having tea.
It came to better implement the establishment clause. This is the embodiment of separation of church/ state.
His unit had identified a man. He was a commander affiliated with the Taliban.
That being said though he was also emotionally unstable.
The obstacles should not hold you back.
He drove away. He did not even notice my existence.
The innocent people in Afghanistan already have groups that are against them. When people in other countries also grow this hatred towards them. It makes the situation much worse.
The pictures of the radical people with assault rifles walking around poor neighborhood sand huts are a much easier sell.
I always thought of history books. History books are important markers for future generations. I never asked myself. The history books go far enough to cover history in a correct fashion.
Being Americans, the affects of the Afghan war have changed peoples opinions on our government in different ways. It depends on one's view on war.
I will admit. I didn't really understand the war in Afghanistan.
It is hard to know. Do they have prejudice?
I think this will help the U.S. capture the criminals quicker. It will lead to less problems.
There was never a clear explanation of why a war is happening.
I chose the video What drives you to do what you do. It was under the Rethinking War heading.
They portray the people in those areas in such a negative light. The audience naturally generalizes about them. We blankets that behavior across all the people in that region.
All soldiers should be educated on the culture they are entering during deployment.
The same goes for every single person I know who is against gay marriage.
They are exactly like we are. War is intruding on their life.
These images and these people make me and many others rethink what we know as Afghanistan.
There are people in Afghanistan who want no part in war.
They would learn that not all Muslims are terrorists. They can't blame Islam for all of these acts of violence.
Half way across the world in a country ruined by war. There are still civilians. Normal people who have nothing to do with it.
We are able to look past that. We think of the positives. A human race could grow so much.
Lieutenant Colonel Richard Garey reiterates a couple times in the video clip. He was so shocked by the people he encountered while in Afghanistan. People in America assume the worst about all Afghans when we really should not jump to conclusion of what we believe they all are. They should be open minded. that there are actually good innocent civilians living in Afghanistan who are victims to the war as well
Lieutenant Colonel Richard Garey refreshed my perspective on Afghans. He told the class about his experience being stationed in Afghanistan. He told to the class about the shocking encounters he had there.
It was really sad to hear that Rafi's partner got killed in the process. You are right that no one deserves to go through that.
The establishment clause was considered a cornerstone of our country by our founding fathers. Many ignore it. Many don't know about it.
It is a heartbreaking story. It's just one of a lot.
You get used to it subsequently.
There are currently 917 hate groups in the United States. Most formed upon 1 sentence in the bible.
Sam explains the members of ISIS are men who had basically nothing going for them in life. They were easy to radicalize.
This made me think about my meeting an Iranian. I was an au pair in Denmark.
I guess I never really thought much of Afghan. I only thought about how war torn it is.
It was a simple question. It meant a lot more.
People from all over the world come together. They have children with one another. I find this to be a very interesting topic to discuss.
I find this class very fascinating. I am an authentic Asian. Even I found it quite difficult to do the task. The task was to classify people having Asian features into racial categories.
As citizens of the United States we do not really think of these injured people. We are not entirely to blame.
His friend and fellow prosecutor was killed. Despite this, Rafi continues to teach law and prosecute civil cases for the aim of peace.
According to Rafi and Dr. Richards, there are constant threats on Mr. Rafi every single day.
Reverse racism can not exist. White people were not colonized, enslaved, deprived of resources. They were not stripped of basic human rights throughout history.
We as Americans often push the thought of war going on in the world back in our minds. We repress its existence.
He kept repeating the word real. This emphasized it is a place with everyday people.
It seemed obvious to me that citizens of Afghanistan are just people. It was shocking  to realize. We let our lack of understanding convince us of nonexistent singularities much more than we should.
In regards to their own children in a mixed relationship, their opinion tends to vary.
They want to impose laws on abortions, sex education, teaching evolution in schools, and so many other issues. This is based on religious reasons in fundamental opposition to the constitution.
I could not even do it on a small scale with nothing on the line.
They would not show who the Afghan people truly are.
Islam come from the Arabic word salam. It translates into peace.
The Dialogue Project is a great way to start to do that.
We are updated and aware on the current issues of the world. Are we really? We do not perceive Afghanistan to be a country full of real life people, traffic jams, shops, and families.
Sam always emphasizes. He wants us to think. This class is to make us think. Not to judge any other country. or nation with stereotypes.
On the contrary, Islam is about equality. Men are no better than woman in Islam. It is just that their duties are different.
Sam pointed it out. This is very similar to how Sharia law works.
They fail to acknowledge the fact. There are people, just like us, living in the country.
The facts, updates, and statistics are only known to those that keep up with it.
That does not mean people in this country could not live happily.
I went to Catholic school. My family goes to church every Sunday. That's always how it's been.
Were just lucky enough not be born in a war-torn country.
No matter how hard it might be, I think everyone should always focus on the good things about themselves. Everyone should just go with it.
So many Americans get scared when they hear Sharia. What comes to mind are Muslims and their way of life.
We can't start developing these poor ideas about other people from different parts of the world. I think the media kind of twists how we see them.
I can't even imagine what it is like to live in a war zone like Rafi.
I can easily distinguish a North Indian from a South Indian. I can do it only by looking at them!
I agree with your statement. Anyone who is athletic and good at hockey can be good at basketball and vice versa.
It is only by talking to people face to face where emotional connections can be created. Understandings may be established.
This could be more difficult. It is harder to do research than it is to just form biases based off of social media. It is needed to reduce conflict.
The people of the Afghan village had all three of these qualities. Im sure there is even more we can learn from them.
They are more alike us than I ever thought.
I grew up in a bubble almost, where the rest of the world was irrelevant. The only thing that mattered was making plans with friends and going shopping.
This is shockingly less time compared to rules in some states here in America.
He decided to not let anger win. Despite the fact that he had every right to.
It emotionally touches us in films we see today.
This is hard to admit. I feel a lot of us live in a bubble. It is very true here at Penn State.
I think that religion is a very interesting topic. There are so many different perspectives and ways to interpret it.
We have forgotten. The battlegrounds of war house real people with real lives.
Sam is correct. He refers to them as essentially the same book.
Also, in the US, I think we have a different understanding in our minds about what members of the Taliban should look like.
To understand that these events are serious. They are happening to people just like us.
This infuriated my Baba and the rest of my family. No one to this day truly knows how to not be angry with her. They don't know how to forgive her.
Referring back to class last Tuesday. These people are like Bassim.
Its interesting. These are two main reasons a woman might separate from her husband in Islam.
Us Americans, all we see is what the media wants us to see. It is our window to the outside world.
It also says that if you apologize for what you have done, God will remember your sins no more.
I grew up as a Christian. My mom always used the Bible as a framework of how she lived her life.
It's truly scary to think about.
Another issue I found interesting. LTC Garey and Sam speak about the generosity of the Afghan people.
Their religion is based on love while breathing out forgiveness.
He was saying this. I was thinking to myself, Well yeah of course they are real people.
It is somewhat hard to believe even now for me.
People are still ignorant. They believe. The USA is fighting for their people.
Too many people are either unaware or look past the fact that different climates throughout the world require not only humans. Other organisms to develop certain traits.
He was not just mindlessly going in as a soldier.
US culture and Afghani culture may differ in this sense of hospitality. This lecture has helped in changing my perspective towards the Afghani people.
Why are we bombing those areas? They have no role in the war.
It was interesting to hear that. Sam talked about Christians.
The number of Afghan civilians killed continues to go up. The pointless killing is not helping anything. Otherwise the war would have ended earlier.
Prior to participating in this program, my notions about this country were admittedly naive.
I agree with you. It is truly unbelievable. Basim was able to forgive the United States government. This was after everything that they put him through.
Do not even eat with such people was a normal concept to accept. Those actions and ways of life were appalling to the average person.
We are endangering the lives of people. We think they don't matter.
Bassim was a normal civilian. Bassim was minding his own business. Bassim was not causing any problems. Bassim was living a normal life. lost his light, his daughter and wife, because of an accidental bomb.
With stopping the spread of terrorism many civilians have died with that effort.
I think that the truth about war and what actually occurs is hidden from us. When history is being taught to young individuals, the graphic and unpleasant portions tend to be left out.
I never really thought about divorce in that way. Only one party had the power to do it.
I never thought to represent the citizens too.
There is much more to a country than the conflicts that reside within its borders.
A huge majority of Americans see Afghanistan as a torn down country. It has always been at war.
The number of civilians killed continues to rise. Unless something is done about it, the number will keep rising.
Why do people have to put their lives on the line? Why are civilians losing their lives?
I think an important distinction to make is that news companies were created to make money. News companies were not created to give you the facts.
Times are changing quickly. People are becoming more progressive. They are opening their minds to new ideas.
I watched the What Quran are you reading?
I was surprised when Sam said the Quran and New Testament are not very different. I as well as many others thought the two religions were differed in a lot of ways.
Sure, places have different scenery and style. It is like those places if you travel across the United States. Around the world, it is very much like us.
We were shown a thriving town. People would sympathize with those in Afghanistan. That could have been us.
We cant pick out the ones that are easiest to target.
The biggest difference is their geographic location and the unfortunate fact. They are caught in the crossfire.
The church leadership has a long history of changing words in order to benefit themselves.
In my own interpretation. The people knew that not all things could be solved by the Bible. Human law was needed just as it is today.
These people are just like you and me. They have families and friends. In many cases they are killed for no reason. They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
It is supported by the few who are raised to be radical themselves. It is blind to the wants and needs of the many.
The lesson for the class was intriguing and insightful. He showed how individuals who practice islam can get a bad rap. Most of them are actually peaceful.
I agree. If we follow a specific religion, we should abide by all the rules. We should not pick and choose.
I continue to learn to see these differences.
It is anywhere the two sides go.
I think this shows that the Afghan people are fundamentally similar to us.
The first thing that came to my mind was war.
I couldn't agree more with Nicole.
There could be another factor. Putting faces to the Afghans could make the American people doubt why we are in this war.
Sam brought up a very important point. Judges cite the Ten Commandments in the court. They allow religion to play a role in their decision making.
Sam discusses how he breaks down people. He examines facial or body features. This meshing of genes and ethnicities helps people understand where they come from.
That's BS!
I feel that it is very hard to determine all types of situations by using one book.
While this may be true, I truly believe that the belief that we talk about race too much is one that is a primarily white belief.
I have been repeatedly proved wrong. This class was no exception.
We think that all that goes on in their world is fighting. That's not the case at all.
This is different from what most of the Western world would probably expect of Afghanistan.
I think the LGBTQ community is more accepting than interracial relationships.
This tends to piss us off. We're not bad people.
I am not saying by any means that I am a close minded person. The stories about the innocent people living in these countries are rarely reported on.
I grew up Catholic. marriage was always taught to be taken very seriously.
I think that part of our responsibility in empathy is to do our research. It is to understand that people from other countries are extremely similar to us and how we live. It is to sympathize with others to be able to first ourselves better in their shoes.
Most of the things you emphasized are really interesting. It starts with the fact. Men in Afghanistan sit down and drink tea to discuss their personal lives before a meeting.
I am Black. I grew up in a predominantly white town.
For example, at a point in Paul's life he wanted to kill Christians. Paul later realized what he was doing was wrong. Paul ended up becoming a Christian himself.
We all know that there were wars and battles between Afghanistan and United States because of gasoline ownership fight more than twenty years ago.
Christians read the bible. They interpret it in all different ways.
They live in a war zone. They face danger in the comfort of their own homes.
The vast majority of the time he engaged with Afghan civilians and security forces. He wanted to learn about ways of protecting the population.
He showed graphs. The graphs indicated how many people have died in the war.
I agree that we need to adopt the ideal of tolerance. There still is a certain line. If people cross it, no matter the religion, there should be consequences.
Experiencing life threatening, sad or shocking situations is something very delicate. Going thru these situations with somebody can make partners become even closer. It can tie them up emotionally.
War should not be motivated by what we can get out of it (AKA OIL).
The idea of radicalizing the Bible is scary. Human society and relationships are complex.
After comparing the Bible and the Quran in class,  I realized that our religiobs are similar. There is no reason for us to be fighting wars over religion.
There are a plethora of issues. In the end, it becomes difficult. We are setting legal rules for every edge case in our society. This is based on the teachings of a single book.
The fact that he was there and, like you said, was gracious to share his experience with us gave the topic more meaning.
Little kids like Rafis daughters will be able to do things. Things like going to the park without having to worry.
We don't ever see or hear about these horrific incidents. Like you said, the war hasn't been on United States territory since 9/11.
I thought it was interesting. He brought up that most hate groups in the United States are Christians. They think it is what they should do, fight for what God says.
I think this is a lot of the reason why many people in the United States have this opinion. The media here portrays the Afghan people in a bad light.
Rafis sweet little daughter will never feel like me.
Oftentimes, when we think about war. We dehumanize it. We do not really think about the actual lives that it effects. Especially on the other side of the fight.
Men cannot just divorce. They cannot just move on with their lives like nothing happened.
I would fear for my life. I never feel safe when I left my house.
Some people decide to leave their life. This is in hopes of not failing final judgment from god.
Very few of us pause to think about the people being affected by these tragedies.
Of course, you would want to get brownie points for the good things you do in the eyes of a higher power. The problem is, who decides what is to be good?
It interests me so much. My dad is a divorce attorney. He comes home most nights with crazy stories.
This often leads groups of people to agree on certain standards. For what is right and wrong within that society and culture.
It followed the 9/11 attacks 16 years ago. Bush saw this as a reason to gather our troops. He immediately send them over to Afghanistan.
I am very fortunate to have had the opportunity to meet and listen to Rafis story.
They do not need more hatred.
Is was impressive to see how in a small province a sort of election campaign is held.
In this video I was not able to her the man talk about his experience.
It is important to realize. People are not always the stereotypical version of the group they belong to.
It's heart breaking to think about.
There was an attempt to suppress this racial tension with the Civil Rights Movement.
I agree with what Sam said. He spoke about speculating without experiencing it first-hand.
In addition, I want to talk about ISIS. ISIS do and did bomb in Arab countries and also mine, Saudi Arabia.
War is much closer to them. They live out similar lives. They have similar ambitions. They have similar peace wishes.
I think that everyone should be better educated on the military. Sometimes they can get a bad reputation. It's because people are not educated enough.
I think about France. Images such as the Eiffel Tower and endless lavender fields immediately come to mind.
Most of them are just trying to survive the conflict.
Lieutenant Garey stood up. He answered this question. I believe he shocked many.
I asked my parents about this topic. they are less traditional.
Despite all of this, guess what? The media does not show any of this. It is not convenient for this country.
This is why our governments try to suppress the flow of those from Islam-majority countries into the United States.
The real people also refers to the soldiers that risk their lives. They leave their families to defend this country.
His stories were very heart touching. I truely enjoyed this part of lecture.
This quote really moved me. Previously, when I heard about the war or a bombing, it never really felt real to me. As soon as he put names to faces or showed pictures of things other than war, it made me realize how flawed my perspective of Afghanistan really is.
Why can't every country just find their own peace?
All these citizens want is for the fighting to stop in their backyard. They want to live in peace and have a pace for their family to grow up.
We see this from a Christianity perspective. It really shines a light on it. Most Islamic people must feel about that.
I feel. people who are not people of color worry about this. I would like to know what they think of this statement.
I was very intrigued during class two weeks ago. It was the class in which Sams friend Rafi spoke to us. Rafi answered our questions about his personal life in class.
There have been numerous amount of scientific studies. Studies show evolution is undisputed.
You would not want people to point out your physical traits. Like a sharp nose, perhaps a large forhead. It is embarrassing to call attention to things you are sensitive about.
Black is not synonymous with African American. I think this is important. Sam pointed this out to us. I think a lot of people don't realize this.
I picked this video. I believe that what Dr. Sam Richards is talking about is very true.
I think that classes like SOC 119/ other open-discussion forums are the best way to get past racism.
Even Sam commented that Jeffton was failing miserably during the process. Everyone was surprised by the results.
I believe dating outside of your own ethnicity is a good thing. It exposes you to other peoples cultures. It will make someone more culturally aware.
The first thing that Dr. Richards said surprised me.
When in a wide and diverse campus like Penn State, a lot of the walls of diversity are broken down. People are free to meet amazing students from so many varying backgrounds. Many students are raised in mono-culture, small town areas, where only dating white girls could be the same as only knowing white girls.
In that time, I was told that God created the world. God created everything that lives on it.
There is only one person that has ever guessed where I was from. I was really impressed.
These means that humans were not in control of the way that their bodies have changed over thousands of years.
The question itself was very tricky in my opinion. Any wrong selection would make the speaker sound unfriendly to some group of people.
I agree that this lecture was very interesting. It stood out to me in a lot of ways.
I found the video Do We Talk About Race Too Much?
Looking at this culturally, it could be from what you grow up playing/ admire. Sam talks about this in this video.
Nobody ever used to play in the south. They didn't have indoor arenas.
Rather, the culture in which that person was raised in that is the primary indicator of what they might be like.
Melanin helps protect the skin from UV radiation.
Although they give us the most business, we dread them coming in. This is because no matter what race we are or where we were born, the Syrian's make us feel as though we are below them.
He grew up in the America that threatened to lynch him on the way home. They stamped him and his mother negro.
You strip down race to just biological differences between groups of people. People are going to use these differences to be racist.
I feel like he doesn't believe what he said. Did to applaud the Indian student for standing up and speaking his opinion on the matter.
There was prejudice and racism in country's history. There certainly is prejudice  and racism in society today.
Nobody seems to want to talk about the Japanese internment camps during World War II.
We enslaved their people. We clearly crippled their ability to progress.
Plus, the terms of blackness and whiteness didn't just appear out of nowhere.
I have grown up in a very diverse area. I am very ignorant when it comes to racist stereotypes that people have of interracial couples and so on.
I believe that if each class level or tax bracket had an equal proportion of people from each race, that sports would not be dominated by one race. Sports would be more diverse.
I agreeat this generation is by far doing a better job. Trying to achieve justice and quality.
I learned last year from a Japanese friend of mine, that that was not the case.
When Sam mentioned how nobody wants to look in the mirror. Think man I am poor. I am responsible etc. He is absolutely correct.
One of the female actually wanted to date me. Even though I barely was there for a month. Because I wasn't Japanese.
This racial hierarchy puts people who identify with the label White at the top. People who identify with the label Black are at the bottom.
I think that by realizing the geographic feature that some people of certain colors/ ethnicities have, we can become more understanding.
I wrote about this same topic. I found your response interesting. It was very different from mine.
Joshua, I could not agree with you more. You made several points.
It's main use is very productive. It can truly be an asset. It helps both Sam and us in lectures.
This doesn't necessarily mean overseas travel.
It dehumanized people. It caused so many people to not live the free life they should have lived.
I believe that the way we view the world is limited by our personal experiences.
Sure there were protests on campus. We mostly showed respect to each other.
College classes are so different. You can schedule classes based on a topic you like. You are forced to take an English course. You are forced to take a math course. because the state says so.
There are countries that have deep rooted cultures. They have rich histories to be proud of.
Race has very little to no correlation with how athletic someone is.
But, looking back it was very obvious to see the disapproving looks. Especially from the older generations.
Listening to Sam today, I thought about flipping the script.
I agree with you. Sports are not inherently racist.
There is a second reason that race is such a big deal is. Americans have never come to terms with Slavery either.
I posted about an entirely different clip. It had similar comments.
I completely think that certain people being racist are based on how they were raised.
If that were not factored into the choices, then I think it would be a lot harder to find any differences on the outside.
I happen to be a white male that came from a predominantly white suburban area. I am attracted to black woman as well.
He compared African Americans. He showed the lecture hall why even white people across the world are nowhere near similar besides their skin.
I also agree with Olivia. College is different from anything we did in high school.
Travel to experience various cultures is essential to get a true understanding of the world.
The small differences in the way we look are super interesting. Learning what made us evolve the way we did in different parts of the world can teach us a lot about our history as a species.
America absolutely does have an issue with race. Being that our country was founded on racism in the first place. Not everyone is out to get one another. In the way that it is seen to do so.
Sam gave the example of India. The caste system exists there. It places people in clearly divided classes.
I'm going back to my original point. This type of thinking needs to start in the classroom.
In a class about race/ ethnic relations, you are assumed to know little to nothing about how we really perceive different races.
Growing up I always felt like I had the best of both worlds. Society seemed to constantly try to prove me wrong.
I feel like some people agree with these stereotypes. It seems true because the economical and political state that other countries are in.
People need to talk about race to make progress. It's hard to find the right place to do that.
I liked how Sam decided to use the example of Lebron James.
I can relate to wanting to be more active with the social media accounts similarly.
It is difficult to break mentalities. They have been in place a long time.
Talking about racial issues is always hard. It's something that needs to be done if we wish to overcome them.
Sam said in the video, we are 99.9% the same. I don't see why those in the Alt Right, and the rest of the racists do not understand anthropology . .1 percent is the only difference between each individual.
Most of the people who were lined up varied dramatically with their racial and facial features. The most striking thing is that their place of origin varied from what people would conventionally think of at first glance.
People think the U.S. talks about race related issues too much. Its always in the news and a hot topic. Its one that needs constant attention in order to curb racist and ignorant behavior.
With everything that is going on in the world (racism, nazism, discrimination and more) it is important that everyone understands the root of these issues. We have to understand what they really entail.
I liked Erins comment. We have to remember to use social media in a respectful way.
Though it can be a very positive thing it can also be used in wrong ways as shown in the video.
This is a huge problem in countries that are made up of immigrants.
I had never really thought about that.
Race has always been a sensitive issue in the United States. Race has always been an issue that you hear. News reporters lamenting over it on a daily basis.
Sam said that we are 99.9% the same fundamentally. It really had me thinking.
Overtime the noses will start to get larger. They evolved due to the environmental conditions.
People of these groups in the middle who can pass for white often will. They do this benefit from the luxuries and privileges that lighter skinned people are afforded systematically worldwide.
In all honesty, I don't think his opinion would change much. My Nonni really loved the video.
Race is a popular way to categorize people. It is mostly visual.
I remember speaking to one of my friends that I made here. I was complaining about the lack of diversity on our campus. She was confused.
Most Alt Rights deny hardcore scientifically proven facts. Still they claim their superiority over others. It is very alarming.
This is simply because baseball is so important to their culture.
However, this will not happen until we evolve more as a society. People of different races are of more diverse economic status.
Personally, I am not someone who is can point out racial/ethnic differences. Not even if my life depended on it.
I thought your last line was said perfectly.
I I liked how he called up people that looked different. Some had similar features.
You point out some really great things in your post. I enjoyed reading it.
I am from Panama. Every time I speak English, people ask me where am I from.
Most likely, people fail to look beyond the skin color or dialects of a person. They only notice how that person looks different than them.
We become more equal socioeconomically as a society. It must happen. We all become of one mixed race.
Golf has become a huge sport for the Asian culture. This shows that the game is growing and welcoming people from around the globe.
I found this discussion very interesting. I could not recognize the different skin tones either.
One of my grandmothers was Southern Italian. I told my mom about this class discussion. She said her mother would literally say she got black in the summer to describe how tanned she got.
If only more people understood this fact along with the causes and motivations that cultivate racist beliefs. The racism we see today would appear more like a solvable problem. Instead it's some omnipresent phenomenon we are powerless to fight against.
My family is from Ecuador. I have been called Italian/ Egyptian/ Japanese/ Israeli.
As an international student, it is actually easy to tell.
Grant, this was a pretty insightful response with facts. I had not yet heard of or thought about before.
We break out of our bubble. We have our own experiences in other countries. We can begin to realize that everything isn't like what were always told it is.
Because of countries like Japan, I believe that it is hard for the world to become of an evenly mixed race.
I think this should be discussed more. This should be looked at.
I have friends who fall into the category of the white males who are only attracted to white girls.
In that sense, I do not think it is talked about enough.
I go down to Mexico almost every year. I constantly hear the comparison of black Mexicans vs. white Mexicans.
Specific trades/family businesses are passed down from generation to generation. Sports like lacrosse are too. Lacrosse is a big part of Native American culture.
My mom told me that when she was a teenager, she was really upset. When Israel told her that he turned down a job teaching at a college in Texas. He wouldnt feel safe. Because of the attitude about mixed race marriages there.
Hand-in-hand with the realization that traveling the world is inaccessible or undesirable to many came the question. There were other ways to help people break out of their self-centered view of the world.
Jews are ranked the highest. They are the most ethnically similar to the Alt Right people.
In reality that's not the way it was.
It is a shame that race has roles in the events that have been taking place.
Racism can be displayed. It can seen on all accounts of color.
(family friends) did the ancestry.com test. All of the children got different results.
Race has nothing to do with how talented you are at a sport.
Being healthy/ happy is what they believed in.
I think everyone should learn about other features. As Sam did when he did the grouping.
Hell say things like outrageous and thats electric to describe things that I would normally just say. Something along the lines of thats hilarious or thats wild.
Different subcultures such as African Americans or Hispanics tend to be judged by the way they speak and pronounce different words. This can cause a negative outlook on their subcultures.
There are different geographic locations and climates. The .01% difference in everyone's genes have evolved over time to create what we have today.
It's all the same. Nothing has gotten better. It's just a lot more subtle in today's world.
If I remember correctly, this discussion began with the talks of white supremacists. It was regarding their recent actions in Charlotsville, Virginia.
I have only ever known the USA from the inside.
We do get very dark in the summer.
I've seen many people use race in a divisive manner to group together individuals in order to make blanket judgments about them.
I found it very interesting when Sam started comparing the physical differences. Between the Nigerian volunteer, and the other student.
With the point of the exercise, I agree that we need to fight our urge to judge someone automatically. Try to observe. Generally, become more aware of people and cultures outside of our own.
Hed said the easiest way to tell was by the eye shape. That is kinda difficult without really knowing the differences to be looking for.
I get what you're trying to say. In reality it's much more complicated than that.
It is interesting. Randomly, where we ended up on earth is what determined the kind of human we would be.
As you said, racism isn't exclusive to blacks in America. There are many ethnic groups that faced racism upon immigrating to a new country.
There is a common perception in the US. White individuals typically come from a middle class to upper class family.
I feel this contrast of culture is part of what causes each person to go towards they sport they do.
I am not promoting one ideology or belief over another.
It is no coincidence that people of color make up about 30 percent of the United States population. They account for 60 percent of those imprisoned.
He makes the content as interesting and opinion based as he can. Kids will actually care about the class. They will not pass it off as just another class.
I'd been talking to him about how I wished I knew a way to tell the difference just by sight. I wanted to be able to try speaking Japanese with people of Japanese descent, as I am a Japanese language major. Making mistakes in trying to speak to someone who is not of Japanese descent can be more than a little embarrassing. It seems very presumptuous on my part.
I also thought of all the many casinos in South Florida where I live. They are named after Indian tribes. The land the casino is built on used to be owned by Indians.
There were people posting negative tweets. About a student who stood up. The student respond to Sam's question.
I totally agree. A analyst of our country compared to others.
Reading your response allowed me to open my eyes to what a lot of people actually think about interracial couples.
I like how I am able to go on twitter and see how people are reacting/ Live tweeting just as if I was on twitter Seeing how people react to the Super Bowl or another big event like that.
It's a topic that has been talked about a lot.
I think it's really important not to generalize races. You never really know where someone is from.
I found this very interesting. It's because it is completely right.
A sport that was not talked about in class was golf. It is considered a snotty, white, rich, old men's sport.
One of those being, like he said accents.
A serious motion to change/ the dedication to fix the inequality Americans live with in society today would be a great step towards fixing a never ending problem.
There are actual theories and scientific studies conducted. That continue to feed into the idea of genetic difference between race.
I was born and raised in Philadelphia. Despite a few vacations abroad I have never lived outside of the United States.
The incident that happened in class was that people were not thinking thoroughly about the speaker's input on the question.
It is crazy to see how people from similar areas of the world can look so different.
Ever since Christopher Columbus and that whole thing, this country has always had more than 1 race of people. That is quite uncommon in a lot of other countries around the world.
We are all humans. No one will ever all agree on something. Instead of attacking someone and being hurtful, it would be better to either speak what that person says, or just be respectful and not say anything at all.
My family is super close. I did everything by myself since I started middle school.
I think there are several reasons that factor into the racial disparities we see.
Type A people do not affiliate themselves with liberal/ conservative ideologies.
It's a subtle way that racism has snuck into our vernacular. It's something that we should work to erase.
I do not believe that racism has ended.
I hope. One day, we can all agree on how amazing the diversity of our species is. We can avoid focusing on the diversity itself.
They may pick an ideology based on their parents beliefs. Friends strong views. The region they grew up in. They did not form their own opinions.
We all know how important it is to a child's psyche to grow up watching people they can identify with on the media.
I wish I was more educated on this history.
Everyone is basically the same. Growing up with this race and the differences in race have never been a big thing.
I don't think it is.
I would like to point to parentage that is more than just black, such as Jamaican or Haitian. I have no written record of my parentage due to slavery.
My freshman roommates friend from high school lived with an Asian roommate. He had Black/ Indian suite mates.
It is very interesting to actually see the differences in peoples faces depending on where they are from.
My Nonni (my grandma) and her three older brothers traveled from Sicily. They started a new life in Manyaunk, a neighborhood in the northwestern section of Philadelphia.
It is important to travel and experience different people and environments different than the ones you are used to.
In the video Sam talked about if he had passed by those two girls quickly. He would have thought they were the same race too. If he had stopped to really look at them he would be able to tell the difference. I found it very interesting. and realized I would do the same thing if I walked by someone quickly.
To be honest that made me feel unconfutable.
The discussion in this video helped me think of the subject of race in a different point of view.
I do think. There is some truth to both claims.
Another thought I have is about writing papers.
Biology and sociology go hand in hand.
People were sent to camps just because they were of Japanese descent.
My father was born in Japan. My mom was born in Norway. It always blows my mind that two people on the absolute opposite sides of one land mass eventually married. The chances were of my existence happening at all were very small.
In America, our culture tries to create perfection. At times, it seems as if people are rewarded for changing themselves artificially to achieve beauty.
Generalizing the sport as racist is simply not correct.
It might be true that black people have a more natural physical capability. To perform certain sports. Than white people do purely because of their genes.
Being American, I understand your mentality. I am someone who feels that America is the greatest country in the world.
We all come from different parts of the world. We are one human all together.
A good friend of mine in high school was black. He had a white girlfriend.
We should try to see it from different perspectives and grasp that it is real.
I believed that people with straight teeth were fundamentally higher than others whose teeth were not straight. I realized you couldnt base people off of appearances.
I think of the damage that was done by Columbus and his men. My heart breaks for the Native Americans.
I feel like there are several reasons that factor into the racial disparities seen today.
These things came from historically planted precedents . They help us to better understand why things are the way they are.
This activity really put it in perspective. It can be hard to know a stranger's race.
Racism is not the same as it was four hundred years ago.
I have often watched sports throughout my life. I wondered the same thing.
The point of this exercise is that it's really difficult to pinpoint someones background based on appearances. We should all try to stop judging people that way.
Race has been a problem that I believed was slowly getting better.
The conclusion that you drew from this part of lecture is very interesting. I can not agree more with some of the points that you made.
I remember one time I told a girl that I was from Tunisia. She responded with No, really, where are you from?
I thought you brought up a very good point. The United States is very diverse.
I believe he gave this example to address the fact. The US is not the only place in the world where there is racism.
People keep watching. The news networks keep pumping these stories out. The result is a huge amount of discussion on these outlier situations.
Dr. Richards explains. These physical characteristics allowed our ancestors to thrive in the specific climate they lived in.
Sam opened my eyes to see the reasons behind the difference in people of different ethnicities.
The theory of evolution is something. I have tackled to understand the theory of evolution my entire life.
I am sure it makes some people uncomfortable. It is necessary to see any type of progress.
Almost half our country did belong to Mexico.
The DNA codes our physical traits. The DNA is only a fraction. We are made of it.
The student went up to group the other classmates together by their ancestral background. Everyone expected him to fail.
It's interesting to think about. Nevertheless, it is definitely a reality in today's sports.
The person from Afghanistan is like a normal person. He works hard to make sure his family is good.
We have made some strides. Some days it seems like history is doing nothing more than repeating itself.
I agree with Sam. Most people in America do not even believe in the Native American tribes even exist anymore.
Slavery has been taught to me in my public school system. I think a large part of my education on slavery had to do with the Civil Rights movement.
Hearing about this is in class I have noticed a lot of features I never noticed. It's on people who I've known years.
I too thought your Korean national fencing team example made an interesting point. Helped to further the discussion Sam started. During this lecture a few weeks ago.
Personally, people can never tell where I'm from. Whenever someone asks me I always ask them to guess. I'm interested in what they'll say.
I would say that it is almost its own culture in my family to enjoy/ play football.
He said my characteristics gave him no indication of my ancestry.
This is something I have experienced first hand here at PSU.
People need to recognize the issue before anything can be done. This country is still extremely racist. Though, some of us may not see it.
People can sometimes be afraid to bring up a valid racial point. They feel like they offend someone.
How can understanding this racist belief help me stop it?
We compared the two boys with their noses. Sam talked about the why they were different. Differences due to the weather conditions their ancestors lived in.
Having a class like this brings to the spotlight the touchy racial and political issues that Sam enjoys explaining and going into depth about.
Both factors about why race is an issue in this country pertained to the means by which this country was founded on.
I think that they are more culture involved.
I wasnt sure how to react to that answer.
We are all human. The differences in our skin and our features is simply where in the world our heritage comes from.
I think the NFL is honestly a great place to do that.
I think you're on to something. I'm kind of in the same boat as you are.
I think the main issue regarding race is that most people are uneducated about the topic.
Even when I am speaking Spanish, most of the people know that I am from Panama. I tend to speak very fast. I use many Spanglish words.
I agree with the student who made the point that hockey is a more expensive sport to play growing up than basketball.
There was a large divergence in the ranks. That these people gave these 4 groups.
Compared to today, frequently we see race being an issue discussed on the news.
I found the concept trite and repetitive. I suppose his target audience was the alt-right. It was not a woman of color.
I believe that we need tofocus on having these conservations. With people who may not be so open minded.
It was normal to see people of two different race/ cultures come together.
This stereotyping and judgmental nature is a very predominant issue. Our society must learn to address.
The difference in the nose size is all due to genetics and the evolution of the people and backgrounds we came from.
Is it really worth killing hundreds of thousands of civilians to install democracy?
I believe that statement is completely false.
He goes on to explain how the white person is always in front of other races.
It has evolved. It has taken on a new form.
I can't believe it was so easy for me to assume someone was from the same region. It was only based on the color of their skin.
The beginnings of American infrastructure was built on the backs of slaves. The home that we took them from was prevented from advancing.
I am certain. There is some sort of influence on every athlete's life. That makes them decide what sport they would like to play.
One student brings up that India doesnt have the same issues.
Whats interesting is, I didnt even take issue with the content of his statement.
I believe that there is a subconscious level that determines racial preference. This racial preference comes to attraction to other groups of people. This preference is different for every person
His statement got me thinking. Racism does exist in my family.
I really found that out of all the responses, this was one that really spoke to me. I never really seem to think about hockey let alone that it has something to do with race.
This country was built by immigrants. It seems that as a country, we have forgotten that.
In my opinion, part of it is black people are just built better.
Seeing how black people can essentially out jump or run any white person. Gives them an overall edge in sports. Like football and basketball.
He went on to explain why someone might be that way. This again was something I never really thought of.
Teaching children these principles early in their development has the potential to be ultra effective. It can certainly ease tensions between races.
I had never really heard of that mix before. I thought it was pretty cool.
People were more tolerant and accepting.
I feel that the visual representations really allow all 700 of us to be fully engaged and interested in every discussion.
I believe that there is plenty of truth to this in a variety of different ways.
What I found very interesting was how the grouping of the people went.
Take Muggsy Bogues for example. He is only five feet three inches. He was an incredible basketball player.
It is much easier to tell that someone is black than it is to determine someone is Catholic.
Like Matt and the other volunteers said it is more common to see someone of an African ancestry in the NBA vs a white person. This might be because of where and how they were raised. It could be because of their culture. It could be ge way that each individuals body is built.
This idea still seems weird to me. I know I am guilty of doing the same.
It just means that they live in a place with better resources.
All humans will one day all look the same. All the races will have mixed so much. People will still find ways to discriminate against others.
My mother was born in America. Her father immigrated from Ireland in his youth.
Do we talk about race too much?
Sam made a good point in the clip. I had not thought much about it prior to going to that lecture.
The way people in Pittsburgh speak sounds different than the way we speak here in State College.
Thinking about this exercise into perspective, Jeffton was failed from the beginning.
I adamantly believe we don't.
I believe modern white supremacy is the answer.
I am always ready to learn about a different perspective other than my own. I liked that you had a similar idea about evolution.
It's all about what kids of different regions of the country/ different ethnicities watch on TV growing up.
People ask me what I am. They can't figure out where my ancestors are from by looking at me.
With that being said, I still thoroughly enjoyed talking about this topic. What Sam said was 100% factual.
At first I was thinking, that it is not true.
We did kill Native Americans to gain land.
Speaking generally, you can say that countries in India are less diverse. Based off of what the student was saying, it seems like they have their own melting pots of people too.
It has to be the mindset of people.
She texted her mom 24/7. If she didn't text her mom good night and good morning her mom would call her and get mad She would know she skipped class or didn't go home at a normal time.
I think the guy in the video did very well at matching ancestor groups. He was at least better than I could have done.
Another thing that stood out to me. We did not discuss in class. Most white sport players look up to black players as you listed above.
I myself did not realize it was real at all.
The one who works harder/ is more dedicated to what they do is going to succeed every single time.
You spend a lot of time training. Your body allows you to get good at a sport. It does not matter what race you are.
Basketball is infinitely more popular in that culture. Hockey just won't attract black youth to play it. It is not as cool.
That was never something that caught my attention before.
We dont have diversity there.
I could not agree more with this entire post.
I think this video was very informative. This video was engaging to learn that mixed races are the fastest growing ancestry group in the United States.
People also tend to get darker. If they are under the sun for a long time.
Now, I know Sam himself does not feel this way. He said it (like most things he says) with the intention of hopefully getting people riled up.
Although slavery is illegal in the United States there is still systematic racism that is in place. It prevents the advancement of people of color.
When he pulled up the pictures. Showed the one of the girls and said that they are connected the same way as him. I realized that Sam is right.
I have never dated in my race. That may be due to being raised in a mostly white neighborhood.
He said some sports are not even available to play in some parts of the country.
More people understood their heritage Pride. Feel less pressure. The way they look artificially
Racism/ violence have been at the forefront recently. I think one thing is going to push us through this: unity.
Our country was founded on racism/ genocide.
I believe that blacks simply aren't interested in playing hockey as well.
I was so focused on getting good grades. Nothing else mattered.
This red candy tastes sour. That makes you think that other red candies will also taste sour.
Ive met some hardcore religious people. They dont even pray.
The saying an old dog cant learn new tricks shouldnt apply here nor be an excuse on racism.
We need to find a middle ground. This is easier said than done.
I thought this was a very interesting point. I found it to be similar to the discussion in a different class about Christian Sharia.
I found this to be one of the most interesting portions of the lectures.
Especially when he made one of guys pair them up in different groups. Based on how they looked.
This is a pretty heavy question. A hard one to approach within myself.
In warmer climate type sports, blacks are more prominent in the warmer weathered sport.
We did place people in internment camps. They were Japanese.
I also find myself asking why people completely disrespect the thoughts of others. When we are all basically the same.
We all have some variation of DNA in us that we share despite race differences.
I picked this one. I really enjoy conversations regarding religion/ peoples beliefs.
I've never thought about it before.
In public education we learn a lot about the Civil Rights movement.
My Uncle Denny passed away three years ago. He was your typical straight off the boat Italian. He didn't think too highly of black people.
Lets take Milo Yiannopoulos for an example. Someone who often put him in the same group as Spencer.
I think. You have a good grasp on what he was trying to accomplish in this talk.
With that in mind, I hope that Sam continues these type of lectures in future classes.
Racism against African-Americans is still very present. Some progress has been made.
I believe this is largely due to the media in the US. Their sole purpose is to divide us as Americans. We want to turn us against each other.
He says that the idea of slavery was really what created the idea of racism in this country. It was dehumanizing all these people.
With that being said, there are negatives to this. Sam outlines this in his video.
I went down the line. I tried to match people up myself. It wasnt as simple as one may think.
I grew up in the suburbs of NYC. I have been visiting my family in Japan almost every year.
Why can't people acknowledge that black people were treated less than dirt?
Living in the midwest, you probably have never played lacrosse before.
People who aren't extremists know the difference between right and wrong. Don't all racists believe the same shit anyway?
I think. These common trends come from within our culture.
Hockey was first developed in Canada in 1875 and continues to be popular in the country of Canada because of the country's climate.
I like your point about how important it is to widen our horizon. It's important to try to interact with the new different cultures.
I appreciate these statements that Sam makes. They can unify our incredibly diverse student body.
You know that the person sitting right beside you could be from another continent. That is incredible to me.
These are two facts that are due to culture. There's nothing racist about this perspective. Hockey is played almost exclusively white.
It is a step in the right direction. We should make everyone feel more equal in their environments.
I believe it adds a certain element. It is something I have never had in a class before.
Many citizens would answer that question thus. They would say that they are in fact racist.
The alt right group claim that the white society is the most evolved. It doesn't feel right to me.
It leads me to the conclusion that Alt Rights must have some kind of mental disability to deny scientifically proven facts. They support absurd opinions about society. How else can humans be so incompetent?
He also talked about how their eyes had a different form as well.
It's actually unfortunate. We don't like to being discriminated against. Nonetheless, we do it in our own community.
This is the way I see it. Anyone who uses race to put another man down is lacking the self confidence they need to be proud of them self.
We commonly see this in incidents with law enforcement encounters.
To be thrust into the world of the unknown was a little frightening.
I dont think racism was a factor.
I believe what he was trying to say, in his little rant about the accents and facial features, was to be aware of the different physical and vocal features that people of even the same color have.
It's annoying to break people from that type of thought. I usually come off as rude for trying to correct my family members. they need to know that being dark doesn't make you less than a white Mexican. Being a white Mexican doesn't make you better than a dark Mexican.
I was raised in a Catholic household. I do consider myself a Catholic.
When we travel around the world we see people having different noses due to their certain climatic and survival conditions.
I do believe that there is some creator out there. It started us off in the process of where we are today.
Why would a black person believe that whites are the most evolved?
Morgan Freeman brought up an interesting point. He was asked about his opinion on black history month.
Start a certain sport at a younger age. You are likely to continue playing that sport.
Dr. Sam Richards mentions that it may be difficult to understand. How do people coming from different parts of the world come together and have children? In reality, the whole world is mixed up.
Some sports like baseball, lacrosse and hockey are majority white. Sports like basketball and football are mostly black.
I think it is nice that people take interest in learning where other people are from.
These people might actually enjoy a different perspective. These people might take a liking to new things other cultures can share with us such as food, music, dance, and other interesting cultural traditions.
The people that are not affected by racism are the ones that want to just ignore the problem.
I feel. People who are in the same economical standing tend to think and act the same. Two people have the same skin tone or facial features. To me it would make more sense. who that person is based on their so called class.
Do We Talk About Race Too Much?
I believe it is a personal preference. It is a culture thing.
I am minoring in Kinesiology. The topic of race in sports is one I have often discussed in class. Discussing it in Soc 119 is very different. Everyone is more open.
Lekan spoke about the 5% increase in tan. I understood. Only people of different race are able to rank their skin color on a relative basis.
I now know that what makes up a persons racial identity. It's much more than that.
The mixing and fusion of different people from different backgrounds with different experiences. Is what makes our country, and every other nation on Earth, great.
I am guilty of seeing the donate 1 cent per day. I feel bad toward everyone in the whole country.
Peoples facial features/ structure is completely different This is due to where a person comes from.
I hope to have classes in the future that might incorporate more social media.
Between ice skates, protective gear, and paying for private ice time to practice on ones own, playing hockey costs a lot more than a pair of sneakers and a basketball.
There are many details about people which cannot be made unless one truly knows the background of that person.
The point you made about religion. How religious people do not look at the scientific viewpoint. Really stuck out to me.
Some high schools are very into their respective sports teams. If you live in a neighborhood like that you are more likely to play that sport.
That definitely effects the way people act regarding the grudges that they hold today on one another.
One example of this happened not too long ago. A racist woman verbally attacked a Sikh Canadian politician. This was during one of his public forums.
I really was not thinking of how we are physically built. It didn't think about the makeup of how we are connected.
This all relates back to being politically correct. This was something else we discussed in class.
Not even counting the equipment, one must also pay for private ice time at a rink. There are exponentially less ice rinks in America then basketball courts.
Not to mention that evolution is present in most of our features. Sam pointed this out.
I feel as though the huge issue of race in the United States is something that I've never questioned or thought about. I've never known it any other way.
Events have taken place in cities in America and all across the globe. These are things that have been happening for centuries now.
I'm glad You found it interesting.
These are just differences. The differences should be accepted.
I found your background to be interesting. It gives you a good perspective of how racial issues in the United States compare to other places around the world.
This is why there is so much white supremacy in this country.
It really opened my eyes to how different everyone's lifestyle is.
None of my best friends played hockey or anything like that. My cousins that live in Hershey. Pennsylvania basically worship the sport.
The analogy comparing it to liking a certain gender is very accurate.
At this point, it might be trying to teach old dogs new tricks.
These events and actions do not represent the vast majority of the American population from any perspective. These events do get the most attention. Everyone voices their opinion on the events. It always boils down to people picking a side and refusing to consider the situation from another perspective.
It's definitely something to think about!
Sam started to explain how he could tell that she was Japanese/Italian. I started to be able to see it too.
I work at a seafood restaurant by the beach in Jersey. We have a lot of Syrian families that come in. They are our biggest customers.
I think in our society we have sort of established that whites rule.
It is funny howpeople call latinos Mexicans. People have a stereotype that every Spanish speaking person is a Mexican.
I just wanted to offer a different perspective. Some people might not be cool with it.
Looking at my own nose, it is very small. This makes me think that my ancestors did not live in a cold area.
We understand that prejudice and racism have existed and do exist. I will now give my opinion of why this is.
I can agree that people of certain cultures and geographical locations can play a role in determining what type of sport is more or less dominated by a specific race.
Another time this occurred was with Keven-Prince Boateng. Keven-Prince Boateng had racial slurs yelled at him during his match against Pro Patria.
One of the videos on the Soc 119 website is about people of Chinese ancestry. They grew up in the South of the United States.
We have to study and learn from our history. We have to make sure that it doesn't repeat itself.
Basketball/ Hockey have two different types of races that dominate the sport.
I also found it interesting how skin pigmentation is determined by our level of need for protection from the sun.
I enjoyed watching this activity. It allowed for people to realize. Some of the most minor differences can make each person so unique.
People truly believed Africans and African Americans were less than human.
These people could not control these factors. It should never be acceptable to discriminate against another simply due to the color of their skin.
People believe this is the greatest country in the world.
I noticed that she literally had everything overstocked to the max.
I do not think sports are inherently racist. It is cultural precedents that can determine what we are into.
I never have really thought about this before. We feel the same way.
Do they genuinely believe that their culture is boring? Is it kind of a racial sensitivity thing?
55 being muslims. 73 being jews.
This activity proved that there are more than just white, blackish brown people. Families from all over the world can have very simple or complex backgrounds.
I believe that people should listen to Sam's story. People should learn from it.
I feel like this class is a good way to educate those. That maybe aren't so aware about the issues of race.
America is one of the most diverse countries in the world. It consists of many activist groups.
Sam decided to call seventeen volunteers to the front. I knew that it was going to be really interesting to see how well Jeffton matched people. It was going to be really interesting to find out where each individual was from.
I like the point that Sam brings up. It is more of a class thing.
Love and race is a tricky topic. I agree of course. To be close minded is ignorant. To  simply not date black girls is ignorant.
Neither of these things seems likely to happen on a large scale anytime in the near future. I guess the majority of us have to be happy just accepting Sam's conclusion that we don't know anything.
The colder climate areas of the world, or even of a sport, usually tend to have more white people than black.
The way people in the United States perceive others is a very poor practice.
What he said was that it was going to take a white player kneeling during the national anthem to create any sort of change.
When you turn on the news, a majority of the biggest stories are race related. These play on the fears of the viewers.
The darker skin tone literally protects the people from hot climate areas from being burned.
We talked about how most athletes in the NHL are white.
This was mostly through people being very determined to date only within their race. It was due to a multitude of reasons.
What difference do details make?
If I wasn't in class I would see this stuff and genuinely want to come to class.
It's important to be respectful and thoughtful of different cultures and ethnicities.
He stared back at Sam looking clueless. He made an estimation of two thousand.
People of color are still paid significantly less. They are less likely to receive promotions than their Caucasian counterparts even when they have equal or more experience.
Why does this image evoke such a strong stance on something I never even noticed before?
I think. this example here did a strong job. It showed how small and silly our differences are to create argument and violence over. The amount of mixed people is growing every year. and eventually will be the majority for years to come.
The most recognized issue that happened in America was slavery.
There are some who still hold strong faith in it.
The United States has a long way to go to solve its racial problems. Discussions like these bring us closer together.
Speaking about race will allow us to move forward as a society.
Football is a sport that is only played in United States. This is besides a few exceptions.
I picked this video. It was a topic that I found very interesting in class.
Many people hold their race near and dear to them. It is something that makes them different from everybody else. Often times, they are proud of that.
When a student proposed the question. Why is race a big deal in the United States. Many reasons came to my head.
The prime examples were the Latinos who looked as if they were from Europe or America.
Not talking about it/ acting like everything is okay wont get us anywhere.
Sports are not about race. They are about being the best.
And before I start I want to say that yes racism is a huge problem in America. When the conversation was started it was only pointed at the US. Saying, we are the only country with issues with race. Which I believe is false.
Yet I had not even thought about the millions of Native Americans that were killed. Many more displaced from their homes.
I am very similar to Casey. I have never thought about whether sports are inherently racist.
I agree that financial status has a lot to due with who is good at sports. It's not just race.
That's the reason I do believe God helped shaped how we evolved.
A lot of people complain. Immigrants feel out of place here. This is an example of a culture. It makes us feel out of place in our own country.
I like to think they are a start to a more accepting/ culturally aware world.
That is why this class is a helpful course for any member of the Penn State community.
There is racism, hate, and bigotry. Race will always play a huge role in American society.
Id probably fit in Theistic/ Naturalistic Evolution.
I really think that where you grow up, and the culture in which you are surrounded, is much more important than race in sports.
I also believe it will continue to be a problem if we don't address it properly.
I'm attracted to women of all races.
Japan lets in very few immigrants. Japan is very much not diverse.
I have always looked at the evolution scale without thinking much about it in terms of race.
Black kids might watch TV. Black kids might see the majority of players are black. Black kids might psychologically lean towards playing basketball. The same goes for white people and hockey.
Sam's point about great athletes being great at other sports with proper practice was very strong.
It's because this is such a large class. Social media gives us the perfect opportunity to share our ideas on a more intimate level.
It is something that naturally catches my attention.
I personally, also strongly agree with Darnishas point. Interracial couples are for the most part perceived as an exotic experience nowadays.
It almost feels like the class needed that early in the semester to setup the kind of topics/ issues that are going to be addressed in this class.
I have a good friend from just outside of Boston. He still surprises me sometimes with the way he talks and the different words he uses in different ways.
You both have to be willing. You both have to be open to each other's cultures!
I like Brookes comment. Social media makes this information more appealing to our generation.
Sam did a good job explaining. It shouldn't be weird to take a closer look at someone. It's how we learn.
The culture that people are in dictates what sports they are going to play.
It is amazing to see that human beings have evolved based on where they have settled. They settle near the equator where the earth is hotter when compared to other regions.
We counted 7 bottles of contact solution. This was absolutely absurd.
The girl in this video seems to be very open to dating people of all races. She probably has a preference as to what type of guy she's attracted to.
High school football in Texas plays a more prominent role in the choices people make than simply access.
If it did, then the NFL and NBA wouldn't be nearly as fun to watch.
Then, there was also a picture of a poor family in a war torn nation.
No one wants to come in second.
That is institutionalized racism.
It's simpler to think of members of a race as one homogeneous group that shares certain characteristics. Than to consider each of us autonomous beings. With our own thoughts, skills, and desires.
For me, what was most interesting and eye opening about this lecture is that all thesedifferent body features are due to evolution and the way humans adapted to different climates.
To both groups, I say: you're right.
He also made the point. There are huge issues such as the war on drugs. Specific races are targeted. The government just doesn't talk about that enough.
Sam explained this. I began to realize a sense of pride in my ancestry. I had never felt it before.
This proves to be true in culture/ religion.
This is why it leads to pigmentation and reduction in melanin in other areas. If you go up north or south away from the equator.
I agree with both comments. Social media is a positive aspect of Soc 119.
In my opinion there is no better topic of discussion with the world we live in today than race relations. I feel growth happening every Tuesday and Thursday in Thomas 100.
In class it was discussed about the misconception of status based on peoples background.
There's another thing I noticed. The majority of people who asked me these types of race questions were white.
This is why traveling is so important. We can see that there are millions of other people out there.
Personally, I am dating out of my race. I never thought about it.
The civil rights movement allowed us to have the ability to talk about these issues openly. That is one of the main  reasons why our race problem seems so much more unjustified and horrible. Than other places.
For example, my father has been a football fan since the day. He was born.
Sam pointed out they have very different features. I could see how they weren't.
I don't think sports can be racist, at least not at the professional level.
It will likely not be an easy task for people to begin to look at the world in a different view. This is mainly because I believe people don't want to.
We are all the same. It's just a matter of what your background is, where you come from. It's important that people start to recognize that.
I do agree with you that it is probably a cultural difference that causes these racial imbalances in sports.
You say that we talk about racism to much which encourages even larger public displays of racism. This is true in a sense.
Many places simply avoid the discussion all together in safe spaces. This prevention causes issues to rise.
I did not learn enough about this in my Jewish private school. I attended it from first grade through eighth grade.
So many people around the world making these claims made it easy for people to buy into it. This allowed them to not feel like monsters for what they were doing.
In colder climates this is why we tend to see people with bigger longer noses. They need this feature of their noses to survive.
I am really looking forward for the future class.
The area the volunteers descended from grew larger. It grew further apart. The differences became more noticeable.
In reality, every race has the same chance at being in the NHL. Hockey is played by more white people. It's because it's part of their culture.
I also found this discussion about genetics to be very interesting.
I think its amazing that something simple like nose/ eye shape can help you determine what region someone is originally from.
So many other human features are based on evolution and adaptation. This is also one that should not be discriminated against.
I think this was fascinating. We learned that due to different shapes/ sizes of their physical features we can sometimes tell that they are from different places.
Sam was talking about religion. He used a very interesting way to interpret it.
With that said, I do not think sports are racist. They are just cultural.
All people are created equal, but sadly, not all can see that.
Her example of hockey equipment being expensive is a good one.
I've always had this standard assumption. Everyone has evolved at the same rate. It's based on the various ancestral needs of each races.
I have a broad range of friends from different cultures. I can say that it is a beautiful thing to be able to learn and open your hearts to various customs around the world.
I walk arounf campus often. I am starting to notice how everyone has such different features. I am able to understand why they have their specific features.
I feel like this portion of the class is so crucial and poignant. It seems like we see it in the news almost daily.
Talking about something/ finding a solution to something are two very different things.
Interracial mixing happens. Genes start to randomly mix and dominate. It becomes nearly impossible to tell a persons exact heritage.
Hard-work, dedication, and confidence. Are the key factors that decide your future in athletics.
Professor went around with the microphone. Many people answered such a range of numbers.
In today's society, with everything that is going on, it is hard for us to come together. We are one country who live under the same set of laws. We are all guaranteed the same rights.
Sam had mentioned it in the video. The disparities are greatly influenced by culture.
I got hung up on whether that the advice was actually useful. Maybe there were other ways to get the same result.
I did not know that lighter colored skin was regarded positively in Mexico.
What makes talking about race seem redundant or overplayed is when people don't know anything about what they're talking about.
However, it is a touchy subject to have a real discussion about under most circumstances.
Those who say they are conservative or liberal, but do not exactly know what that entails, are Type C people.
You hit the hammer on the nail.
When I was young, I mainly played soccer.
It can also be used as an excuse to ignore our own problems.
It is partly due to straight up genetics. Culture plays a huge role into the situation.
In this country, especially now, this debate has become very heated. People have very strong opinions over race and if there is a problem with race.
Prejudice and discrimination may be legislated out of our society (for the most part). That doesn't necessarily reflect the personal attitudes of people.
I considered the fact there might not be a God at all.
I am glad that Sam Richards did this activity. Hundreds of people can see and learn all different genetic traits. People have based genetic traits on their ancestors' geographic climate.
Maybe we'll even start identifying like Americans in place of whatever country we came from.
It might be true that white people have a better capability to perform other sports.
What features do I have that make people think I am Egyptian over Ecuadorian?
There is no excuse to look at another individual's skin color, facial features, way of life, etc. There is no excuse to assume that they are less of a human than anyone else.
Christopher Columbus stumbled upon this land. It was one of the worst genocides in human history was orchestrated.
I went to a really small high school. The majority of the students had an Irish or English background. It was really interesting to see all the different ancestries of these students.
I think that sports are not racist. They are inherently an aspect of culture.
Me and her were complete opposites. I honestly think that I was able to help her by not babying her or putting up with it.
I was constantly judging and looking at people differently. It was based off of what clothes they were wearing. It was also if their teeth were straight.
Furthermore, Dr. Richards does a great job of explaining how these traits are necessary for their evolution.
My extended family really did not affect my parents at all. They always tell me how rude it is of my other family to make those certain comments whenever the family is together.
However, I do not believe we talk about race enough in a way that can move us forward: becoming educated, learning about different races, and how races are affected by certain things.
This makes me feel like Im part of a diverse, intelligent, fun group of people not just a lecture.
Some of what you found iffy was just a little bit iffy to me.
I have talked about it in other classes. The idea was common not even that long ago. Africans and African Americans had an unfair advantage in sport.
They were just completely surrounded by it. They saw their local people make it to the pros.
It is a really nice mantra we like to spit out and justify all our actions with. Democracy is so great and nothing else compares.
I really enjoyed reading this response. It was nice to see the difference in opinions that we share on this topic.
I think that athletes in each sport are good at what they do. They are naturally built to succeed.
I also never really noticed the differences in others appearances. I didn't until watching a few of Sam's lectures.
I can remember how big of a deal it was among people who had lived in the town all their lives. Multiple African American families moved in.
Just like you, I'm proud of my heritage. I didn't feel the need to discuss it.
This is not meant to rebut your opinion. I hope this gives you something to think about.
So all in all I feel that some the biggest reasons sports arent inherently racist is because of cultural differences between most people with another reason being because of social class.
Other nations still have race issues or social inequality in some way too. They do not shine a spotlight on it like they do in the United States.
The only thing that came into my mind was the Florida State Seminoles. The campus of Florida State University is where an Indian tribe used to live.
Technology such as iClickers, Twitter and other social medias can engage students with the instructor and the subject being taught.
Step back/ look at slavery. Give yourself a chance to see why race was created in the first place.
For me personally, I know racism is a very prevalent thing in America. It's prevalent among many different races.
We could overlook our small differences. We should focus on the point that we come from the same place.
My friend, he has crooked teeth. That is due to the fact that his family could not afford them. His family believed that having crooked teeth was not that big of an issue.
I find it very funny that the government does not want to talk about these issues. They tend to sweep racial injustice under the rug. They almost feel like it will eventually work itself out.
It seems as though, in America, this issue has been covered up time and time again. No effective action is taking place.
So to the inbred white guy down south who flies a confederate flag and sports a Nazi youth haircut, we are so much better than all black and brown majority countries.
I cannot believe that we just all of a sudden appeared on this earth one day exactly like this.
I understood the true argument of his lecture equal, corresponding evolution.
It is brought up to my attention. I believe that sports are inherently racist.
Some US citizens don't seem to realize or want to acknowledge the fact that almost the entire western part of the country was once Mexico.
It will just change its form.
We have no actual culture that is our own. You could count black Friday sales/ supersized fast food meals.
The reason I chose to talk about when Sam talked about the Black Italians is simple. I can easily relate to what he is saying.
Some examples that come to mind are police brutality, gentrification, Islamophobia.
I believe a student brought up the thought. It may have been because of their economic status.
I remember. During this lecture Sam pointed out that the guy who was doing the grouping mainly looked at skin color.
It truly saddens me to see how ineffective the media can make something. It concerns me with regards to how messages can be spread in the future.
People come from all types of places. They are going to have different opinions about things.
I'm like the volunteer Sam picked. I would've also assumed both girls were from the same region.
I found this question and answer to be very interesting as well.
It was eye opening to me as it was to you. When Sam was talking about the different features of people. From different parts of Africa.
I believe this representation had multiple meanings.
From a scientific perspective, people, having a dark skin tone, are able to counteract absorbing too much UV rays. Avoid the risk of getting skin cancer.
When you take the case of the Chinese and Koreans, these differences can be noticed only when you are in a group consisting of both of them.
They are all wealthy is the reason why. They wouldn't be caught dead serving tables at a restaurant.
Hopefully that made sense. I hope I didn't miss your point.
We are most certainly not the center of the universe. We are not certainly not the greatest country in the world.
Multiracial/mixed race people are now growing three times faster than the entire United States population.
How can a person discriminate against someone if they do not know where they are from?
Racism is ever present in the USA. Because of our history with slavery through the civil rights movement, and the genocide of natives, we are in a very rocky terrain.
Yes, it might seem annoying. Its all we see in the news. It is necessary.
Only that it has taken a new form within this country.
Looking at someone who is a different race than me, I tend to notice it.
That makes people angry. A group of people feel (and are) they are being wronged.
The conversation  continued. I realized just  how deep the United States racial problems are.
This elite group shouldn't exist. We should all be on the same playing field. That's not the case.
Cardiovascular endurance is not inherited from your relatives. It takes practice. It takes a lot of intense training to build your endurance up.
Hockey is more dominated by white people. There are blacks.
Without that experience, we don't really know anything about those people, despite what we may think.
If I know how a teacher or professor is going to grade an essay or what they like to see in a paper I will cater my writing towards their preference. This way I can get a good grade even if it is not something I like or agree with.
So I basically have no clue where I'm really from.
I thought it was based on a true story. I did not know at all that it was a real-life tribe in America.
Race is a topic that certainly needs to be discussed. It needs discussion even starting from a young age.
I find it really interesting. View it in a genetics point of view. Sam did.
This creates no constructive content. It will discourage others from speaking their mind freely.
Many news outlets choose to cover the hate crimes and rallies around the United States. These include the Charlottesville rally and the Facebook Live killer.
I learned of these events in school growing up. Nobody ever taught us about Native Americans in a violent context.
They were created with a purpose behind them.
The activity also reinforced the idea that the eye shape is one of the key physical features one can use to help identify ancestry.
As Sam said, there's a lot to talk about when it comes to race. The best way to understand is to keep the discussion going with an open mind.
Before taking this class I had no clue at all about how your facial features can help determine where you are from. I think that it is super interesting.
It also helped me see that we are really all connected the same way.
This never stopped me from having friends of other races. It definitely sheltered me from my country's discrimination and outlook of those of color and other ethnicities. This election being the first I really followed led me to ask the same question. Why is race such a big deal in the United States?
My friends have experienced the negative effects from it. I see the awful things that happen in the news.
A single country wont be able to stop racism. Even if its only in one place it can easily spread.
Hockey is a much more expensive sport. It excludes a lot people from poorer foreign countries.
I don't think I'm alone when I say that I don't often stop to think about the blatant fact that our country is founded on the mass killings of indigenous people. This leads me to think that I'm just part of the majority of people who also don't acknowledge this.
This is one reason I say this. Race can easily be used to target someone.
I was also being not expecting the girl Melanie to say she was very comfortable.
This is where the entire sports/ comparing peoples body types conversation became interesting.
This problem could be erased if more people were to travel around. They should go see things for themselves. They should do that instead of just accepting the opinion and vision of someone else.
Sam begins to tap. Comparing the difference between Basketball, the difference between hockey.
Try asking a black person what sports they like, they never say hockey or baseball. Their culture just does not like those sports. The majority of their race does not like that sport, why would the play it?
I am listening to Sam's statement about color pigmentation. It is interesting. I see the social implications of a biological factor.
When Sam started talking about the crooked teeth. I connected right away. I was able to understand the point he was trying to make.
I didnt know if that was polite.
Her parents did absolutely everything. She pretty much had to learn how to think by herself.
It was interesting to hear Sam Richards telling us about it. How we can take a glimpse at where we are from based on our facial features.
A human being cannot learn and develop if he was close to himself.
Sports relate more to economic standing than race. Towns that have more money can afford to have things such as ice hockey rinks in their schools. Poorer towns cannot.
must include clauses that state they will not discriminate based on race/ religion/ ethic background/gender.
I couldnt tell you anything about any other countrys constitution. It amazed me that some young child could.
I also did not express much sympathy for them.
It sounds weird. It is true.
The other part is the stigma people feel they may face.
I thought that it was really interesting. There were some people that were Hispanic. If they would have never mentioned it, I would have never guessed that they were Latinos.
The scientific mindset of the 17th century is still living and thriving today. It has allowed for atrocious groups like Richard Spencer's to exist.
And I definitely agree with you that race has become such a sensitive subject. People no longer want to discuss it in fear of being called out as being offensive or racist.
I could not agree with you more.
This problem has to derive from some history in the past.
I see this white supremacist view everywhere I go in this country.
I was very surprised that any of them were correctly grouped.
I find that these thoughts are not necessarily ones that only certain individuals possess. Stereotyping has been passed down generation after generation.
They gave me a perspective I had not had all my life. Not all places are diverse. Not everyone is used to having people of different ethnicities around them.
I definitely believe in the science of evolution. I just don't know if a god was involved.
It is backed up by science and research done by people who devoted their lives to these topics. To me, the theory of evolution makes sense.
All humans share 99.9% of the same DNA. Why does it even matter o be in an interracial relationship?
This opens the doorway to people being less sensitive about these traits. Everyone has specific things that they are embarrassed about.
There are a lot of race issues going on in the world and so much controversy, especially with African Americans and cops. I think that people bringing the attention to this issue that still exists in America is a good thing.
It's unfortunate for them as time goes on. They will eventually and inevitably be outnumbered.
It starts off by talking about evolution. When you think of it at the end, it's is a picture of a white man.
Although it is less confrontational than public speaking, sharing your opinion is brave no matter where it takes place.
Here at Penn State, it seems to get brought up every time I meet someone new at a party.
In high school, I competed in junior golf tournaments all over the east coast. I noticed the amount of black participants was below 10.
I also very prominently choose not to participate in that racism. I do not agree with it what so ever.
The fact that this would concern me at all is very disappointing. It has no place in society.
Race is the reason for some issues in the world. It should be discussed for the purpose of solving those problems.
The police wrongfully killed a black man. There was violence at a white supremacist rally. Racial tensions are impossible to ignore.
I believe in evolution. I also grew up with a lot of white Christian classmates who didnt.
In class we discussed how Hockey is predominately white.
Like Sam said in lecture, there are great arguments for both sides of this discussion.
Then, Sam said that the body, mind and spirit are all linked everywhere in the same possible way. I realized that he was right.
Meanwhile, there are just as many groups arguing otherwise. Everyone should be seen and treated as equals despite all race, gender, and any identity differences.
I think the two sides to this argument are too polarized. They should maybe try to meet in the middle. They should compromise in saying that a creator of some sort probably guided the evolutionary process.
I like in your response how you included your personal experience with cultural shock.
A point brought out in lecture that I never thought much about. The United States School system we are only taught to focus on the wonderful accomplishments of our nation. Our nation was not solely built on those wonderful accomplishments.
Recently, asians have been dominating golf at all levels.
I think all, if not most of us, have that one relative in our family who comes from an older generation. They have some racist views towards certain groups of people.
I always thought of race problems as the reality of the world in which we live. This question made me step back and think. Maybe it's not a reality that has to do with the world. Maybe it's a reality that has to do with the United States alone.
Yeah, I can say African American. Me personally, I find that term confusing for people who are actually African/have knowledge of their ties to Africa and are American. Do you see what I'm saying?
Using the students to show how the Alt Right view and categorize humans helped me understand their thought process. I understand even if I do not agree with it.
In the next group, there was a half Italian women. Because of her Japanese mother, her skin appeared lighter and less Italian. She was therefore grouped separately.
I have very similar views on this question to Casey.
People think being a pure native makes them better.
We cannot just assume that one group is fundamentally higher than another group based off of appearances. That is not accurate.
I cannot always write what I want or what I believe in. It's because I'm writing to get a good grade.
The goal of sociology is to promote thinking/ discussions. Social media does a great job of allowing everyone to do so.
I could easily relate to everything the Italian girl was saying in class.
People that were less mathematically or scientifically gifted, less politically savvy, just generally less intelligent had darker skin. I know a lot of white people that should be pitch black.
Our culture is unique. We're the only Asian country whose main religion is Catholic. Our culture more closely identifies with Spanish than other Asians.
I think that race is an important topic. It should be discussed.
It is so true. Reading opens up students so much more. It allows the students to learn while reading into something they are interested in.
Spanish speaking countries, like Venezuela and Columbia, the majority in power are white. Those cleaning the houses and serving the food have darker skin tones.
Sam asked a white girl to point out the darkest person in the room. I felt super uncomfortable.
How come my friend is never referred to as Asian/ white?
We look different. We're all the same.
If someone likes another person's personality, they instantly become more attractive. This is despite their race and ethnicity.
I liked how Sam brought up his firsthand experiences in India and Columbia. The student who spoke in class might not have had as much insight into the issue as Sam does.
Sometimes people just need to sit back. They need to listen, not talk about a topic they know nothing about.
It was wrong for people to attack Hayden. He was brave enough to get up in front of the class. He voiced his thoughts.
In class we talked about how everyone is 99.9% the same. Not one person is limited to strengths in a certain sport.
It made me really happy to discover from the military speaker that he liked working with civilians. He didn't have a prejudice against them.
You need to read into the deeper reason. Why does one race succeeds more than another?
I think this class helps to take away some awkwardness when talking about race. It also makes us more aware that they constantly surround us.
This is where multi varied social interactions come into play. Meeting a diverse group of people can accentuate this understanding.
When I ask my parents, they will list 10 or more different regions that my ancestors are from. I would love to actually know the details of the story behind my genes.
The The United States is a big melting pot of different religious beliefs, races, ethnicities. This vastly contributes to why we bring up race often.
It made me think that praying is less of a religious act. It's more of a reflective or spiritual experience.
We need to humble ourselves. There are people wealthier than us. There are people poorer than us.
You also see a lot of professional swimmers from places like Florida, or parts of California, where it is common to have pools open year round.
Just having one person be affected by this type of conversation is a step in the right direction.
The Civil Rights Movements have definitely given a louder voice to those of color and other minorities. Until everyone decides to fight for one equal path, then we will always be at battle with inequality and unfairness.
In conclusion, I certainly believe that sports are not inherently racist.
Tiger Woods proved to everyone that a black man can play professional golf and be successful. There has only been 1 black player to join the professional golf tour since 2011.
On the other hand, it would be dishonest to pretend that racial issues don't exist in our country.
It depends on where your grow up, who youre raised by, etc.
We are never shown the people who are thriving.
Many people are not cultured enough to see. People have made flaws in every ethnicity.
I have been all around the country. I have never been outside of it.
There is absolutely no evidence to prove that these claims are true. Honestly those who do make claims such as these are most likely uneducated about racial differences and human biology as a whole.
On the other hand, I believe this shows how close we are in society.
If we all viewed this evolution diagram how Sam discussed it, perhaps there could be more advancement in this thought proccess. Black Lives Matter and other movements may not need be a thing in the future. We wouldn't value the white race over others like some supporters of the All Lives Matter movement do.
I also like that political boundaries were discussed.
Our history is long. It is complicated. It is ugly, just like many other countries in the world. We are unwilling to recognize that we also stooped to such levels to build this beautiful country.
Even though the volunteers from the video were all African and had some similarities. Each person was unique in different ways.
I am a white girl. I enjoy white privilege. Why is it uncomfortable to me?
To me, there is very little for us to be proud of in this country. The exception is our music and film industries.
I come from an Italian family. I have a different experience than what Sam described.
I personally thought that everyone in third world countries was living on the streets/ struggling.
I  do not think this is always the case.
We talk about it so much. Why are there still so many issues when it comes to race?
He told me not to sweat it. Even he has trouble telling the differences between other Asian people.
The difference between the melting pot of people in India and the United States is their way of dealing with race discrimination.
It is unfair. There are so many individuals with this mentality.
There really are not an abundance of people who are not white.
Reading is absolutely other way to discover the world around us.
I do believe that some races are better at particular sports than others. It is more of a cultural thing in society today.
In the same class, a kid who raised his hand didn't want to refer to a student in the front as black. He just said, the guy in the red shirt.
It might just be subjective. I have always been curious.
Comedian Ali Wong cites Asian stereotypes in her shows to show that they are ridiculous.
Each volunteer was from the same continent. They look completely different. They have very unique traits.
With that said, I do not think sports are racist.
The social media aspect of this class. Gives students the opportunity to share their opinions. To connect to one another.
Her parents paid everything. She didn't really know how to do much on her own.
That is something. I have really learned it in college.
This might sound foolish. There are many different types of living organisms, life forms, species, etc.
Sure, it would not hurt to have good genetics. That is not a deciding factor in your potential athleticism.
Someone from the north might play hockey. Someone in the south may not have an ice rink.
African students in India are terrorized.
I do believe that education is a very simple solution to this thought process.
Another example brought up in the video was how athletes who play hockey are completely different.
I dont believe that physical traits determine what kind of person you are. Many people do.
So far, we're only doing one of those two things.
I liked hearing the student in this video discuss his stance on the subject. Sam's conclusion and afterthoughts with his firsthand experiences should stand out.
It is not just something white people do.
I agree I loved this. I thought it was a lot of fun.
It's not possible to change everyone's mindsets. We can change some people's negative actions/ words.
These organizations are usually for different nationalities or ethnicities. The new students can find a new sense of inclusion. They are comforted when coming to a new country for school
The training in Canada is potentially better. It originated there. Most children are put in the sport from a young age because of its popularity.
It's not the race that makes them better than another. It might be the cultural background. It might be how you grew up with your particular sport.
Every time I speak to someone from a Latin American country, I know exactly where he/ she is from.
This means that you can never really be sure about what will set someone off.
Racism and ignorance will never completely go away. Constantly discussing it can change the minds of generation after generation.
I did a response on the nose of different people which was interesting to me. It relates as well as hockey and body shapes and sizes.
I think there are those who are against such mixing.
I think there's only one way to properly address the issues of race. It is through a forum with people talking with other people.
Going along with my own discovery, I think some people could be uncomfortable. Sam is so quick to point out characteristics on people.
Yet, people still seem to have this idea in the back of their head. That white people are really the most evolved.
If any person, of any race, feels a connection with another human, then they should be allowed to be together without having other people think of them any differently than if it was a same race relationship period!
The sad fact is racism is all over. A clear example of this is racism against Mario Balotelli. He is an Italian soccer player, who had racist slurs yelled at him at numerous matches in his career. It happened in his match against Roma.
To really feel/ have a motivation to change we need to be more connected to world news not just whats happening in the United States.
I think in so many ways, sports are the exact opposite of racist. They bring people together.
It is important to understand. The world has been intermingling and changing since the dawn of time. It is only natural for it to do so now.
The BLM movement preaches equal rights. Equal rights is altruistic. Black lives label themselves advocates. They already create a separation.
How could that be true? Every person is different. Every person goes through different experiences.
Social medias have the potential of bringing people closer. Social media poses potential threats of cyber bullying and hate.
African Americans are usually the ones that excel in basketball compared to all other races. White Canadians are the best hockey players. Dominicans are associated with baseball.
It is a feature that helps them. It should never be used to morally hurt them.
It seems that many people are having trouble seeing that culture will never stay the same. It is ok for it to change.
She was very, very sensitive. I do not put up with that.
I lived in Japan. People were treating me as if I were exotic.
Like that black people are genetically predisposed to commit crimes, or that their inferior genetics were the reason why it was so easy to enslave them.
We took land that was not rightfully ours. We killed the people it belonged to.
If there had been a civilization of many different races all put together. I'm positive that the generations after them would all consider each other the same. They would not have any culture barrier between them.
It may have been by accident. He got a good amount of the groups correct.
A key factor to consider is the differences in culture among whites and blacks.
I thought it was really interesting that a student brought up how Pocahontas. A movie that most kids of my generation know, was one of the last tribes to be considered federally recognized.
In early high school, I had a friend who is Jamaican. He talked about how it annoyed him. People refer to all black people as African American.
I travel to Mexico every year. Throughout the years, I have noticed that there has been a small change in the different races living up there.
In my opinion this mindset is why racism has been able to prevail heavily.
I also think that utilizing social media to influence class discussions is a great idea. Only so many people can get to speak over the mic in every class. It's a great way for Sam's team to be able to sift through and get the general gist of how people are feeling about a certain topic and gauge frequent questions.
I called my mom to ask her about why. She explained that is just how he was raised. It was what the people of his town in Italy believed too.
I think its crazy how Americans really believe they are the best/ richest country in the world.
I find the topic of race to be very interesting.
It is not just something white Americans do.
In 2017, the KKK should not legally be allowed to hold meetings/ gatherings.
The speaker was then criticized on Twitter by some other students .
Everybody maturing/ knowing that we are all truly the same/ homosapiens. The world would operate with significantly more cohesion.
Dating between races is not very common in my hometown either.
At the end of the day we look the way we do; eyes, nose, hair etc.
At the same time, it is a very sensitive subject to some people. It should be handled with extreme care.
I think golf is a racist sport. That aspect of the game is decreasing. More opportunities are opening up to minority involvement.
There are many nice areas. The showing area that was shown in class is one.
There is no practical way to control the content of the comments of a user on social media.
I too thought this activity was really interesting!
I was hesitant to put this post up. I did it anyway!
It showed the reason why where you grow up/ are born has a large impact on who you are. Over time humans who live in specific areas tend to look the same.
It was nice to see Jefton attempt to group people together according to their background based solely off of their appearances.
Thinking about it some more, I understand why it affects them on an emotional level.
Why can't people acknowledge that this country was built off the backs of slave?
I believe that it is more of a cultural thing. It's like Professor Richards stated in the video.
The debate around it is one of the largest in the world. This means that it is definitely important to see both sides of it.
Sam mentioned how awesome a students nose was due to the shape/ size. I felt uncomfortable
The point of this class to hear from people of different races/religions/ethnicities. We come together and combat racism and stereotypes that exist in our word.
Basketball can simply be played with one single round ball and a hoop. They can be found at almost any local playground in America.
This country was founded to have the freedom to choose and practice whatever religion you wanted to. Clearly this meaning is lost upon them.
People who believe in both sides of the argument are definitely very passionate about it. It is important to know what both arguments are/ the bases of them.
Specifically, the comments towards the end did a good job of wrapping up. There can be demographic differences that can lead to certain sports being pursued or players being idolized.
Of course, we don't live in a perfect world. Racism will forever exist. We can educate people. Whether you're black, Asian, or Guatemalan, we are all 99.9% the same.
Racism is everywhere. Other countries hide it better than others. If you listen to conversations, even for an hour, you can hear the racism.
Lebron James could be good at any sport if he wanted to. Cultural factors led him to choose basketball.
Itd most likely be in suit of him grumbling something about the ignorance of white folk.
We see it in the form of Black Lives Matter. Police brutality, campus protests, and various other avenues.
It was interesting to see how even some people from Africa could not tell wheat parts of Africa other Africans were from.
Right now, many people are basing their opinions of the other side. Solely on the radical minority. Which gives them very skewed opinions.
I too would have been awful at placing the students into their respective groups.
It may have been beneficial thousands of years ago. Society should have progressed to where that logic is unnecessary or detrimental.
To say that someone is sexist due to only liking certain races is ridiculous.
These two examples show why there is not intentional racism in sports.
At the core, a sport has to appeal to the individual. The individual is the one who makes the commitment.
Even with groups that started just or have good intentions.
Peoples genetics tend to mirror wherever their ancestors for.
I was under the assumption that there was no way for me to have any idea where my ancestors were from. It is kind of cool to know that there is a way to at least make an educated guess on the subject. Possibly, be able to at least know what area of Africa that my family came from.
Sam continues to talk about looking at people and knowing where they are usually from. I can't help but wonder more and more about my own family's history.
A black man was becoming the face of a white man's sport. It pissed off the upper class, racist white audience.
Sam brings up a topic that I think is the answer to this. It might be culture.
I believe that different environments and characteristics go into influencing certain people to play specific sports.
We are considered a land of many opportunities. Equality is not shown within those opportunities. Despite what is written in our constitution.
I think people need to bring light of racial equality to these type of people. Show them were more alike than they think. There's nothing wrong with it.
I am very much concerned about the issues of race in this country. I have seen, in media, many instances of inequality during recent years.
This is a really interesting topic in my opinion. I believe it is encouraging of what race relations might be like. In the next few decades.
I would not worry about dating outside my race. I personally would not care what other people think.
She asked me that question. I started to pay attention to how she interacted with her family.
With that being said, we also should not be whipping out the race card every chance we get. That only hurts the relationships amongst races.
No one talks about how we barely even know who we vote for on ballots. Everything must be an open election.
Grades do put the students down along with the state testing.
Many people I know don't believe in any other option. Then they shame me for having the same options.
Imagine me at five years old watching New York Giants games with my father/ brothers.
I think this is very relatable. Nowadays you see many mixed races all around the world.
It doesn't mean we should stop talking about race.
I think the accessibility of this class via Twitter is what makes the class feel so free as to say what you think towards what Sam has to say.
In the class alone, we had more than six groups of different nationalities. Even those groups were very broad.
This was the video I chose to talk about. We agree on a few key points.
People in privileged parts of the country seem to forget that.
I believe that these ranks were more determined by the hatred that the Alt Right people feel towards these individual groups.
People have seen Afghanistan on the news. Thats how they form their opinion.
Like Sam said, it just depends on what they grew up playing. This is why sport is related to culture. This makes it a sociology topic.
Richard Spencer thinks the exact way I feel.
At certain times, things may seem racially divided and racist in general. t This class aims to answer the
It is important to start these conversations at an early age. Children can develop a proper understanding of race relations.
I see this. A case that does a good job of presenting. This class is based on the pursuit of understanding the social dynamics between different cultures.
I used to be a huge advocate of thinking that America was the best country in the world. In some aspects, I still do. I think when you look at statistics you can realize we fall behind other countries in many aspects, including GDP per capita.
I think a lot of what they are doing involves race baiting. They flood the news with cases of racism. This makes it seem racism is a bigger issue than what it really is.
I hear people referring to getting with another race. It is almost as if they use it to brag. It's uncommon for this to happen.
When pointed out people could assume this is saying that the Black race is the least evolved, then Asians, then Whites being the most evolved. It doesn't seem right to me.
The lecture I posted about focused on the traits of Africans.
Not everything is black and white.
It makes you think how different we are. We are similar at the same time.
Coming to Penn State was such a change for me, but it taught me so much.
This lecture did a great job. It made students think differently about physical differences. Each and every person in the room is a product of their ancestors evolutionary characteristics.
Kristen, I totally agree with the last statement in your first paragraph. You say talking about race too much is causing it to be more prevalent.
In my response, I stated that open discussion would go a long way to combat racism. I fully agree that schools should do a better job in educating students on the origins of racist attitudes.
Both sides of my family are looked down on. People think they aren't real Americans. We've been here for decades.
Understanding each other is the key to ending racism. I have to start there.
All of that is amplified in America.
I assume that there are a lot of people that acknowledge that other communities have different worldviews. A lot of people are interested in learning about them. Many cannot afford to travel to those places.
I want to add that if people cannot afford traveling, they can alter to books.
It was quite humbling hearing my fellow classmates varied responses to the question. All the valid reasons I never even knew existed.
A little bit closer to home was the 2016 election. That revitalized the racial tension embedded in this country's history.
I very much agree with you. Your point on leaving your bubble was agreeable.
Many people will not want to accept that we are all the same.
You can examine different races. You can look at the millions of varying features we have. Differences can be viewed on the outside. Humans all encompass the same minds and consciousness.
I believe that the sports you play are heavily influenced by those around you.
People try to get into an argument about sports being racist. I think of the Little League World Series. It just finished about two weeks ago.
I paired up with the girl sitting next to me. ]I had zero clue the answer to how many Native American tribes are federally recognized.
She never wanted to eat by herself or walk around alone. This is something you have to learn in college like come on.
It was interesting to me. I believe that race in sports is a typical thing to stereotype and categorize. Though, we rarely look at the root causes of such differences.
When asked about these other issues, type D people will assume their ideology belief is automatically correct without looking at both sides of the conflict.
He talks about how nowadays, many people are mixed race. If this continues, it is going to be the future.
Sports are not inherently racist. What sport you play has nothing to do with your race. what sport you play has to do with the culture in which you were raised.
The girls in the video weren't made uncomfortable by Sam. He drew attention to their facial features.
Both professional basketball players/ professional hockey players are extremely athletic. They work hard to be strong/ quick/ agile.
I think that the world becoming more mixed over time will lead to less discrimination.
I like how you describe the racial injustices instilled in Chinese culture.
However, there are both black and white people in the NHL and NBA. That is not always the case.
We need to analyze how our government is actually working. Is it for the people or for the people at the top?
I like what Brian Davis had to say on this topic.
People are thoughtful, smart and creative everywhere. They're like the little kids shining shoes. It is our human nature to be that way.
This shows that people are just uninformed about many things regarding race.
We went on vacation together over the summer. My skin was darker than his. No one called would refer to me as black, just very tan.
I have made some of my best friends (who are black) playing sports with them.
I was at first shocked/ appalled. None of these things are true.
We should talk openly and honestly about race and our perceptions of racism as it exists today. It will go a long way in getting over those problems.
Sam actually clarified in class that this idea wouldn't work. African Americans don't make up the biggest part of the lower class.,
Being caucasian, I come from the other side of things. I did grow up in a town with a large Asian population.
I think the disparities are greatly influenced by culture. Sam touched on it in the video.
The war on drugs, the water on native Americans, etc. focus on specific issues. They target different groups of people. This leaves them feeling attacked or vulnerable.
It's almost like this class is my source of news. I really don't watch the mainstream news either.
One must be weary when discussing these race topics though. Different people are offended by different types of things.
It is normal to just think that one person is higher than another based off of appearances and based off of facial features.
You have made a few interesting points. I agree with some of those points. I do not agree with some of those points.
You can't deny the history of sports. It is clear that racism was very much present in sports like hockey and baseball.
I've never really thought much about this question. It really makes me think why it's such an important topic to learn about.
He explained that, like Adonnas hair, our bodies are all products of our ancestors environments.
Education combined with discourse is the ideal pairing to alleviate racism.
This liberal feels. Less government regulation would create more jobs. Less government regulation would spur economic growth.
The media depicts all muslims are bad. They base it on a really small percentage of muslim group. It is not the case.
This nation was founded on racism, hatred, and white supremacy.
This would come under the realm of sociobiology. A biological concept has affected people over the ages. These differences have changed the extent of human interactions.
In our discussion group, we talked a big deal about this. Our history makes us unique when it comes to separation, division, and or segregation.
Sticking with hockey, it is difficult to put an ice rink in the middle of a city. You can usually find an already established park. With a basketball hoop where kids can practice on.
It really all depends on what sport the athlete decides to play. That decision is usually determined by culture.
People may have different traditions and celebrate different holidays. They are all essentially the same. Look past some of the cultural differences.
I believe that we are all different in many ways. Skin color does not define the way we should treat other people.
One response stuck out to me above others. It was how the creation of certain cities purposefully disenfranchised a majority of its poor. This was a more ethnic population.
I haven't been affected by racism. I understand that racism is a huge problem.
In talking about race, what are we really saying?
The volunteers may have been from a similar part of the world. They were all very different in so many beautiful and important ways. That should be recognized.
I don't know. I would fully classify myself as Atheist. I never really think about religion.
People say don't just a book by its cover. We do it anyway.
In the future, the black kids will follow black athletes. This develops into the pattern that we see today.
I agree with everything you said on this post!
I was very intrigued when Sam brought up an interesting viewpoint. He lined all three girls up in straight line in a row.
To prove this point last week Sam brought multiple African Americans to the front of the room. He asked them questions. Their responses were so different but yet they had the same skin color.
In elementary and middle school, no one seemed to care.
Dr. Richards is very adept at making hard topics easy to talk about. I think he shows that skill in this lecture above all others.
Traveling/ having an open mind to see how other people live is how we will move forward.
Unfortunately, our commander in chief has incited nothing but bigotry and hatred. Our commander in chief made it seem acceptable for everyone to be ignorant towards one another.
You inherit physical characteristics from your ancestors. You are born into the cultural environment that your parents set up.
Race could not be the reason of an issue. It is an easy target to pick on, people choose to target race.
Type E people should not be criticized for admitting they are uninformed on certain issues. Type E people should be commended for not falling into the trap of simply taking the same stance that is accepted by their ideology.
I believe that culture continues on.
This made sense to me. I agreed with Morgan Freeman. Sometimes the emphasis on race may be too much.
Only by listening to one another will we begin to understand each other.
However, some of these differences are amplified more than others.
I was relieved. My parents and family members did not care what race he was. All they cared for was that  he treated me with respect as they would want any guy to.
I thought this was very interesting.
Other countries seem to accapt their racist past. A large  portion of our country today denies that race is even an issue.
This is a result of all the years of living in one place.
However, I believe that the good that comes from Sam integrating Twitter into his class heavily outweighs the bad. The bad is why I'm probably never going to raise my hand or volunteer for activities in class.
We discussed the body shapes. how black people have longer legs a shorter torso. That is why we see more black people running track/ running short distance races.
I believe that all of those opinions are stereotypes.
Morgan Freemans solution to the racial divide was to stop labeling people black/ white/ hispanic. Just identify people by their name.
I liked Sams statement. He said that people are thriving in all parts of the world. He said we, as Americans, still have this idea that all of Africa is poor. There has been that stigma for a while.
There are a significant amount of Black players in the NBA than there are white by a big margin.
I looked at the same video. I didn't pick up on the dehumanizing effects of racism.
I agree with this in one aspect. I would be nervous to be put on the spot in front of a lecture that large.
I know I was at first.
On my mother's side, my grandmother immigrated to the United States. She left my family behind.
I also agree. No group has the right to say that they are better than another group. Genetically, we are not.
If the networks hosted more professional debates and invited more speakers to explain their stance or views calmly and clearly, people may be more informed on the topics. Discussions about race issues would be much more productive.
The event that happened in Charlottesville shows the ignorance of knowledge of human history.
All in all, we should talk about race more. To be completely honest, this class so far has furthered my thinking about other races. I feel like I am more comfortable already talking about race.
He has a philosophy background. That's what he uses to motivate his stance.
That was wrong of people to do. I dont think its any reason to not use social media as much anymore in class.
If you visit any other place in the world. People there will not be as open to talk about race and race issues. They don't have much experience with dealing with people of different backgrounds and cultures.
This is a remarkable example of biology. It's directly influencing our psychological opinions.
He has been all over the world. I'm looking forward to hearing what other experiences he had in foreign countries.
I agree once again with your response. Social media really opens doors in Sociology 119.
One of the volunteers in class discussed how Kenyans had better cardiovascular endurance than other races.
I believe people from the US are very unaware that there is racism in other parts of the world. That's why Sam brought this up.
It's very interesting to know that both parties involved feel this way. It really made me wonder if the government should be fighting wars like this. Altering the courses of millions of lives over what seems to be very poor reasoning.
They aren't wrong. They are just trying to attract the attention of people who refuse to listen.
Why is it that the African American culture is underrepresented in the culture of Greek life?
This goes to show how people have moved all over the world from where their ancestors were originally from.
I think that what Brian said was very important. He gives historical evidence as to why people still see race as a major component in American society.
I like how Sam ends this video. He discusses India's caste system by describing their ladder of power between people. He discusses Columbia's similar viewpoint on racial topics being discussed too much.
Personally, I think that dating outside your race is a great way to immerse yourself into different cultures. It helps a lot with understanding people from different backgrounds.
If you are white and walk into a black neighborhood they are going to look at you as if they are better than you. They will see that you don't belong there.
Politicians may portray certain ethnicities themselves. Politicians may show they are ready to protect us.
This country was founded and built by immigrants.
There is inherently a race issue no matter where you are in the world. America just tends to speak about it more for many reasons.
The part of lecture Matching Ancestor Groups was something I could personally relate to.
I totally agree with this. I felt a little uncomfortable at those points too. I liked that no one seemed to be upset about it.
Everyone knows what a racist is/ what a racist believes, right?
Appearances and external features have nothing to do with who we are as people. Appearances and external features have to do with simply where our ancestors are from geographically.
I grew up in Philadelphia. I was surrounded by a mix of black and white kids growing up.
We learned about Christopher Columbus. We never were given the gruesome details about wiping them out.
I was able to experience this myself.
I received these types of questions the older I got. This was especially when I started college.
Sam was correct. He said that we've never gotten past some of the racial issues of the Civil Rights era/ before.
I found this really interesting as well. I started to wonder what little traits relate back to my ancestry.
I personally have learned much more through this class. I learned by talking to people who have been affected by this issue. I learned more than through any of my previous years in school.
I did my post on the same video. I had a similar viewpoint.
On one hand, it shows that we as a country are very diverse. We are from different areas around the world.
It is a shame. It causes all of this separation. It's just because we look, talk, or think different.
I always thought People should admit that slavery was a complete atrocity. It really only happened because it could. It was not because one race was actually better than the other.
I like how Sam points out how distinct physical features can differentiate one ancestry from the next. He reminds everyone that, regardless of these appearance of backgrounds, we're all the same.
In my discussion group, we have talked a lot about race. The question, is everyone a little racist?
Reading this response to the discussion, I began to find that I agreed with every single point written.
The other student was much shorter. They had a longer torso.
My moms whole side of the family is pure bred Italian.
The civil rights movement made racism a big deal. It's good it did. People were and are still speaking out about racism in this country.
The topic I found to be the most interesting. Sports being inherently racist.
I believe that people tend to be attracted to certain types of people. They don't intentionally exclude a certain race from their dating habits.
Racism is not super obvious in my family. I do not have an uncle. He spews racial slurs. He says politically incorrect statements over Christmas dinner. (for lack of a better term) statements over Christmas dinner.
It's new to hear it from a sociology background.
For the longest time I thought that was just kind of a white people thing. We had a hard time telling the difference between people from different asian countries.
I believe that is where the United States currently is at.
We should talked less about tragedies. Worked harder to educate one another. Voice our opinions in a more respectful manner. We would be able to reach solutions much faster and easier.
It's a lot cheaper to play basketball than hockey. Maybe the case is about where families stand economically. In our minds as a society, I think people generally believe African Americans make up a lot of the lower class.
Do I think that certain traits are acquired through ones environment versus genetics?
Sam then raised another interesting point. Race seems like a bigger issue in the United States than in other countries because of how much we talk about.
Us, the young generation, seeing that was a wake up call to all of us. We are all just people struggling to do well in college/ to become successful in the future.
I never fully grasped. Racism is a big deal. I got older. I started to see. how discriminating and barbarous people can be.
Some members of my family consider themselves to be very religious. I have been around people like this my whole life.
I thought it was interesting. Sam talked about the notorious racist Italian grandparents.
I think all cultures are interesting. I love learning about where people are from.
I really liked listening to this topic. I don't think many of us really understood why some sports are dominated by a certain race.
These genetics are would give advantages athletically. Consider the Olympics.
What is the history in United States? It made race such a big deal.
Maybe it also depends on the person. Sometimes introducing your race and culture to a person can be a hit or miss. Some people just aren't interested in learning or find our traditions odd. I've dealt with that before.
I was taught that history didn't remember anyone who looked like me. Thus, I assumed they didn't exist.
I however do not agree with the violence it has brought. I do believe that is doing nothing more than creating bigger problems for our country.
The fact that the discovery of America is still celebrated absolutely baffles me.
I agree that the media does play a role in giving you these false interpretations of other countries.
Sports had always been a love of mine. So much that I hadn't really every considered them racist. They are too pure.
Unfortunately, I grew up in an area in Bucks County, PA where about 90% of the students at my high school were white.
There is no one single Latino look.
I think that is an important question to ask.
The media does not represent the world accurately at all!
That is universal and not from a particular race. Some people see it that way.
With the question being if we speak about race too much really depends on how it's spoken about.
There wasnt any huge significance but it was noticeable. It was even more significant when I turned on the TV. When I watched professional sports games
People never talk about race. I feel that there are many high class people that feel a strange tension when they are talking with people of different social statuses.
That is why traveling can give you that view that what you once saw is not the same as when you are experiencing or seeing it in your own eyes.
We are all people and it is important to learn that early and often.
I always wondered why that was.
As an immigrant in my community, it just made me wonder which one of my neighbors had disliked me and my family this whole time.
When asked to find a difference between the two, you could tell in their eyes that they were thinking very hard about it.
Another factor playing into all of this is that the United States is one of the most diverse countries in the world.
In America, there are vast amounts of Brown, Asian, Black, White, Native American and any other race. People notice differences more and talk about it.
That is what they know from a young age.
Human beings are beautiful creatures. I think it is high time we start accepting people for who they are. And become more aware of the implications we make. When we as a society group people together by skin color because that is not what should define us.
I believe that everyone is created equal no matter what race, gender, ethnicity, etc.
Watching him point out small things like an eye fold that someone has was intriguing.
How can we move on as a country? We still are supporting racism in so many ways. These historical monuments.
I never really noticed it until Dr. Sam pointed it out.
It is important to expose yourself to other cultures. You as an individual in society can grow as a human being, and not be ignorant to the world around you.
Using a sociological lens to take a closer look at this, it's interesting that we're always noticing these things. Often subliminally, and yet no one likes to start these conversations.
Basketball was and still is a very big game in the south. A larger portion of african american families live there.
I believe over 65 languages were spoken at my high school.
Part of the problem with racism is that fact that people get misinformation. They create these stereotypes.
It is true the United States has progressed tremendously. Race is prevailing in our daily lives.
It takes a lot of courage to get up in front of such a big classroom like Thomas, and speak your opinion on these controversial topics.
Honestly, I am not really sure what an Armenian person looks like other than the Kardashians. I really hope I do not look anything similar to them.
Being encouraged to look carefully at each others features for clues to our ancestry groups is intriguing. It was clear from the activity. It isn't that straightforward.
I think the United States is different from India, Venezuela and Colombia. We are more of a racial melting pot than those countries.
There could be plenty of explanations for this topic. This is what I believe. My experience is based on playing different sports.
Using the U.S. for example was a really strong argument. The media does make the U.S. look like a rich and powerful country.
Race has always been a difficult topic to discuss. It has not gotten any easier.
It's always crazy to me because I never picked up on it. Whenever anyone new meets my mom they can immediately tell. She was brought up in the South. She spent the majority of her life elsewhere.
I thought it was amazing. A real person is visiting from Afghanistan. He has embraced the western culture.
Living there your whole life, it is very easy to become ignorant of the hate that goes on around you I think.
I believe that people looking different creates a greater sociological divide in American society. I  believe that people looking different causes a greater debate about race.
I mean the foundations of the educational system were laid in Chicago in the late eighteen hundred to produce factory workers due to the social/ economic conditions of that era.
I think nowadays people are too scared to talk about race. They do not want to be viewed as a bad or offensive person by saying the wrong thing. What one person may find offensive another person may not at all.
Perhaps however one of the most important arguments, is that something can never be talked about too much.
What should be brought up is the reason that the protests are happening in the first place.
Another major barrier that causes groups to be less advanced is to be a woman.
I resonated with the students in the video on the far right. I believe they were grouped together. They looked white.
Why it is that Jamaica produces the best runners in the world?
Not only did they initiallyface wars, massacre, slavery, forced displacement,the imposition of treaties,etc. They still remain one of the most underrepresented, unrecognized and discriminatedcommunitieswithin U.S.society.
You would think this diversity would lead to a more accepting youth. It would produce more accepting adults.
I grew up in Northern Jersey. I never necessarily noticed anyone having an accent.
I am sure the nose and eyebrows as discussed in the video will begin to change. More so as more and more ethnic generations begin to blend together.
I find it a little embarrassing that I was unable to distinguish the person from China versus the people from Siberia.
Putting ourselves in each others shoes and understanding the reason behind everyones views and opinions and actions is the only way to truly make progress. At the end of the day, we are all human.
I have always struggled to differentiate Koreans, Chinese, and Japanese people from each other.
I think the alt right people see the external physical differences between white people and other groups/ It leads them to their conclusion that white people have specific genes which make them the best and on top of every other group of people.
I hope that in my lifetime I will be able to see true equality. Unfortunately our world will have this problem into the future.
This is a difficult topic to discuss. The outcomes of these discussions have lead to many riots.
I would not be surprised. In 500 years (if humanity still exists), we will figure out the ins and outs to everything in the universe. We will figure out all of the universe's secrets. We will realize that everything in our universe happened by pure chance
She said that in her experience, Americans can't tell Koreans apart.
Race is considered a really touchy subject. I agree that there needs to be more open communication between races.
Silence holds us back from revolutionizing/ evolving into a better society. The conversation is important.
No one is born racist.
His point of view is just a broader, simpler, wiser/ experienced point of view than any other Ive heard in this kind of topics.
I remember learning that religion/ science can both coexist.
I really like what Sam had to say about this topic.
People forget that Americans are struggling. Even in the wake of hurricane Harvey that devastated Texas.
It honestly also made me feel pretty ignorant.
A major flaw with the media is they influence our perceptions of other countries based on what they report.
I believe that technology is somehow making us more aware and connected. The almost infinite access to information dissolved all of the boundaries that stopped us from learning.
The issue with track. field now comes along. We have to be quite honest.
Race is both an issue on a large and small scale. Whether it be the hate rallies that take place in our very own country. The way we ourselves can judge people in certain situations in our everyday lives.
I believe now thats because of the media.
Some people I know had to go through another program in order to play hockey. Another program most likely costs money.
It makes the most sense that God guided the process of human evolution.
Our lacrosse team was predominantly white with very few players who were black.
People tend to forget. We have extremely poor communities still in this country.
Sam wrapped up this particular video with this quote. Which I think shows the shear absurdity of some of the basic reasons given. Why certain cultural groups excel at certain sports.
Hurricane Irma is currently making landfall.
I immediately thought that I could see how myopic individuals may have been brought to that conclusion. This conclusion was not one of my own.
I think the array of photos showing the people of America is very profound.
Yes there are acts of racial discrimination. They seem very trivial and less aggressive than the ones that take place throughout different parts of the United States.
I have witnessed some racism even within my own family. With my grandparents being extremely racist to black people specifically.
For example if someone was pulled over for speeding or doing something wrong. Said to an officer: did you only pull me over because I am (whatever race)?
Travel the world really resonated with me.
You never truly can understand how others are living. You must see it for yourself.
I really like the quote you pulled from Samuel Richards.
I think that there are a lot of factors that were mentioned in class that have to do with race and sports.
For example, women are paid less in this country.
We should be taught more about the way it has really affected the diverse country we live in. It even does today.
I believe that racism is significantly more relevant in the South.
Rafael Leonidas Trujillo ruled for 30 consecutive years. He is guilty for the murder of thousands of Haitians and Black Dominicans. In his efforts to refine or cleanse the breed.
This racial barrier that we have seen in the past has really been broken. There are marriages between people of nations that would have never happened in the past. The marriages would have been frowned upon.
But this seems to be such an inherently (American?
I liked that the idea of respect to be respected. I think that we must be proud of our difference, proud of our ancestries/ traditions.
I dropped one course my first semester. I dropped another my second semester. I took an F in a core course.
I really couldn't agree with you or Sam more.
I could tell where some of them were from largely by continent. From that I realized that I really do not know a lot about the people that I see every day.
At least I now know that my thoughts were not completely wrong.
Personally, I think we talk about race excessively. It's not in the right context.
From their noses, head shapes, skin color, just as professor Richards said. If you look closer and you know the difference between the areas. Then you will be able to tell where someone is from.
The whites slaughtered millions in Africa. They continuously destabilize regions like the middle east which reduces the chances of innovation and success. People are brought up to a world where all they see is blood and violence.
We have no control over the things of the past. We should start trying to move forward. Work on the things that are in the here and now.
This topic caught my attention for multiple reasons, but the two biggest were the fact that I follow sports religiously. And, because I grew up playing lacrosse and football.
I found your post to be very interesting. I agree with it!
My point of view on this topic is quite similar to what Sam is talking about during this discussion.
Even though we are not the only country having these problems. Being able to speak about it allows those who feel cornered to share how they are feeling.
Im sure its pretty nuanced how all this stuff works. It doesnt make it any less frustrating.
Educating people about why facial structures can be so different is essential. I believe this education could lead to less racial tensions.
Black culture is surrounded by basketball/ football.
We need an educational system that generates awe and curiosity into the students. Not one that kills curiosity and creativity.
I feel like I dont know anything about most countries besides what I hear about in the media. This is such a massive issue today!
The video begins with the topic of why a huge majority of NHL players are white. Next, why a huge portions of NBA players are african american.
There are no reasonable excuses to not learn about anything that makes us passionate nowadays. Especially with the free access of information and available resources in both the digital and physical world.
There are plenty of blacks who are a part of the middle/ higher socioeconomic classes. That has not always been the case in our country.
I agree with your comment that this activity was meant to bring us together.
The biggest difference like you said is within the style of clothes.
I think its invasive. Having someone in your face and see what might appear to them as flaws. They might not look the same as you and may not be familiar with your facial features. If someone is the same race were examining your facial features you may be more comfortable. because we would have more in common and its relatable.
If they are European would they look like an Asian or a European?
The similarity between each picture was amazing. My partner/ I never got one correct.
I can't completely explain it. These race differences exist within lacrosse. I believe. It is linked to culture. and socioeconomic statuses.
Probably one of my biggest step out of your comfort zone experiences I've had in life.
The only thing we can do to truly grasp the concept is to combine studies that have already been done with what is said in the bible.
It is really hurtful to our youth and society. Branch away from the racism. Hate affects our country.
These white supremacists argue that they are superior due to their success and achievements.
My mom grew up in San Antonio TX. She moved out. She was 17.
Sports do not care about the color of one's skin.
Dr. Sam kept stressing about the fact. White supremacists believe that people from other races are not as fully developed. Other races are capable as the whites.
I really liked your story. You said that people are just as happy, if not happier than people in the United States, living in Thailand. Showers are cold, toilets are in the ground and bamboo has to be cut down for cooking fuel.
They tend to like their own people that are similar or identical if they wish to them.
They had motivation and dedication to put themselves to the gym. They worked hard on their bodies.
Walk into the cafeteria during lunch, you would see a table of Asian, a table of Indian, a table of blacks. The rest filled with a sea of white people.
I truly believe that America is on a path to a much more accepting culture. I look forward to the day where instances such as the Charlottesville tragedy, never take place again.
I believe that the more culture you learn from the better understanding you can have. About life. About the world we live in.
Race continues to be brought to attention.
Same was saying something. Afro style hair helps keep the scalp covered from over exposure to the sun. Pale skin means the skin absorbs sun faster than darker skin. This is due to the sun exposure of different places in the world.
I think you make a really good point.
Sam tells us the closer to the equator a person lives, the darker the skin, due to the amount of direct sunlight that a person will be exposed to.
Race needs to be a more common-place topic. People on both sides can be more open. They can be more accepting about race.
I did not know that the external differences between humans is a fairly recent shift. I found that very fascinating.
Skin color. Determine who people are.
We touched upon this in class. Mostly white men play hockey.
During Sams discussion, he mentioned something. He said some sports have only recently become available in all areas of the world. One example sport is ice hockey.
I found the international students to be much more soft spoken. They dressed much differently than the American students. Almost neater and well kept.
To me, that sounds like a really positive and productive way to get past a problem that was plaguing a country.
This is what never allows all groups of a race to come to an accepting and understanding state.
The voice tells you so many things about a person. Where they are from, where they have spent lengthy periods of time, their general age. Sometimes the social class that they belong to.
Every one of us is an illustration of the past. It's a beautiful thing to think about.
Still though, I worry about all the conflict that can cause from this sort of mindset that a lot of communities seem to exhibit.
One of the big ways racism is discussed is in the news. Racism is discussed on social media.
It is truly fascinating to think about the future. The majority of people will be of all different kinds of backgrounds.
Rather, it is upon the individual It is upon how hard the individual trains, how many hours they put in the gym.
You assume they are all white. As you look closely you will find these distinctive features. There are details that are different compared to your people.
A lot of the players in the NBA did not come from the best parts of the country or even world.
I agree with most of what Matthew said in his post.
After a long day of grueling work, they come home to their families. The children go to school. Some may even go to college.
Almost every day that you check the media there is some type of headline involving a cop abusing their power. There's a very high chance that it was involving an African American.
Last week at work I heard a little boy say something. A little girl. It made me think.
Just the fact that people from other countries feel it's necessary to come up with a more American name. Shows that we don't really appreciate how hard it is to come to America.
I love hockey. I got excited seeing the players on the screen. I was ready for a good discussion.
Maybe the entity created the many universes. They could have collided to form our universe. This is a current theory.
It's sad to think that my grandparents grew up thinking that white people are much superior than any other race or religious type.
This means that being called uneducated goes from being an insult to a sad reality.
Granted, a lot of the African community here at PSU has been very friendly and open to me. I know its not the same everywhere in the United States.
Sam said it. I think religion is great. It's a necessary part of most people's lives.
He is a great example of what real people are like.
Before this lecture, I also did not know that peoples different features were culturally adapted over time.
I can also attest to your observation of people dating people who resemble their family or even themselves. I have seen this first hand many times.
I think people fail to realize Latin America is just a big cluster of diverse looking people.
I can't say that I have never experienced racism in my life.
Thinking about the amount of children that go to bed hungry every night in America, it doesn't seem like something that would actually happen. We just have to see the world in a different light.
The same cruel intention to cleanse the race that enslaved our society for years. Is still one that simply hasn't gone away.
The Matching Ancestor activity reminded me of a discussion I had with one of my friends in high school.
We talk about race too much. There are no true leaders per se of the races.
There are no terms to necessarily be negotiated. Under the law in the United States all U.S. citizens are equal.
Finally, I love what you said about the Americanized names international students use.
That can eliminate the argument. Black people have better hops. White guys are better adapted to play in the cold.
Therefore, every race is equally evolved.
These are generalizations. Black culture and white culture are different.
It requires all sorts of equipment. It isn't always accessible at public schools.
I pointed her out immediately. Brittany  was surprised.
I always thought that made us such an interesting group to look at.
Women dont get enough opportunity to be advanced.
In other words, everything points to the fact that humans are all going to evolve differently. Depending on their environment.
Slavery was abolished, and the Civil War led to the recognition of African American citizenship and voting rights (with some exceptions).
The video and topic I chose to respond to was regarding race. They discussed whether or not we talk about it too much.
I would have never thought of it that way. Professor Richards didn't phrasedit like that.
By contrast, I felt like school was actually killing my curiosity.
I believe the more we speak up the better it is.
I couldn't agree more about your input about that video.
In addition, the weather plays a big role in this also. It needs to be in cold temperatures to play the game. Otherwise you will not have ice to skate on.
Hockey is one of the most expensive sports to play due to all of the equipment.
This would help in basketball. This sport requires running and passing.
This notion that genes are the only reason why certain races of people are good at a sport is false.
He does this to show that white people are the most advanced. They they have the most privilege.
I think if everyone had a clean slate and kept an open mind we would all be able to understand each other. Without have to be scared to talk about it.
I always just thought that race relations were a universal problem on the same level it is here in America. Listening to all the peoples different thoughts from there different backgrounds it became apparent. Race is an issue everywhere yet it does seem to be much more of an issue in America.
Other countries have race problems as well. I think ours has been pushed to the main stage of news outlets. Our country has become a priority in many people's lives. A voice has been given to those oppressed such as the civil rights movement and the black lives matter movement.
Ideally, everyone should be equal in all aspects of life. Until that is reality, some issues need to be dealt with differently because of race.
Other than this problem, I only see the benefits. Good can come out of using social media in class.
I think race needs to be talked about.
You said being racist is not something we are born with. It is something we learn over time.
I saw a video recently, where someone asked different pairs of kids to find a difference between themselves.
We don't have to ignore what is happening. By ignoring this kind of problem you're not going anywhere.
I agree that one ethnicity of people is not more evolved/ better than others.
There is so much frustration with these law enforcement cases. The United States government has never acknowledged it. They haven't punished the cops who abused their popwer.
Not talking about the issue is not going to solve it.
I had the choice to pick between the two I chose basketball. It is so much easier to get ready to play.
I completely agree with your post. All individuals of any race should have the freedom to play any sport.
It's incredible how society has advanced through the years. We haven't been able to solve all these racism problems.
The Evolution Theory is a really tough concept to get your head around. No one is 100% sure what happened.
As I got older, I noticed a difference in the sports. I would play compared to my black friends.
I don't think Jeffton had any idea they were actually Latino. He just happen to get lucky.
It is important for us as a society to stop segregating ourselves. We may never understand the views of people who are not like us. Unless we do
Canada and Russia are places that are typically cold and icy. Whites adapt better to in the cold and blacks do not work well in the cold. We need to live closer to the equator in order to support our melanin.
Compare his body to the average white man, He most likely has quite a few inches over them being 6 feet and 5 inches.
I agree exactly with what you said.
Theistic Revolution is what the majority of people believe in. One cannot say that it is the correct form of evolution.
I think understanding the idea of mixed is the greatest objective.
However, I believe that every race evolved the same.
I guess that can be attributed to a sense of pride, also.
As far as your question about if Sam's comments are crossing the racism line - I don't think he crosses it.
With the collective minorities set to pass whites population wise in early 2040 I think you will see America shift into a more equal society everyday.
The question of accents was brought up in class. I was immediately intrigue
This activity really opened my eyes. It seems to have done the same in your case.
Lieutenant Colonel Garey talked about what shocked him the most about Afghanistan. It was really cool. He shared the same interpretations of the country that I had.
India was fighting between two main large groups of people.
I agree with you with your take on what happened in the Hayden situation.
Its important to recognize these individuals. They shatter all of the explanations we think we have.
I'd like to quote a DJ i like.
Racism is socially present. People put too much of an emphasis on so called differences. In reality, the only difference between people of different races is skin color.
I feel that Sam really wanted to express this by specifically choosing people of mixed backgrounds. He also further expand on it by including some students who were still of only one background.
I think that when people make these bold generalizations its just the fact that they may have a lack of knowledge. It's a result of where they are from and raised. It's something that people should be taught not to do until they spend time learning other cultures and doing their research.
I didnt understand that they have some similar issue we go through.
People who are white supremacists have been taught to see a very specific way.
I do think that sports is a very cultural idea. That's why we see the difference in color in the two sports.
I come from a similar situation. I am fully Indian.
I would dare to say that that schools/ universities need a reformation at the core of its system.
Professor Richards said that its very important that we note the differences in people from different countries. People from different countries may be the same race.
Traveling to foreign countries opens your eyes to many things.
even though theres more to it, I just do not know enough about Africa and all of the countries in it to ask more in depth questions.
I found that to be really interesting.
It is perplexing to even think bout what goes on in the minds of theseAlt-Right people.
Take slavery for example, for me I feel as if the US has not taken responsibility for their actions. Instead has looked at slavery as being a dark part of our history that we should forget and move on from.
We group others on the way they look when in reality they have may have little to no relation at all.
I may have not noticed due to my being white. I never really thought about that picture in terms of race. It portrays that white people are superior to colored people.
A southern accent can sometimes be mistaken for ignorance. It really is just a reflection of the immigrants who first came to the United States.
Sam was saying in class, all humans are 99.7% the same. These alt-right beliefs are active in today's society.
I believed it was sociology.
If generations ago a group of Asians moved over to Europe then their descendants lived in Europe for hundreds of years would they be Asians or Europeans?
Other than that I do believe it is completely cultural.
Sam discussed the two volunteers physical appearance in the video. I can't help but to think of how amazing it is that the traits we carry around today, are the same traits of our ancestors.
Hockey is a very expensive sport to play.
We were having snack and she threw away a perfectly good yogurt. She didn't want it all, all she did was open and smell it.
No matter what your skin color is, some people are cruel. Some people do terrible things.
Overall I thought the exercise was pretty eye opening for everyone in the class.
Spreading hatred about one race or other causes riots to break out.
Some will argue that it is a human nature to conclude that their own people are better than some. They feel more comfortable among who are alike to them.
I found this to be an extremely interesting topic!
When I told the person next to me I was actually Latina, he responded, wow, but you don't look latino. A response I get often.
I agree with you. Race is talked about too much in a negative light.
We need to embrace the fact we are the same. We need to stop the racism. We need to stop the thought of one race being better than the rest.
People try to guess what I am. Nine times out of ten they are wrong. They are usually way off.
Sam then went into a rather confusing talk about the Siberians coming over to America. How the Native Americans and Siberians look so similar.
The important thing is for all of us to keep an open mind to the many possibilities that the world has to offer.
This is a huge problem. The media has such a big influence on people.
Silence means people are afraid to talk about whats bothering them.
Every evolution theory makes sense in its own ways. One person cannot claim one is right and the other is wrong, If one claims that there is only one correct evolution theory then they are ignorant.
Shorter torso/ longer legs allow people to run faster.
I do think we are on a positive path.
It is insane to think about not even knowing how many native american tribes are present in the US. How that information is never presented to us in high school.
I feel as though our society today finds it easier to consider sports inherently racist simply because they don't go deeper into what is actually racist about it.
The vast majority of people in power in Panama are white. Most of the people doing low class jobs are brown people.
There are many different religious/ ethnic groups in India. People there tend to look the same brown.
I agree with the video. The United States has never come to terms with the fact that this country was built on racism.
I think that problem can be solved relatively easily just by our fellow classmates showing respect to each other.
Overall, I think its important to remember. Many white individuals who excel at football/ basketball.
There are the only two obvious explanations to me. The sport can be played in all areas of the world. People of all races are able to train their bodies to play the sport.
I think racism is something you are taught from a young age.
I feel as though this lecture was interesting. It truly opened my eyes on how we view the way people look. How we initially categorize them.
Basketball is a much cheaper sport to play.
That is evident in today's society. There are different hate groups spawning throughout the world.
One of the biggest factors of that goes hand in hand with sports is economic status.
Anybody of any race should be able to play any sport without it being considered unordinary.
Topics such as the criminal justice system that on the surface don't seem to involve race sometimes affect minority groups. It is different than how they affect white people.
Only 67% of Native students become high school graduates. This is well below the national average.
They excelled at different sports based on where their physical/ evolutionary strengths exceeded.
I have seen that photo of evolution many times. I never thought about the fact that the person in front is a white guy.
These traits can be seen in athletes of all races. That is why I believe lacrosse will diversify.
I really like how Sam explained it in class. How they consider themselves to be a superior race. How they truly believe that other races are incapable and underdeveloped.
We were getting to know each other. We went to the mall. We met up with her sister. She was there with several other Korean international students.
There is an answer for both statements. If we are either talking too much about or not talking about the subject at all.
I do not personally know if it is the same in other Latin American countries but it probably is.
Poverty doesn't mean everything.
America has made some efforts to right the wrongs of our past. These efforts haven't been good enough.
The video was mostly about perspective that we have of certain places in this world.
It always seemed like everyone got along. The color of your skin didn't matter. The religion you practiced didn't matter.
I cannot deny that there are sports like Hockey/ Basketball/ Lacrosse that have a higher majority of one race than other sports.
We must talk about it. We must seek solutions. We are bound to repeat our past. Race will continue to be big issue.
A point in the video I would like to discuss was when the war on drugs was brought up.
I believe that sports is not racist. People have made the idea that ancestry and genetics play the biggest role.
I still had plenty of friends of other races. I wonder why people of different races almost segregate themselves into groups.
Lacrosse is similar to hockey. It is predominantly played by white guys. I believe this is due to cultural differences.
They work really hard to show you hospitality where you dont expect it.
If you look at the images that come from the Hubble telescope due to technological advancements. You get a sense of awe and transcendence that changes the way you think.
I really thought the girl whose parents met in State college is incredible.
Where do the other races play into that evolution?
I feel like you'll always be able to tell for the most part that someone is like, Asian or of African decent. You can't always say the same for Latinos.
I remembered feeling so angry about it because it obviously was.
For them to learn about the differences in African Americans we would have to point them out.
I agree with Kiley about how people from different economic, political, and racial backgrounds all have the same thing in common. They want to try to make their group seem better.
I think there are other indirect/ subtler issues that should involve in race discussions.
Sure it has taken like three or four lectures to get it done. I think most of the people in the lecture are already influenced about what Professor Richards has said.
If you take hockey for example, the majority of NHL players are white. There is no secret that the best hockey players come from places like Canada or Russia.
We are all human beings. Who is this group of people to dehumanize others/ make them feel lesser than.
Hiding behind an online keyboard is very simple. Debating inflammatory points of view could be challenging. With the implementation of social media we can hopefully generate an atmosphere of learning about all different points of view. We can maintain civility whether we agree or disagree on any issue
On the other side, african americans are more likely to gravitate towards playing basketball. That was something you could play anywhere at any time of the year.
Why is it that the NHL is dominated by people with white skin?
My hometown is a predominately white town. Drug use has always been an issue there.
In the United States, hate crimes are very common. Police brutality is a very recurrent (but also avoided) topic.
These issues/ problems come from speakers who place one race on top of another race.
Personally, I really do not understand. Racism is such a huge problem in the United States.
Whenever I think of the world poor, starving or something along those lines. My mind automatically goesto Africa. Or somewhere in the middle east. Where there are many children who are starving.
I do not think though that people should feel guilty for the things that their ancestors did.
Throughout school, we have always been taught about slavery. We truly never addressed the issue at hand.
Hockey is one of the most expensive sports to play growing up.
In the previous discussion group, this issue came up. One of the students said that we should ignore race as we all equal and interact with each other. Based on the conduct and manners we have.
If this remains the case it will be hard for lower socioeconomic groups to play the sport.
Meeting people who are different from us is essential. It makes the world a more knowledgeable and inclusive place.
Some of us might look at a homeless black man. We might think well, he brought this on himself.
I think a lot of black children are denied the opportunity to play hockey. All you need to play basketball is a ball. You need a hoop nailed to a post too.
In a song he says, before revolution can start in the streets, it first has to happen in the mind.
Whenever I meet someone from Africa, I just say thats cool!
We must raise our children and future generation to avoid noticing a difference between Skylar and the other two lovely women.
As a personal example, I know that things are kind of strained between American blacks and Africans. Due to lack of knowledge on Africa in this country from Americans. Overall a lot of misunderstandings between the two groups.
I would like to know. Are there any instances of racism in India today?
So far this class has taught me that our physical traits is a special story of our ancestry, one that should be cherished.
I agree. The statements you have made in your response.
No matter your political beliefs. I believe there was no justification in electing someone. Who could potentially hurt people you care about with their decisions.
School shootings, and church shootings are also unheard of in Puerto Rico. Hearing about all these different hate acts shocked me tremendously.
I think it is not talked about enough. This class should be a class in every high school.
You make a good point about our country coming together.
How else could it be explained. The majority of basketball players, short distance runners, high jumpers, and football players are black.
You said your dad loves football. You grew up watching the New York Giants. You're going to have a strong love for the game. Strive to play football.
Unfortunately, if someone were to live in a poor area. They wouldn't be able to have the access to all the equipment. And extra money that goes into hockey.
Still this I see this applied in society today. People are always guessing someone's nationality. While sometimes they guess correctly, many times the answer could be shocking.
Looking back at the lecture, I was just as astonished about the fully developed human being. How that in almost all figures the standing straight up human was white.
I do not agree. Race should not be put in the same category as religion Race should not be put in the same category as politics.
Personally, I do not think sports are inherently racist.
It does almost seem like our society has caused it to be disrespectful to talk about someones race or ethnicity. In fact we should be learning about it more, as Sam stated.
This not only tears a nation apart. It restricts it from progressing.
Before coming here, I never really saw myself (primarily) as a minority. Whenever I met people, I would never immediately think about their skin color. How that plays a major role for them in society.
This is the same thing that happened with basketball.
The players that come out of the USA are predominately from colder states that are up north. These include New York, Minnesota, Michigan/ Boston.
Most players in the NHL today are from either foreign countries, Canada or the United States.
A key explanation for high level athleticism prevalently found in black people is an acclimation of their black ancestors used to adapt to their geographic location.
The examples he uses are phenomenal. I really enjoyed this topic in particular.
Education is absolutely the first step to get away from ignorance It is way too prevalent in the United States.
Yes, alt right people do have a very strong opinion. They can be narrow minded in the ways they think about human evolution. They surely do exist.
I think the majority of the US people don't really travel and their view is just stuck in one place. They have a negative views about a country. And don't really want to learn about other countries in general.
I believe and agree with the Every Life Matters Movement.
I dont believe that the typical buildup of some races is superior to other races.
He said its like people from Peru have something in common with us in Pennsylvania.
It is easy spot differences between yourself and other people without giving it another second to ask yourself why.
I am speaking on personal experience here however.
I find that most millennials are very open to all races. They don't discriminate either There obviously are certain oddballs out there that share different views.
and even amongst blacks along those categories (whose the blackest, who isnt, whatever) and its so frustrating. because there are a lot of things that we are dealing with at the same time. and it feels pointless to try to make us feel better than other people in our own communities..
It is true that many people tend to stay in on place in their whole life. They never explore different thing outside their community.
Never would I have thought would there ever be any discrimination present in my community.
Whereas that is not the case, if we travel the world. Broaden our perspective. We wouldn't be caught up of just believing what we are given by the media.
The sport will begin to become a part of many cultures. I believe it will stay within higher socioeconomic status groups because of the cost of equipment and other costs associated with the sport.
I am not sure. Can an action like that can help out the problem in America?
However, whichever race was put at the end of the spectrum still would have gotten scrutiny. The original picture got scrutiny.
I think we need to talk about race in better places than the current status quo is.
Recently in America, the actions of the racists in Charlottesville have made it seem like our country has taken a few steps backward. Even if  that is not the case.
Growing up in Ethiopia/ speaking three languages helped me see the world differently. It is not a one sided view.
He is openly talking about these things. Some people aren't used to hearing it.
Everything Sam said made complete sense.
Our views of the world around us are formed based on others perspectives.
Just because it's all we see in the news doesn't mean you have to ignore it.
I appreciated the theories that were presented however.
When they asked about the point of this activity, I said something. I think it was to show that people aren't that different.
I was surprised. I guessed incorrectly. I realized that it was just straight up hard to differentiate.
As I got older, I began to learn more about evolution and the differences between what God says about creation compared to what science says. My views started to shift more towards believing in Theistic Revolution.
Today, it is safe to say that white privilege is alive and well. We have a president who scored a victory not by popular vote, but thanks to the electoral system. It was (and is still) rooted on those inequality precepts.
However, the idea of Accepting and Understanding one another will never be achieved in my opinion.
For instance, Dominicans experienced one of the most brutal dictatorships the American continent has ever seen.
For the most part, the media focuses on negative problems that are happening all around the world.
I think that in specific aspects of life in America, certain races are not treated equal.
Their skin color has evolved. Their skin color helps them survive in their location.
In the end, the student was surprisingly pretty successful at grouping the students together. One detail that really either helped him or killed him. Many of the students chosen to be examples had mixed ancestries.
It is very easy to see an entire race in the same light. It is extremely unfair at the same time.
This act is not exclusive to the U.S. It keeps happening in everyplace around the world.
Hateful comments can come out of it. That is exactly what we see all the time.
There may not be racism. I do find. There is segregation.
I thought I would never assume that someones misfortunes or skills were a result of race and their own biological make up!
Looking at the different pictures of people who looked very similar, it was clear that everyone in the class had different opinions on where each person was from.
There is nothing wrong with being prideful in ones beliefs. Promoting ones beliefs can be done in a better manner.
My dad always says that every person you meet came from an long unbroken line of survivors. All of our ancestors were able to overcome every natural and man made disaster that the world has gone through. From the Ice Age to the Black Plague, since the beginning of time.
That really opened my eyes to the fact that even though we always place people under certain labels in our minds. They aren't always correct.
I agree with Sam. People make such bold statements. The separation between white people and other people is so distinct. It shows their ignorance and lack of knowledge about our DNA.
You could have given it to me. There are children starving in Africa!
Sam brought this up in class. I was taken aback a bit. I never really thought about third-world countries in that light.
In college, the story was sort of similar. A big percentage of my classes and professors were uninspiring. They generated a banal environment for learning.
Shawn, The video you picked is definitely one with a lot of controversy around it.
Due to this, people like athletes resort to their own ways to protest and talk about race.
They show images of malls. The malls were bombed. They make it seem like a very poor country.
I hope that maybe Sam could elaborate on what I am trying to say in class someday.
This is striking. We all may look different. We are created the same way, our bones, vessels, DNA.
I became friends with Brittany. She came to the U.S. from South Korea to do high school/ college.
I definitely agree. White people believe. Whites had power over all the other races.
Most african Americans will be seen to live in southern, warmer states. Such as Florida, Georgia, and Louisiana where basketball and football are played more often.
One group constantly being controlled/ harassed by another proves the point that we do not speak about it enough.
In order to truly immerse your self in different cultures, travel is key.
I do not think it makes much sense to say that white people have better genes than any other group. All humans are genetically almost the same.
They can't prove they are more evolved than any other group of people.
In conclusion, I believe the reason more white people play hockey and more african americans play basketball. Is because of differences in cultural locations with slight economic reasons.
I also played many sports growing up.
I believe that it does have to do with finances.
I truly feel. This is very unjust. This is racist of our country/president.
I remember from one of the classes this semester Sam said something like we are 99.9 precent the same, DNA wise.
The boy said sarcastically, "Why did you throw it out?"
Its really cool to see how different parts of the country have their own colloquial slang.
I completely understand that race does need to be discussed to bring to light the racial injustices that go on in the country. If racism wasn't such a huge issue in our country we would not have to discuss it.
We live in a completely different world. People's careers are self determined. Access to information is available everywhere instantaneously.
I thought the explanation that Sam provided to explain the subtlest differences in eye structure was very interesting.
Do people actually think having white skin means they reached a further, more advanced level of evolution?
Going to these little villages/ seeing the poverty was horrible. We went to the king's palace. It was twice the size of the white house.
Much of our coverage of race relations is done by major news networks. They are normally very biased.
I studied my ass off freshman year in these engineering classes. It wasn't yielding any results that reflected it.
This becomes a learning experience. It forces you to reflect on what you have/ dont have where you live.
Being conservative/ being a racist are two very different things.
They love the sport. People who live there excel at it.
Both our parents are mostly accepting of it. That is the feeling I get. I met her parents just this weekend actually.
Their total disregard of facts like that we are 99.9% the same is baffling. It proves that they are a group of ignorant individuals.
Come elections, I watched my county go red.
I love listening to people talk. I love different dialects and languages. You just get a little glimpse into who they really are without even really talking to them
All human beings have the ability to be athletic, extremely fit, strong, focused, etc.
In this specific video we had one student. Group others by appearance. Using only his own judgement.
That truly went to show how people from all over the world could have similar looks.
Sometimes I find myself doing that as well.
He started to say how Siberia was part of Russia. You could argue that all those people are European because theyre Russian.
The problem with race, in my opinion, is that it is not spoken enough about.
At first we thought the sun revolved around the earth.
The American-Korean and Korean activity was very intriguing to me. I do not think I would have been able to identify them by their background.
I now see. We live in a bubble.
Over time, I felt like I was stuck in the same dull learning routine.
We do not live in a perfect world. Everyone is bound to disagree.
The media wants to control your interpretations. The media shows only the bad things about Afghanistan.
Socioeconomic status is a huge factor. It determines where athletes end up at the professional level.
Some can argue that it is a primal instinct to fight over dominance.
Because of these reasons, I do not think talking about race relations is beneficial in the least.
She spent most of her time traveling. She ended up settling down in NYC. She has a ton of southern mannerisms.
The people that govern Panama are white Christians with high economic status that end up leading with their interests first. The people's interest comes second.
I believe that it can be seen as a geographical idea.
Talk about it. Don't make it uncomfortable.
I also agree People are looking to date in other races. It's exotic is not right.
Let me start with a little background.
I got into hockey only 4 years ago. I never watched a game prior to that.
Before coming to the US I grew up in Ethiopia. Before coming to the US I attended a french school.
Though many individuals may disagree with this all you have to do is look at this countrys history. Other minorities have been constantly scrutinized and dehumanized. In order to make a white man life better.
Most media has spoken about how kneeling is insulting to the military. It is distracting from the NFL.
Aside from evidence like that, I think that sports are inherently not racist.
I agree that race should be most talked about in instances focused on race, like hate crimes.
I have always been interested in studying faces.
Professor Richards claims that in the future physical features that distinguish people of different heritage will fuse together. People will look much more similar to each other.
Why do we always see Jamaicans winning the Olympics 100m dashes?
It makes me wonder. What the human race will look like in the future?
The Alt Right group tries to make white people look the most advanced. They are the most evolved.
I agree with everything you said.
As a society, we tend to focus a lot on race and stop there. Everyone has a unique geographical history. That displays itself through physical appearance as well as languages and accents.
Some fear the thought of change. They will do anything at all costs to preserve their way of life.
Overall, I enjoyed your response. I understand where you're coming from in all of your points.
I played a multitude of sports throughout high school. I still compete at the IM and Club levels here.
We need to learn how to educate our country's youth. The country will never be able to move forward as one.
Now that these sports are more accessible, no matter what culture you are, or climate you live in. It is gradually starting to become more and more common. For there to be a white NBA player or black NHL player.
Matthew, I could not agree more.
Sam at one point draws attention to the fact that many jump to the conclusion that America is the best country.
I do not really understand how they can think that white culture and white people are the most evolved. Biologically we are 99.9% the same.
Personally, I would love to learn how to find key attributes of the different people around the world to correctly. At least try to group them together.
Although this sounds narrow minded of me, I just truly do not understand why people believe that they are better than others based off of their race or religion.
Due to the growing population of blacks in these groups, I believe more blacks will be seen playing lacrosse.
As opposed to popular belief, this continent was not discovered by the Europeans. It was looted and raped until most of its native population was wiped out.
I also found it so interesting as to how each student in the line dressed, talked, and even acted differently. Once they were all asked questions individually.
Sam tells us the point blank truth. Many people aren't used to hearing it. Since these tough topics are usually avoided and are left undiscussed.
Some people were rejected based on their religion and origin. they wanted to fit with others. they denied their own county and principles to please some folks.
I am a white individual. It is hard to believe that some people actually believe the alt right theories.
I think that media companies have actually hurt race relations. It is more profitable to drive up a problem. I think that media companies make it worse. It is not profitable to genuinely help race relations.
No matter how much we study evolution, we will never be able to figure out how/ why we were created. That does not mean people cant have their own beliefs/ theories.
I studied aboard last semester. I traveled to 12 different countries throughout Asia, Africa/ Europe.
What does it mean to look Latino?
We take in what the media portrays. We don't think twice about how that could be completely wrong.
Race is just not something I am used to talking about openly in our society.
I hope that the Asian students didn't feel uncomfortable when the activity started. It is an obvious difference that these nationalities have from Americans.
In the United States specifically, race is a highly tense topic because of the current events that have been happening revolving around it.
In poorer, mostly black neighborhoods, kids grow up playing basketball with their friends down the street from their house.
To enact change, race needs to actually be spoken about in a clear/ open way.
Five minutes prior I had just preached sociology over biology.
It is a matter of training ones body. Training is to run faster and faster.
I think its informative. Not all people are cultured.
Dropping them is easier said than done. Dropping them will allow each race to place these issues behind them.
In the example from class, determining where different black people were from, it was interesting to see the differences.
Just tell me you disapprove of me dating someone who doesn't treat me right.
The first time I noticed myself stopping to reconsider my belief was during the biology vs. sociology lecture.
Your point about how different places around the globe have different climates. Which influence how people in that area look is something I can agree with.
Those values can either be positive or negative.
By not traveling, you wont see that the people half way across the world are just like us.
Without these external differences, we would not be here today. Those differences are what led generations. To keep passing on their genes.
Most of us are aware of the fact that certain groups of people do have an advantage in this society, whether we like it or not.
If any other student was up there attempting what he did we all would have make mistakes in our selected groups.
In a school like Penn State its very easy to put into practice what we discussed in this lecture. There are people from everywhere.
When the student had to choose and group the students together. He matches the facial appearances that were significant of their ethnic background. And paired it with others who shared the same similarities.
Obviously, I cannot deny the history behind many of the sports.
Being really proud of whom you are and letting all else know that they are best.
The personal agenda in this case is the homophobia that occurs in American society. Christians make a claim against gay rights citing their faith.
Political leaders were united. Political leaders were showing the people that it is ok to join together. It is okay to vote for a common good.
What is the point of taking away a woman's rights? You aren't even going to give the man 100% of what he asked for.
Soldiers learn through these processes of how to interact and communicate with people of different culture.
I wonder if the Afghan children are raised feeling the same way about America.
Even if I was religious,I would not want to force other people to follow the guidelines of my personal religion.
I never thought that there were jobs in the military where you are not constantly fearing for your life or having to dodge a bullet.
Hearing from Rafi truly put things into perspective for me.
It is a difficult task. The book itself is relatively short.
The Constitution has adapted with time.
Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, etc, all were southern states. They created these laws based on their Christian beliefs. Those are unfair considering our country was based on equal rights for everyone.
Then, who could forget Moas invasion of Tibet? Most of the entire country was completely destroyed.
My eyes were definitely opened. Many people tend to have tunnel vision when they are forming their opinions with religious reasonings.
They took control of whole nations like India. They enslaved their people in a way.
It's discussions like these that really make you put yourself into someone else's shoes. You appreciate the life you live.
It's shocking. I see the pervasiveness of political figures and pundits. They push for Christian theocracy in the main stream media.
LTC Garey opened my eyes to the life of a soldier. He explained what really goes on. He explained the interactions between the two militaries.
I only go to mass every Sunday. I'm home from school.
A challenge lies in interpreting the Bible and Quran.
I think the problem is interpretation.
You can see some people who interpret the bible. They ustify their hate for gay people, They were seen in class.
The soldier also entered Afghanistan with the same hesitant perspective. It caused him to be distrustful of the local people.
However, I cannot imagine how life is for people who are learning religion in their school too. I believe the two do not mix at all.
It's creating more controversy.
We came in. We changed their way of life for their goods.
We need to understand. They consider themselves to be apart of the religion.
After this class I still believe the war is pointless for the most part. However, my reasoning for why it is pointless has changed.
The only thing that people talk about is that how that country has been a conflict zone. They do not really discuss the status of the innocent Afghan people.
I have always associated Sharia law with Afghanistan. That is not the case.
People make their own decisions on what is right and wrong. They find parts of the Bible that support their beliefs. They use religion as their backbone.
I personally had never really taken the time to think about it. War affects innocent people. They are just trying to get through life.
Especially coming from the east coast, known for our slight hostile nature, I have never associated generosity and friendliness as part of our community identity.
Humans choose what they believe in. It is based on what they think is morally right.
Any person can pick and choose. They follow their faith.
Are you referring to his opinions beforehand? I think your statement is valid.
The political officials that were there were even encouraging women to vote.
After all, they are both books. They guide someone to the path of some sort of righteousness or fulfillment.
America has hundreds of different religions. We will never operate under a singular religious Sharia law.
Fortunately, he answered that question. Another student had asked it.
I think people often ignore an important fact. Christianity was forcibly spread.
Rafi definitely opened my eyes more. I see how very similar our culture and beliefs can be.
The sensitivity and the gravity would definitely be more drastic.
Those do not practice religion everyday. They wouldn't call themselves a devout Christian. They announce a faith in God. They adhere to American political traditions. seems to be an unquestionably essential step in the campaign process.
Many see countries in the Middle East as poverty-stricken wastelands. They have nothing to tell them otherwise.
He talked about communities coming together to develop a plan for a government. They planned how to curb the Taliban.
Ssomeone in our class had their home bombed. The bombing shows how close this problem is to us.
Wars are a tragic and horrifying place to be. These men and women pull through it together for their fellow soldiers. They've grown to love them. They fight for their country every day.
And to your point of the number of different authors of the Bible is something else to consider.
Holding racist, sexist, etc views are terrible. as long as you keep that view to yourself and let people live their lives, life will continue.
I think the bible's rules are overly strict.
Not all of them are our enemies. Many have nothing to do with fighting. They just live there.
I was disgusted. I learned about the Catholic church's history with pedophilia and sexual assault.
It's as previously stated. The Bible and the Quran are more similar than they are different. Why is it that there are so many differences between Muslims and Christians?
I feel like in part thats also do to the fact that after 9/11 America began to instill fear in their people of people from the middle east such as Muslims.
I agree with everything that you just said.
I feel like the combination of religion and state is what ultimately crippled many countries in the Middle East.
This is especially since it is a war that Americans were a part of.
Can we say that someone really is not a Muslim or a Christian because of how they interpret the Quran or the Bible?
He was such a good man. He was educated, well spoken, courageous. Above all, he had a heart of gold.
People need to see more about the similarities among people instead of the difference.
Many people think this is discrimination.
I know a person who didn't even know there were shopping centers in Morocco.
This backlash goes to show. There should be this separation between the religion sector and the schools.
Sam revealed his 1 percent African ancestry. I really wished everyone with racist views heard that loud and clear.
Too short too easily use as a reference for the ever changing social landscape.
I cannot believe that I actually thought soldiers spend most of their time fighting.. Soldiers being in contact with the enemy.
It depends on what a person's intentions were when reading that verse.
This is how evil comes to power.
Without being able to know about all the religions and cultural differences around the world, I believe many people will get stuck in that one-sided mindset. They blindly judge others without much knowledge.
There was support for a before school Bible study. It occurred every Wednesday.
It's odd to me that such could even exist.
Sharia Law is using this book as a baseline. This book shows how to structure the laws and ideals of the land.
His stories put a face and life behind the idea of people living in a place experiencing war.
I've thought this way because of my own experiences growing up. I could easily see how someone could do the same with the Quran.
I think having the Establishment Clause is vital for any country to thrive.
How are they justifying it with the Bible?
Religion has always been used to justify oppression of minorities.
That is a truly scary number of innocent people losing their lives.
He does a great job talking about specific interactions he had with all sorts of Afghani people. They live lives just like us.
The current state of Mosul like the one Skype speaker was talking about makes it so important to understand why this issue is important to address.
I definitely feel like I take it for granted. I have life and opportunity here in America.
At their core, they are a set of principles to live your life by.
Would that person be saved by God? Are they not considered a Christian based on their practices?
There is a call for a religious nation. it is shocking that no one has called for our schools to be Christianized.
Sam mentioned how ridiculous it is to interpret and implement ancient laws into our modern society.
In terms of this criteria, many people (including those who criticize homosexuality) are technically going to hell too. According to the teachings they believe so deeply in.
The Lord's Resistance Army is an African group. It goes around killing Muslims that do not want to convert to Christianity.
I can appreciate this point of view. I contend there would've been a better way to go about it.
I've always thought that by default, I could imagine what it would be like. Someone is living in a war torn area like Rafi and Bassim.
Anyways, Im wondering. About the comparison.
Racism is going on. People claim to be very religious.
Speaking with Rafi threw me for a loop.
However, the Quran cannot solve all problems people face in their every-day life.
It also turns out that Afghani people don't all fervently hate Americans and our way of life.
It was terrifying to think about. I didn't want to imagine someone I loved in such a hostile place.
The fact that Sam thought switching the roles would make those people understand why our government is messed up is just sad.
It is just like you said. This conflict is rooted in the idea of religious superiority.
This was an interesting perspective. I had not considered it yet.
Sam showed pictures. They were all images of Black families thriving in society.
My uncle has been deployed twice thus far. Each time I dismissed the reality. It was such an ungraspable concept. He was going to war.
Their voting is unlike that of the United States. The people still have to worry about their safety when they're voting. This often deters them from even coming. In the United States, it's simple. and we just have to fill out a form.
Training, discipline, and strength is hardcore in the military. People still have a bad stigma about soldiers.
I certainly didn't view Afghanistan as being quite similar to the US. We regard its living conditions or its suburbs.
This part of the lecture is where I really began to think. I gained more perspective of what an average Muslim believes.
ISIS is far from what the Quran teaches.
I wonder if they think that we are terrible people. We want to be in war. We are killing their family members for no reason.
There are several divisions when we look at the Islamic world.
It is very hard to even begin to imagine living in a constant state of worry and fear.
I think he should do this more often. His comparisons of Christianity to Islam.
By killing the bad guys, some of our people will also lose their lives.
If they were truly devout in their following of their religion, they would know they were in the wrong for causing such suffering, pain, and loss.
As the leader of our country, he should not put those who were standing up for equality on the same moral level as those who believe the complete opposite.
AN example is the case of the Uganda genocide of the 90s. The nation did not have control of its own people.
I love how Rafi says that he knows peace always wins over war. That is what drives him to keep fighting until that is achieved.
I have always referred to these people, the people who mistreat others and justify it with the Bible, fake Christians.
I believe that the groups of people who created the Bible and Quran did it to be able to control large masses of people under fear.
They are losing loved ones too. They have been in war for way too long.
It brought the idea of war to life. We can't just say kill the bad guys. That will not solve the problem.
These men know this is their role in their community. They try and reach out to others. They hope of changing their life.
This is my personal belief. There should be more recognition of both groups. This bias can lead to trouble in the future.
Just because of one persons beliefs and mistakes, does not mean that the entire race or religion of those people is wrong.
No one ever gave a counter argument. It only led the professor to continue to use Christianity as his base point for the topics discussed.
It seems that almost every day there is news about some type of conflict or bombing that happened in the Middle East. I feel like you start to become desensitized to the situation.
These are very real concerns. People in the Middle East seem to not care. They are so generous.
The media and our natural belief. About the Afghani culture are the only reasons that can be used to show that the Afghani culture. It is based by violence and hate.
War is a real thing and not just an idea. killing means being killed.
I realize people interpret the Christian teachings differently. It is all based on the same bible.
In terms of religion and spirituality, I think it is better to be selfish. You keep those things to yourself. You try to impose your values on other people.
Some of this does exist in the country. It is not fair to categorize the whole country and everyone in it like this.
How could you justify killing, or ill treatment, of a certain type of people with the Bible?
The Establishment Clause is necessary for a secular state to function. For a country as diverse as the United States to thrive, we must remain secular.
It is very easy to be passive about the news coming from Afghanistan.
The thing I think that really stuck out the most was how brave he was.
It was annoying growing up in Catholic school. You were told what to believe over and over again. They do teach you about other religions. When you're older, you have the ability to explore other religions.
He hasn't seen any change or greater acts of hospitality.
It is so easy to make assumptions about Afghanistan. The only information I learned about that country in middle and high school was negative.
I do not agree with this type of law. I must understand that the people who do follow it most likely have grown up not knowing anything else.
I am more aware. These people are just like people in America.
Afghanistan has suffered a lot. I feel like people just want peace. That is why they are indifferent to which side they choose to support or oppose.
This is because of the Islamic history. The wars that the Islamic world have gone through after the death of Prophet Muhammad Peace Be Upon Him.
The same principles are in both the Quran and the Bible. They still ring true today.
We talked about both sides of the war. It affected both of these men.
I do not want to imagine a world where my life was always in danger. It actually made me sad for everyone in Afghanistan. In America, we are blessed with safety and protection. They will never be able to fully experience that.
I wanted to wear blue jeans and polo to church. It seemed if everyone thought it was a sin not to be dressed formally. Everyone thought is was sinful if we don't go to church ever Sunday.
Much of what the American public knows about Afghanistan stems from the fact that there was a war/conflict over there. Much of what the merican public knows about Afghanistan stems from the persistent Islamophobia throughout our society.
Each nation should have the right to defend its own land. It should make the decision that would best benefit them.
Sam said what obligation. Do we have to learn about it?
But the pure kindness and selflessness Jesus showed through his actions is something everyone should look to embody.
Why God would deny them the entrance to Heaven? It's something a person cannot change.
I realize the need to further educate myself on geography, culture, and physical features.
I would like to ask Rafi a question if I had the chance to again. I would ask why he continues to live in a war zone. I would ask why he raises his family there if fear for safety is such a concern.
Rafi narrated the sad story of the kids who were trying to show a peace sign to American soldiers. They ended up dead by not finding the right bridge to communicate.
It seems even more wrong. Nowadays humans are just a lot more connected. Humans are traveling to a country governed that way could cause problems for the person doing the traveling.
Sam makes an argument. There is just as much of that same type of thinking going on in the United States. It uses the Bible instead of the Quran as a basis for law.
Americans do not always realize this. The war is being fought thousands of miles away from America. They do not see the daily day-to-day struggle. Soldiers and civilians constantly face struggle.
Change can only occur with action. That is something that needs to happen.
Both of these movies portrayed a picture of the land our country is at war with. It is completely unrealistic for many everyday war situations.
Although when the general first was deployed to Afghanistan his beliefs about the culture were probably very different. They are now.
I have never thought about this from this angle before.
I've understood how people can interpret the bible, or any religious text to fit their beliefs.
They have to live with the consequences of this war every day.
It is not like I actively chose to ignore their perspectives. I just only subconsciously saw things from my point of view.
I had never truly thought about how our presence had disrupted the lives of so many in Afghanistan. It gave way to groups such as ISIS.
I haven't been to confession since I was sixteen.
I think he is afraid. He resonates the religion to the radical groups who practice it.
Sams lectured on Black Devils and Racial Supremacy. It made a lasting impression in my mind. I felt it needed to be discussed further.
I agree with the point you made. There is no version of the bible stating that people who are different deserve to face hatred.
Garey said no. His mission was to find the Taliban, not to drink tea. He was just being stubborn.
There is another problem with these sacred texts. They contradict themselves at times.
Later in your response you begin to focus on the media. You discuss how they don't really show the full picture. I fully agree.
Our race is constantly defending the actions of our ancestors.
This spread a politically endorsed statement that we need to protect our country from outsiders. This country was founded through immigration.
Statistics are great and all. We cannot show empathy to a stat sheet.
When the troops leave after a few days, the Taliban takes back control of the villages. The citizens are left in fear.
They put their head down. They go about their business. They're ignorant to what is happening around them.
People have the right. They can believe whatever they want to believe.
It's sad to think about. The citizens of Afghanistan unfortunately can't walk around with the same mindset.
t the end of the day we are all one human race. We are all trying to live our lives.
I have always heard this. An important principle of Christianity is forgiveness. Despite this, God cannot even forgive someone who drinks alcohol.
I know it is wrong. It may just be subconscious in nature. I too just kind of always thought: Oh an Afghani person?
This was my favorite part of the video. This is entirely too true of a statement.
Everybody should be able to practice whatever religion they want.
Reflecting upon the bible quote, Sam said that there is no room for homosexuals in heaven under the Christian religion.
But as Americans are we taught that?
I found it really interesting how he kept trying to make it clear that most of his people do NOT hate America. ISIS is just a small group of extreme radicals.
It is like saying all Germans hate Jewish people. It is simply not true.
I am a Muslim guy. People who interpret the holy Quran as a source for our modern life have to have an excellent background in Arabic, Islamic history and modern sciences.
I bet their interpretation of the bible was to eliminate any individual who opposed a certain pro white idea that they understood from the bible.
The Bible has not been written with adaptability. Its still under the basis of how time was several thousand years ago. I agree that it really isnt to accurate in many of the issues we have now.
It is not fair that we get to ignore these real problems. When, they are affected by them every single day.
The Colonel mentioned, Afghanistan has been in war for seemingly thousands of years. We cannot look past the people who live there.
I know it for a fact. My family would not be welcoming to strangers from another country. They let them inside our house for tea.
He discussed Religious Freedom Bills in certain states. They claim that they should have the right to deny employment to people that they don't like.
I agree with this post. When I picture Afghanistan in my mind I see a desert with destruction. I see war all over the place.
In other words, according to the law, teachers, lawyers, or political figures, cannot express their religious believes. Teachers cannot favor one religion over another to support a certain idea or perspective.
For example, Sam brought up how a given section of Bible scripture states that homosexuals will not be accepted into heaven. Most people are aware of this.
Look at what that specific blurb actually said. A very select few of us will make it heaven in the eyes of the bible.
Putting a face to the war was definitely something I needed to see. It has changed my perspective on it.
They have conflict there. The vast majority of the country is like us. The media does not show that.
Which I think brings up a good point.
After this lecture, it made me want to take a stand. I wanted to make some kind of impact about this topic.
The teachers are what started to push me away from religion.
As sad it is for me to say it, I also always thought of Afghanistan as a war zone with tiny towns and nothing else.
Hearing first hand from someone who was impacted by the events, opened my eyes in ways I didnt realize was possible.
That is whether a person has faith in Jesus Christ.
The same was done by the Spanish in the Philippines.
I was thinking it was something to do with fighting and military action. It turned out to be about politics.
When the tribal leader asked him to come to his house for tea LTC.
Sam compared Islamic Sharia Law to an Christian Sharia. Then I began to see striking similarities.
We should all just step back. We should try to understand one another. This world would be a much better place.
The media made it seem as if the country had always been totalitarian and strict.
Its interesting to get perspective of the war from a soldier who has been there first hand.
He says to love everyone. They are doing exactly the opposite.
Why, after all of these years, can't we look past the differences? Why can't we realize that all of our morals and values are similar?
The furious media coverage that has been following the NFL in example. This was the result of Colin Kaepernick sitting down during the national anthem.
Depending on who I asked, I usually got varying responses and answers.
It makes me feel disgusted about this war. More innocent civilians die than soldiers do.
We should prevent people form being consumed by a religious ideology. We should teach people that all religious texts are meant to be stories which one may read to expand one's world view.
I understood the intention behind switching the dynamic to making white people the victim and making the few people that dont sympathize with the black lives matter movement understand that white supremacy is a thing. He could have gone about in a completely different way.
We do not, however, see the aftermath. The actual events of the civilians being hit with war materials.
The easy way to undercut what Sam is saying here is to point out that pigs and humans are easily more than 20% different. which suggests that genetic similarity may not be the best indicator of sameness
For me, the most important aspect of the Christian religion is the new testament. It is a story full of hope, redemption, change, and forgiveness.
Following the bible's teachings down to the T is not a great idea either.
We discussed what Sharia is. We discussed all of the misconceptions about it.
I know I would not be able to act the same way like him. I may be in a similar situation.
Same goes for transportation. We can now travel, visit, go work and many other things so much easier and accessible. It gives us a whole lot more options and opportunities.
He has actually made me more interested in learning about Islam and the Quran.
I personally feel that this issue should be taken into further consideration. These lives should not be ignored or treated as close to nothing.
We are fortunate to be in a country without an active war zone. This is a major contributing factor to why we so easily forget.
This has been shown throughout history.
This is the same with many Muslims. They aim to live by the Quran.
There are citizens in Afghanistan who live/ previously lived very similar to us.
Like you, my eyes have been opened greatly. It is all thanks to Sam and Rafi's friendship.
I really felt for this man. Throughout his life he has had a variety of groups try to come into his city and take it over.
Sam's lecture tried to show that Christians can be just as awful and inhumane as anyone. Groups like the Lord's Resistace Army run around slaughtering innocents in the name of the Christian God.
The best I can say to motivate people to learn is for American education systems to teach children about other countries' culture including our own.
Hopefully, watching a clip like this can help at least one person. They can look past their narrow point of view. They can realize it is not just Muslims who are violent.
Gay marriage is a taboo topic. It makes most people squirm at a minimum.
Clearly there are occasions where it is necessary and important to open up that dialogue. It feels as though over the past few years it has become almost excessive.
I can relate to what you said about your dad being raised in India. Your dad is able to tell the difference between a person being from south and north.
My aunt got divorced. She later came out as gay.
In America, we try to make a big deal about not judging a book by its cover. We try to give people the benefit of the doubt before we make an assumption. When it comes to acceptance of people from other countries, we immediately assume the worst. We put them into the most negative stereotype possible.
What I got from him speaking on it really just brought me back. It did to a history class with the founding fathers.
Let's say the government forces the bakery to serve the couple. That would actually be conflicting with Sam's point.
I do not see Sam as an open minded professor anymore.
From this video I understood that it really takes stepping out of your own cultural bubble to truly understand other cultures. It is to rid yourself of common misconceptions.
Radical groups draw their  ideology from the same text that I was being taught kindness and tolerance.
However, it demonstrated how the world is changing.
During the crusades white, Christians went out. They murdered 1.7 million people.
We know that today in the United States whether you are a husband or wife you have the ability to get divorced. A divorce cant be refused in the United States.
In my opinion, that was the biggest take away from this video. War is very real.
I was raised by two Catholic parents. Parents who taught me that every Sunday I was to go to church If I did not go to church than I should go to CCD.
He put up pictures of white Christians. The white Christians committed heinous crimes. One person who shot up a black church. He believed that was what the bible was telling him.
He said he had a very different image of what Afghanistan was like from what it actually is. I was thinking the same.
These decisions are what often what leads to arguments. They lead to confrontation of many religious groups. They cause the ever-present possibility of war.
I myself was raised a Catholic. I stopped practicing around age 15. It's because I did not feel that I had true faith in the things I was reading or participating in.
And that the terror that people experience would not be different if a similar tragedy took place back here.
Society has evolved so much today. The values have too.
The news never shows first hand stories on how the Afghan citizens are affected.
I really would just want to see all religions get along. They should agree that the extremists are the scum of the earth.
I never realized the importance of connecting with the people of the villages.
The overarching ideas of these two texts promote good values. They provide ways in order to live better lives.
Sam explains Islam Sharia Law. Being just one of many ways of interpreting the Quran.
I don't have any issue with those who truthfully and wholeheartedly believe and follow their religion.
I think people need to stop trying to interpret the bible. The bible is not suppose to be used to judge other people. The bible is supposed to guide the reader to their own journey.
There are things stated in the bible that get misconstrued.
This hospitality was something that he had not seen in the US.
God will know. You can't fake being serious about trying to be a good follower.
people always say why can't just be peaceful after all we are all humans. LTC Garey goes deeper into the subject.
You believe you are on the side of the good or the just or the righteous. In reality you're incorrect. You are just as incorrect as all before you and ahead of you.
It is only be accepting our ability to war. Can we prevent it.
I think people are so compelled and fascinated by their own religion. People are not able to disagree with others without pointing it out and causing more issues.
It doesn't surprise me. People in this part of the world don't like Americans.
It all depends on what you decide is relevant to your faith. It's the same way with Islam.
People can't make their own educated guesses and conclusions about a topic. They have to take the time out to understand it.
There was fear against the Islamic terrorist groups. They could retaliate against the U.S troops.
This is something I do not think about. I live in America. The war zone is in a different country.
It is no longer acceptable to cut the hand off a thief. It's not acceptable to stone an adulterer. Yet the religious texts make it very clear. These were the punishments these acts deserved.
I think that Lieutenant Garey's responses and stories were very interesting and shocking.
That is a shame. But, at the same time it is the world we live in. Part of being an adult is maintaining employment and making compromises.
In this video, Sam does a great job of explaining it. He uses the analogy of a fish to water.
All of humanity's problems can't be boiled down to be solved in a single book.
The Bible has a finite number of pages. It is unlikely that it could address all of our modern day issues.
Other than that I agree completely about your comments regarding how people view other cultures.
Lastly, I believe that people in the United States only know the worse of the Muslim and Islamic religions.
Many ignorant people just want to go into the army to be able to hold a gun. Many ignorant people just want to shoot people like if it was a video game.
Definitely we have been influenced by movies or TV in general. TV only shows a really small percentage of what soldiers actually and normally do in the middle east.
How could you possibly believe that what you're doing is right?
He points out multiple different laws. There are criminal actions that aren't found in the Quran. People just interpret each infraction.
I definitely agree with you on that fact. People base their views primarily on other people's opinions.
The only way to stay away from this type of thinking is to really have an open mind about different religions. The only way to stay away from this type of thinking is to understand your own religion a little more.
I think it would be very easy to get discouraged living in a war zone. Seeing Rafi's compassion for others and his country is so heartwarming.
I am not a religious person. I respect everybody's right to practice their own religion.
During sitting in class I was listening to him. He made the assumptions of the perfect usage of the bible.
A common understanding of God and even just religion in general is important for morals and principals. This country tries to instill them.
no one ever made the effort  seek out other ways of thinking we would all be closed minded individuals with no culture.
Rafi talked and showed pictures of his family. He talked about how he must fear for his life daily because of his job. It made this new perspective even more real for me.
I already got the point that the system is rigged. Race relations should be about how to fix it currently. Just talking about it wont do anything for anybody.
I agree. We couldn't have a Christian Sharia in this country.
This gave me some perspective. This showed me that the people of Afghanistan are great people too just like us.
You have people who have the same dreams and aspirations as any person in the US. You have radical groups who want to push their ideas down peoples throats.
It destroys everything that he is used to.
Do not be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor those participate in homosexuality.
Is it the stereotype? Do they take away your individuality?
Lieutenant Colonel Garey's personal experience in the Middle East is very eye opening. He has trouble understanding some of the cultural differences at first.
Shelby mentioned, it is very interesting. People for a long time were okay with homosexuals. They were singled out. They realized that the bible also excluded many other groups of people.
I actually feel guilty for not knowing what is going on.
But who's to say there is a correct meaning?
What is shown on television could be the slums. In certain cases, the places most affected by the wars taking place.
I did not realize that the people of the country are very similar to us Americans. Especially when he said they have children, aspirations, jobs and hopes
One of the main points made recently that I found interesting was the comparison between Islam and Christianity (Quran vs the bible).
I think that it was important that Sam brought LTC Gary to speak to our class. When someone who has been at war can present what it truly is like it can give you perspective from the soldiers in these countries.
When you are a member of the church, it is easier to try to distance yourself from the radical hate groups. You say they are not practicing the same religion.
The person that lived in the village only talked when LTC Garey went into his house. LTC Garey later found out that the guy was not talking. There were enemies in the village. The enemies would see him cooperating.
The other example that Sam provides shows us. The readings, should they cover a topic, could be interpreted.
They want the same things for their kids as we do.
To follow a sacred text that was written thousands of years ago may not really apply to todays life situations.
People in the Army are also being affected by this war in Afghanistan.
Most of us when we watch the news about war just listen to it for a couple minutes. We feel bad at the moment. We then continue doing what we are doing.
Something surprised me and also Garey. It was how polite and inviting the Afghan people were to our troops.
People need to stop focusing on what history has made of us. We should start focusing on what we can do to change the path of our religious judgments from the past.
Really read any of the holy works. They all teach morality and a way of life away from hate and violence.
Sam mentioned his friend, Maziar. Maziar used to be in the Iranian military.
I have to agree with you. You said that this has been one of your favorite topics to learn about.
We see the war as a whole. It's quite the opposite.
If he performs oral sex before marriage, is he doomed to hell?
I had the opportunity to see and hear from Rafi Nadiri. I heard about his family and his hardships. It showed me that war is not just an abstract concept. I just am not affected by it in my daily life.
Sam asked LTC Garey who the Afghan people really are.
Sharia Law, be it Islamic Sharia or Christian Sharia, could never work. People would disagree on the actions that are taken.
But it was very interesting to see what it is really like over seas. It was very interesting to hear personal stories about their lives.
I got the alert on my phone. The alert said this class was going to be the best of the semester. I was eager. I was anxious about what was going to happen later that day.
What Sam is doing is so important. It makes me happy a class like this exists at penn state.
I really enjoyed reading your post. I agree completely with what you had to say.
You could ask someone where you thought that picture was taken. I think the last guess would be in Afghanistan. There are misconceptions of that area.
The person who actually wrote the Bible may not have liked gays. This is a guide on how to be a good person.
I think that people do not take other perspectives often. People do not truly know what is going on in the world around them.
Christian extremists are killing masses of people. They kill in the name of God around the world.
We, as Americans, take for granted our safety.
Civilians are affected daily.
Therefore it is not logical to use this book as the final say in all matters of law.
However when watching this activity unfold, I had a very hard time pigeonholing who belonged where.
I sat through these lectures and heard from Rafhi. I now feel compelled to act. I want to help spread peace throughout our country and the world as a whole.
I am a person of the Christian faith. This lesson did not offend me.
Too often do dictators take power. Dictators see the world as tyrannical. It is they themselves who are the tyrants.
It may seem silly. These groups of people use a book, the Quran, as a guide to moral principles. It is used to govern rules in their societies.
We see pictures of the shopping mall, the traffic jam. They were all things we could relate to.
The best you can get here is a friendly response. They regress back into their cell phone.
The Quran and the Bible are truly not that similar. They both teach familiar religious ideas (redemption, forgiveness, love, acceptance). The figureheads of the religions are entirely different.
I think that there's something even worse. This whole situation could have been avoided. Both people would not have had to suffer.
I sincerely hope Basim gets what he deserves. Nobody should ever go through the pain that he went through.
Christian and Muslim core values are usually virtuous. Their texts were written in a different age.
He said he gets threats on his life every single day. He is trying to win women more rights. He must not line up to the liking of ISIS and traditional Afghanis.
Often in Christianity, people view the rules of the Bible to be flexible to fit their own agenda. I find this very interesting.
Nobody will understand life in a warzone, unless they directly experience it. The best thing that people can do is learn first hand about how real and dangerous of a place it is.
I cannot speak much on the Quran. I have not read it. Nonetheless, I assume it is much like the Old Testament to the Bible.
However, I was raised Catholic. I find religion interesting.
I also found it very interesting on how he asked everyone in the class if they would be going into heaven based on the sins that would not allow them on the board.
It states in the Bible that if you are gay you will go to hell.
I have never understood why people spend so much time fixating on the decisions and actions of others.
War Affects Real People stood out to me this week. It struck a nerve.
This lecture definitely spoke to me. I wonder all the time how people interpret the Bible in so many ways. They claim to be a part of the same religion.
Point out the flaws of both religious texts. This emphasizes how similar they really are.
In a similar fashion, movements for equality have continued to occur without any major change.
However, I disagree with your claim. Race and color are two different things.
They all have families, jobs, friends, and a lot of other similarities. We should always take it into consideration before we take any action.
First of all, he was very well educated.
So how can someone justify their actions or discriminate others because of how they personally felt the bible was trying to say.
War is becoming more of an economic reason rather than a safety reason.
Being a follower of a radical religious leader means that those people must be the least smart and self-aware people on this earth.
I've lived in the US my whole life. I've never really been exposed to war and how it affects civilians.
The way he describes how his duties center on understanding other cultural perspectives was the main draw of the video. He also describes the norms of the civilians of other cultures.
This lecture series also really spoke to me. I was unaware of a lot of what Afghanistan was. I didn't know what the war over in the Middle East has been.
It doesn't matter how respectable and civil our troops are. I can imagine that it is still tough to adapt to at times. The circumstances are given.
I was intriguied about what he had to say. This was the most important question posed during class.
It was important that Sam discussed this.
Am coming from the same place as you. I don't have much background information on why this war is continuing for so long. I don't understand why we even started it in the first place.
I feel like other people should learn not to judge someone by the area that they live in. people should actually give people a chance to show who they are as a person. people should not group all of one ethnicity into a category just because of whats happening in the world.
Continuing to do this is only going to lead to more hate and conflict.
I learned how the soldiers have to work hard. Soldiers understand the people's cultural norms. Otherwise there can be tons of miscommunication and problems.
I didn't know what Sharia Law was. We learned about it in class.
I have decided to respond to the video clip. Sam was discussing radicalizing the Bible in the video
Words and a couple pages tied together hold all of the power. The power is undeniably intimidating. It is in some cases deadly.
My home town is one of the places the Establishment Cause is designed for.
Realizing that the civilians being killed over seas are real people makes the concept of war a little less foreign and a lot more scary.
Our sports teams are very diverse. The good players are not always stereotypical race that goes with the sport.
I feel that it is everyone's duty to at least understand. War is a tangible and real thing.
Growing up in a Christian family and going to church every Sunday it is safe to say. I have had my fair share of exposure to the religion.
Why is it so hard for Christians to see Muslims as christians and vise-versa?
I might face small difficulties. The difficulties are nothing compared to people living in third world countries.
I thought this was a really fascinating point.
These people protest against the LGBT community. They claim their faith commands them to.
But some people read them and use them as a means to justify their clearly wrong and hateful actions.
There is a big argument against the holiness of confession. There are thousands of Catholics and Christians who won't go to mass every Sunday.
He even tried to withhold further bad news. He hesitated to tell us that the United States only offered him about 2 thousand dollars to compensate for the complete destruction of his home and family.
I understand how important religion and faith is to those who choose to believe. But, to allow that religious novel to be what you live your life by is ridiculous.
There's much culture within areas in America. We don't now what's there more than we don't know what's outside of our country.
For myself, when meeting new people, I often think about where they come from.
I still don't know that much about war. Getting that wake-up call that war is a real thing, that involves real people like all of us, has made a difference in my view.
He tells of the political leaders in Afghanistan who came to this gathering to encourage citizens to vote.
I agree with you when you say this. We should just use the Bible as the basis or foundation on which we establish our society.
We never mind the fact. Often times these opponents are also Christians. They are just not fundamentalists.
Such a system would not be accepted by most in the modern world.
Hearing about both the lives of the Afghan people, and the soldiers that serve our country made me forever grateful.
Telling people that God or any supernatural being would punish them for eternity if they were to break any rules allowed governments to control people. It allows governments to manipulate them to do anything.
I wonder how many more people would be interested in actually helping the people.
I have always felt that God is a lover of all people. It's regardless of what one verse in one chapter of the Bible says.
Many practicing hold the Bibles scripture as law. They aim to live by it, word for word.
Some light research will tell you that pigs and humans are about 80% genetically the same. It undermines the ethos of Sam's argument a little.
I was raised Christian and went to Catholic school.
When he was speaking about the one man who was changing his affiliation with whoever was in charge at the time.
From the outsider perspective America is seen as a nation that should always help others.
You get married because you love the person unconditionally. Something might happen where they cannot have children. It shouldn't be so easy to just leave them.
Views on abortion and gay rights are a lot more socially acceptable. The Bible was written.
He said this as if it was the most ridiculous thing he has ever hear.
Decide there is no reason to be good. Give in to temptation without hesitation.
It's not because we mean to. We also grow up surrounded by stereotypes and common misconceptions.
There should be no religious affiliation in the government. That does not carry over to private businesses.
Sam dug deeper. He went on to discuss questions that pertain to these issues.
I am way more aware of the reality of Afghanistan now than I was before. I think everyone needs to be informed on it as well.
I believe that they are raised to hate a separate group. They only use the holy works to justify their hate of other groups. How could anyone read the Bible and interpret it to hate any one group of people?
It was great to hear from Rafi.
How could we possibly let it govern our lives?
We think that so much of the Sharia law principles are so strict and foreign to us. They're really not.
I believe this is a controversial topic. Many people probably have different opinions on this subject.
As a Christian it is easy for me to make the separation between me and a white nationalist who says they are Christian.
They said they bring gifts every time they visit. However, they do not have high incomes.
Listening to Rafi talk about much power a woman has . Regards to splitting with her husband is really interesting.
They are breathing living religions that are constantly changing and forming new opinions about different topics.
There were many different aspects of the recent lectures that strongly stuck with me.
For example, in movies, we see the action-packed scenes in which soldiers are shooting each other in ruined cities as bombs go off everywhere around them.
For my older sister the Bible worked. The Bible did not work for me.
I need to do better than that.
The Quran states that Those who consider the Quran to be mere fables will be branded on the nose (Quran 68:15-16).
I judge from what the soldier said. This seems to be quite the opposite. He was treated with decent hospitality.
Why will no one educate us on the innocent people overseas? Americans will keep assuming they are all bad. The fighting will never stop.
Therefore, that is where my beliefs and moral compass was developed.
However, when white supremacists are marching and chanting threatening speech towards minorities, then race IS the issue.
Think about it, you are welcoming a complete stranger into your home. You are without any knowledge about them.
Not everyone is nice. Some people just want to make money. They do not care how it affects others.
We must realize that both books have truths hidden in them. It is our duty to live out those truths.
You made me think when you said you tried to picture an America where you were always scared for your life. It really puts into perspective how sad and scary the whole concept of war really is.
I liked how he spoke about the war. The war took a lot from their country. The people are friendly.
War is terrible in many ways. War is inevitable.
Let's say they aren't allowed to mix church and state. The majority of the country is Christian. It's hard not to use the two together.
This is definitely true when talking about Afghanistan.
We need better understanding. They can become more appreciated in other countries.
Since 2001, the numbers of Afghan civilians killed have grossly increased.
Everything involving Sharia is relative.
Live and let live is exactly right.
What about the people who don't follow the book?
I personally believe. This is something taught in groups.
The Colonel stated they have aspirations and hopes. They come home from work, share a meal, and go to sleep.
This is the exact same thing that ISIS is doing.
But to those people who fight it and live it, the war is the center of their universe.
This is something that is needed. It is for a country to be successful.
They come from a country they are used to - big cities, lots of cars and storefronts. There is not a lot of desert to a place where there is a lot of people but not a lot of space for those people to live.
I did not know much about Afghanistan before the speakers. I certainly did not think they were just like us!
Many of the same people regularly share parables on social media. The same people promote putting the Christ in Christmas.
He risks his life everyday. Even after his close friend and partner was killed, for the greater good to make Afghanistan as safe and stable as it could be.
If everyone acted like Jesus, the world would obviously be a better place.
LTC Garey informed the class that very few times he has been in high danger. He has been in high intensity situations overseas.
This interaction is truly amazing. It brings people from across the world together.
The Quran is a holy book. It is very much similar to the Bible.
If the Bible was going to cover every issue possible it would have to be much longer.
We talked about this in our discussion class.
I have always believed that the Bible is the only resource that can bring humans closer to God.
Like not stealing, killing, or hurting others emotionally.
I thought it was interesting to hear what he thought. He said nice things about that first picture that came up in the class.
What the media doesn't show American's is how generous Middle Easterners genuinely are.
This is incredible naive. To believe that I thought this for any amount of time makes me sick.
That is not necessarily a fault of ours. It is something that cannot be understood and forgiven.
And that for two decades they have kept living in this tragic state.
The basis of the hatred definitely starts off with our differences. They start in how we look, act, are raised, and so on.
Every religion picks and chooses which issues they support and don't.
It made me think of my family. I cant even imagine what it would be like to grow up in a war zone.
It lightens the mood. It gets everyone's attention for the juicy stuff he gets into next.
Religion should be used to bring communities together. It should not build walls between them.
Someone else might have a different reason as to why they might have had a bad impression when the first think of soldiers. I would like to know about this.
Sharia law in the Middle East forces women to cover themselves. It puts men above women.
For instance, the leaders previously election in the government and town leaders all come together. The leaders meet in one place. They can encourage individuals from all over to come out and vote in this years election.
For example, I completely agree that the media does put too much emphasis on race in their headlines. They especially do so on criminal trials.
I chose this video. It's because I thought it was a really important piece of class.
I have done a decent amount of traveling. I have found this to be a majority exclusive to our country.
The Bible and the holy Quran share many similar lessons. They share historic events that shaped the history of humanity.
We saw the chart of the civilian deaths. I just thought about how some people with similar aspirations to my own would be unable to fulfill them. They may be caught up in a war that they do not even want.
We need to have these discussions about the histories of our texts. This is in order to show how they are merely stories told for centuries.
Instead, we just sit here and live within our tightly circles. We're afraid to branch out.
When he comes back he tells us stories. One story he told us was how he and his wife went out on the back porch of the house in Lebanon. His wife said wow look at the beautiful fireworks. He had to inform her that it was not fireworks. actually bombs going off.
I remember thinking how this could happen. The reality is it is does happen.
Now, it is more understandable that so many US soldiers come back to the states with symptoms of PTSD. PTSD takes a while, if not the rest of their lives, to overcome these horrific memories as a soldier. Soldiers  must find the death of innocent civilians as hard to watch as the death of their fellow soldiers.
Nothing of what was said by Gary would be construed as rational thought by a majority of people in society. The fact that he is willing to ignore one of the most fundamental principles of our government is astounding.
Sams friend talked about how he had no hate towards Americans in general. More just prayed for himself and prayed for his family. We have a totally different aspect on life than people from other countries
The harsh reality of this is the following. That's the complete opposite to what others see the U.S. as.
Sam mentioned the real things in Afghanistan. He showed us an example of the real people there.
We can do an interactive activity without offending people. I know several students were offended. They felt uncomfortable by what was said and presented.
It was really eye opening to hear about Sharia. The true definition of Sharia law is eye opening.
They know that there will be conflict. That it is unavoidable.
I have always thought that Afghanistan was just supposed to be hated. Therefore, I do not see it as a home or a safe place.
I believe that we all too can have a mindset. Rafi is able to be a strong advocate for peace while living in a war zone, receiving death threats, and losing innocent loved ones due to the war.
Not everyone affiliated with sharia law are terrorists.
The media needs to do a better job of representing the peaceful Islamic people as well as the spiteful Christian people.
I think that the material presented is definitely important. The material requires a thought-provoking discussion. We shouldn't have to switch roles in order for certain people to understand.
I also agree. This was an eye opening exercise for me.
I wouldnt want to be judged as a Christian on the actions of Westboro Baptist Church. I don't agree with the way they choose to follow God.
One story in particular that has stuck in my mind. Jesus says if your leg or arm or hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it into the fire.
This idea had amazing intentions. It effectively accomplished them.
The class should be about coming up with a solution to the current problem.
This same perspective can be flipped. It can be said about the Afghani people as well.
It's hard to completely eradicate the sensitive or touchy words, ideas, and topics.
This could not be more wrong.
These are never really things that come to our minds when Afghanistan is mentioned.
Many were forced to remove their hijab. They feared public reaction.
This should be applied to the way Muslims are treated in America on a daily basis
I have been to church, it is a wonderful place to learn a lesson and see people. It is my feeling that most people there probably aren't really practicing what they preach.
His analysis on peoples physical features has opened my eyes. I see how they can play a role in an environment and determining individuality.
The governor of the province was trying to get people's votes. The civil way caught my attention.
No one wants to feel stupid.
Many civilians in the middle east have been living in conflict for their entire lives. Many have lost many loved ones.
I can see what you are saying about interpreting the Bible differently.
We try to paint the world as this idealistic place. Happiness and compassion and empathy should rule. We need to address our innate drive toward violence.
All of a sudden I felt empathy for not only him. I felt empathy for all of the other people that have had to go through the same thing but never got their story told.
They both believe the culture is giving and welcoming.
Sam said it in the video. Other countries barely speak on their versions of racism.
I found it interesting. The in ROTC spoke about his service overseas.
I can tell when someone is from certain parts of the state. It depends how they say certain words.
I wouldn't call myself a very religious person. I do have faith. I have a religious outlook on some issues.
However, there are still individuals that choose. They only find what they want to recognize as a sin.
Do not spare them. Do not shield them.
Christians were going out and killing residents at other nations if those residents did not convert to Christianity.
It reminded me. They are not all that different from people in America.
Their acts, along with their twisting of what I believe to be right bother me It makes me question the Bible.
I thought it was funny. Very eye-opening that Sam asked everyone to raise their hands. They did not go against the bible in any way, only one person raised their hand.
It is dangerous to assume that someone is of good character simply because of a claim of faith.
It was so interesting to listen about this topic. It is something you hear about and see on the tabloids daily.
He came to the conclusion that learning the culture was important.
It prevents the Christian majority in my home town from dominating all others.
You must recognize something. Claim the same of your own religion.
A lot of people in the United States will talk about this issue. Before they get married because a good chunk of the population would like to have children.
The British colonized half the world, killing millions in the process.
As a Christian, I do believe that the Bible is incredibly ambiguous.
It means that the small Atheist, Jewish, Islamic, and Hindu population can attend public school without feeling completely allientated. Our very curriculum is suited towards white Christian history and literature.
This conflict of interest in the Bible opens up the argument. What happens to a homosexual that has faith in Jesus Christ?
There are malls and highways full of cars. There are people doing the same things I do at home.
It has little to do with religion.
I liked this post. I too had the same feeling. Professor Richards said that the Quran and the Bible were not that different.
Sam pointed it out multiple times in his lecture. He prays. He doesn't believe in a god.
The war  is affecting real peoples lives.
Garey said he showed up in a village. An old man offered him tea. He thought it was a trick. This shows how we were raised.
It turns out that American soldiers care about the lives of these people more than anyone.
We truly never know what actually happens until we hear about it first hand. I am grateful to learn. I'm grateful listen to Rafi's story.
I now realize how important it is to stay educated after these lessons. I now understand the lives of the innocent Afghan people.
To me it just seems like the founding fathers had it right. They keep church and state separate.
The laws that Sam quoted from a majority of states were absurd. This was shocking to me.
Little children are growing up in a war zone. Dying over a fight that they do not understand, Civilians are being murdered over a fight that likely did not involve them specifically.
Logically, soldiers develop a deep trust and love between one another. This happens through moments of extreme fear, sadness, or relief. This was mentioned by LTC Gary.
I couldn't agree with you more.
It is bad enough that women in America are still treated unequally and unfairly. Unequality is mainly a problem in the workforce. It is impossible to fathom what it must be like to be a woman of the Middle East.
He said that if the Taliban is there, then he is a member of the Taliban. If the Americans are there, he is for their cause.
I agree the old testament is flawed. I dont believe christianity should be vilified for this part of itself.
The four reasons all make sense. Of course, any reason should be a reason if you do not want to remain married to someone.
If I were in the shoes of the civilians, I would not have as much respect for the soldiers as they deserve.
Christians are quick to forget. They caused an entire holy war during the Crusades.
The future of war across the world is unclear. As long as the tensions in the middle east stay unresolved, then we are all at risk.
I believe that this also brings an interesting spin on how people view it.
I completely agree with your statement. In our society we are numb to the war that is happening overseas.
It is supposed to be a somewhat serious matter. They are selecting the next individuals who are going to lead them. They also want to show them how to be relaxed and enjoy the experience.
If troops from a foreign nation were walking in my neighborhood, I would not feel the urge to invite them in for tea or anything.
The southern states supported slavery even after they lost the civil war. The sothern states didnt believe in equality.
Our society likes to find groups or individuals to blame. That can lead to even more stereotyping.
My personal relationship with my religion and faith is what led me to see Sam's argument so easily. I already mostly believed it myself.
It can be a christian coffee shop, muslin bakery, or atheist restaurant. The company should have the ability to practice their religion in their work place.
The second point I disagree with you on is you saying that a person should rely on their experiences. I believe it should be the written words of a book, to guide their lives.
I've always believed that religious texts are open to a variety of interpretations.
If that was said about a white person it would be a huge deal. Nobody seemed to bring it up during class.
Sam shows us. Afghanistan has shopping malls and small family shops, too.
Sam begins to unpack this much more later in his lecture. This preface for the lecture truly gave me and Im sure my peers much more perspective of Islam in the middle east.
I think the media has a lot to do with the way Americans view Afghanistan.
I feel like hearing the story from Sam. I was able to actually talk. I ask questions. It was an amazing experience. and I was glad to be a part of it.
Just like many Christians, many Muslims do not count ISIS as a Islamic group. How they interpret the Quran is not that same as how ISIS interprets it.
These locals were stuck in an indeterminable position. Both sides could be a potential threat.
It would be beneficial for everyone to discuss this topic. That would be better than quietly continuing to think negatively about a group of people that you may not know much about.
I feel that homosexuals may not invited to the Christian community. That is hypocritical.
He went in not knowing much of their culture and their ways. He left frustrated. He didn't get the information he needed.
It upsets me immensely. People like us living overseas in a different country have to live with the everyday possibility of dying.
I also thought this specific class was interesting and insightful.
It is so great to be able to better understand the world around us!
White people aren't called the white devil. Such a thing would be rude and condescending. Why is it ok when we use that phrase for black people?
We have all heard the statistics about racism in the work place.
This seems harsh for Hollywood to do to citizens in movies. It happens in real life.
In Islam, Muslims are supposed to follow the rulings of the Quran and the Hadith.
In this present, we are aware of the many wars happening in other countries.
I liked the repetition of his account of the people having the same jobs, hopes, even aspirations. It visualizes for us, the audience, their life as more than people stuck in a warzone.
I personally had a hard time imaging everyday people living in Afghanistan.
This segment of class really opened my eyes. Living in a conflict zone can affect people just like me.
The word Satan is taken from the Egyptian word Set. Set is known to be the god of death, Anubis.
Does this make shaving a sin?
I believe when technology evolves and everyone has the opportunity to be exposed to several points of views, then violence through religion and religious ideologies like Sharia will be abolished.
Soldiers leave war with many unique stories and experiences. That is why they might have different feelings towards other cultures.
If it can happen in Christianity it can happen with any religion or belief system. This is important to consider before we pass judgements on those who are different from us.
I have been exploring other religions. My mother is okay with it.
So why does our culture fail to recognize that we are surrounded by so much picking and choosing?
I was never really interested in the thought of going to church. My parents wanted me to go. As always, I listened.
Religion only gives people the audacity to flaunt their beliefs. They claim that their words are of higher power.
It was interesting. He connected using social media to being a reviler. It' like using abusive language. Many people engage in that on a daily basis.
Divorces in this day and age are inevitable. Not everyone is as compatible as they thought.
A lot of the laws seemed written in ways that dodged equality. It makes sense when you think about the time period.
This class has bored me at this point. I sit here completely unimpressed.
People begin to label other people. They don't know who that person really is.
Iran is being known as an enemy state of the US, Maziar talked and laughed with the former US military members, sharing experiences. They had a special connection with a lot in common.
Not being able to have a family is a very important thing for most people.
Sam showed us the pictures of Rafi's family and other families in Afghanistan. It put the war in a new perspective for me.
I agree that a majority of people who voted for Trump blatantly ignores his flaws. I can not believe that Trump would allow somebody like that to work for the government.
Sam's example about divorce puts things in perspective. We need millions of pages just to describe the legality of divorce.
People have always been told that Whites are superior.
Every human being is capable of composing their own thoughts and beliefs. Using one book to solve every known problem is bound to lead to arguments.
Time has passed. People have chosen to forget.
I agree that religion should not be part of the state. Religious people should have the ability to serve and hire people based on their religious beliefs.
Some Christians interpret the Bible in a peaceful manner. Others view it in agressive, violent terms.
Sam pointed this out in the video. It only takes one blowjob.
But he needed to explain why this white dominant government system is a problem.
These events can transpire in Middle East. Why couldn't they happen here?
Cooperation between the U.S. and the Middle East is important. It breaks down any predispositions between the two groups.
Taking a step back and comprehending that fact kind of blows me away.
Sam had mentioned. I group people based on their ancestry.
I think it is important for us as humans to try and learn more about what is going on around the world. The less we know the more we contribute to this problem.
The world would certainly be a better place. People should take a look in the mirror. People should accept that their personal way of life isn't better than anyone else's.
The only human to be without sin was Jesus. Those who wrote the Bible and translated were not without flaws.
Families are forced out of their homes.
It is so easy to forget about what is going on outside of America. So many things in our country come easy to us.
He showed a picture of a mall just like ones we find here in America. He explained that many people would think they had a small, beat down mall or not even any malls at all. Because we judge before we really know what anything is like.
Why do they act? They never committed sins.
It is almost like we underestimate war when it is portrayed in the news.
I completely disagree with the statement. Sam said we are moving towards Sharia.
It is important to show everyone the similarities of the two cultures.
You have to truly regret, even wholeheartedly believe you will try to do better. It won't matter what the priest says.
Think of some places like Afghanistan & Pakistan, you think of a war zone. That is exactly what these places are.
It's different for me to imagine this. It's because of everything we have learned.
I feel like I can't be that bad on the grand scale, right?
This video does an excellent job in explaining this perspective. The people living in Afghanistan are people too.
There are to many levels. It has to pass legislation.
We need to compare the histories of all religious texts. In order to truly understand the underlying metaphysical structure between them. To show that they are truly all the same meta stories told in different manners.
These people might not even be personally involved or invested. These people are pitted against each other due to this conflict.
What those people were was Christianity. I thought they were very wrong. Being in any way associated with them makes me sick.
We listened in class to Sam speak and show images. It makes us more aware of the world. We know how to take a different perspective.
This gives off a vibe that some Christians, not all, are basically constructing their own way of doing things. Their way is not presented in the Bible.
Many people in this country are not religious. They don't live by the Bible. They practice different faiths that don't coincide with the Bible.
For example, Sam presented the class with a list of daily problems that pop up in everyday life.
I believe it is an important book in Christian history. It should not be used to determine the outcome of any legal matters.
I agree. The issues that Sam brought up should be discussed. Nonetheless, I think there could have been a better format.
They go to work. They watch television. They root for their favorite sports teams. They look for love just like we do.
He starts with a quote from Corinthians. It clearly states homosexuals will not go to heaven.
This lesson meant a lot to me. I think it can really resonate with me. Additionally, it could really help my dad.
Women are encouraged to come out and vote. Leaders want as many people as they can get to participate in each years election. Leaders are looking for better turnouts each year.
I had the exact reaction when Sam asked what we think when someone says 'Afghanistan.'
They wake up every day living a life of fear.
Kenneth, I too wrote about this video. I completely agree with your points.
In reality, Muslims are very peaceful people. They mean no terror to anyone.
He makes a good point about how the Quran and the Bible are similar. You just have to look at what he is saying.
The Christian religion preaches that God loves everyone equally. Why is there a checklist of criteria that must be met for someone to go to Heaven, though?
It was really amazing to see how Rafi has flourished with his career, family, and overall life.
Another point I wanted to bring up. The U.S offered Basim nothing for destroying his home and killing his family members.
It is sad. Afghanis have to live their daily lives knowing that could be killed at any moment.
I think Sam succeeded in his lecture.
It's as Sam mentioned. People are trying to make a Bible-based world in the United States.
I did not know that it could actually be used for any religion. Our country already has been using this for some time.
One of the questions that largely supported his claim was asking if they believed in sharia government.
I think that really trying to communicate with everyday people from other countries will help diminish this fear of the unknown. I think that trying to communicate with everyday people from other countries will lead to a better chance for peace.
He gives several examples of Christian people. They are criminals, living by the Bible.
They are caught in the middle of it.
This prejudice needs to change. Or we will never advance as a society.
The attempt to bring religion into politics is seen too often.
Perhaps the only way we could learn that these countries are not as poor as we think would be to look into things ourselves.
Every day I wake up  not worry about  my safety. I begin to embark on what's in store for the day.
I completely agree. There is a Christian homophobic agenda.
It is eye opening to realize that our core values really do not stray far from those of Muslims.
It is impossible to tell. Different people will say different things.
I think of all the American soldiers lives. They are being affected by the war.
In the Bible it might not say that whites are superior, It does not say that they are not arguing against whether someone interpreted the Bible in the wrong way would be a pointless argument.
There's no way to kill people without having a loss of life on both sides.
Many fundamentalists just focus on the line about homosexuals. They ignore the rest.
I understand that many religions do have their differences. The holy books that we read from and live by are more similar than different. why must we base our hatred on them?
Instead of everyone recognizing the fact that both Islamic extremists and right-wing extremists both exist, people just choose to view the media that fits. People just choose what they want to believe.
It is hard to find someone that believes and follows duties that say that homosexuals, fornicators, thieves, and more cannot go to heaven .
It is only through active reflection that you would be able to figure out a religion actually does fit you. You could learn many things by being open enough to hear their arguments.
I take comfort in the idea. I have the ability to live by my own moral code.
Is it because of the rigorous training that reminds them of Greek hazing?
Followers are confronted with the decision to follow the more conservative route. They take bits and pieces of what they want to hear and read from their sacred tomes.
In real life death is permanent. Respawning does not exist.
I was receptive to the teachings of Christ. I was aware of passages that contradicted others. Other passages were outright ignored.
I also never understood how people could read a scripture this way. They develop a whole other meaning than what was there.
When I think of war, I don't take into consideration how much down time the soldiers have.
Although the bible does tell us about how people should live, die, marry, and divorce the bible is solely a tool for lost individuals to use as a guide to find new hope.
Any of you who have traveled to another country have probably noticed signs of racism elsewhere in the world, and if you havent then you clearly werent paying attention. Because there is no place in the world completely free of this problem.
Overall, I think it is pretty cool to be able to tell.
Many have blamed all Muslims for the casualties that have surfaced since we started the war overseas.
People who are religious leaders base their entire life around their religion. This is usually from a younger age.
The Bible is made up of multiple books from different authors.
The problem with this is people in general are a complex species. We have developed since this book was first written.
People have such a negative view on Islam. Try to learn about it in reality. You'll understand that it's a beautiful religion.
When the Americans come in they want everyone to support them and if you dont you will most likely be captured or killed if you pose a threat.
I do not know much about Sharia. Sam did make some interesting points about it.
There was conversation between both sides. There was the visual aid for the retold history. I think the class can agree. These lectures were very impactful.
This instructor was never told to change his teaching methods. This goes to show the ignorance pertained to this law expressed by authorities in my school and most likely many others.
I am sure mothers and fathers across the nation would not like to tell people that their son came back in a body bag because of our oil interests.
I think that your first sentence is slightly off.
The constitution was not written for all people.
I found it very eye-opening. We learned about how similar the Quran and Bible are. That really opened my eyes. Our Christian radical groups are very similar to the Muslim extremists that we are taught to hate.
Prior to learning about the afghan people, it was easy to put a negative connotation with these people.
It made me appreciate things better. I can only imagine myself living in Afghanistan. Where I only want peace. I am surrounded by danger all the time. while the rest of the world thinks I am involved with the evilness.
I am a strong supporter of talking about race more. America is lucky that we speak on this issue at all.
In addition, it strengthens the ideas. Everyone has their faults.
But when it starts to radicalize and become about hating those who don't believe and those who are interpreted to be wrong. That is when i have an issue with it.
To me, this was the reason I thought they were always in war with America.
I learned more about the faith I was brought into. I found differences in what I believed to be right. I found things about how God wanted me to live.
I do not mean the specific things a religion has to offer. I mean the moral ground it can give someone.
I think it is very important to be aware. Do not judge people. Not everything is as it is shown on the media.
I did not think of them as terrorists. I think of them as Muslims who are still paying for the 9/11 attack.
Radical Christians may, for example, spew so much hatred towards homosexuals. They are blind to the fact that they are equally guilty according to the Bible.
A moment hit me with how real this war is. It's when Rafi first spoke to the class.
Its crazy to think. We could easily be in the same situation as the Afghan people.
Sam then mentions a strong argument regarding Donald Trump. The argument can be used for other politicians.
I was surprised by many of LTC Garey's comments. This was regarding how most of his time was spent during his tour in Afghanistan.
For Afghans life Rafi, his exposure to America and his friendship with Sam allows him to disbelieve the single story the rest of the world has of America.
Afghanistan was probably just like how State College is.
I feel. My dad's position is a very common christian perspective.
I liked what he said. It gave me a different view of the citizens of Afghanistan.
For this reason, I'm in favor of the establishment clause. I believe that this law should be more heavily enforced.
This connected to the message of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichies Ted talk on The Danger of a Single Story.
I became disenfranchised with the Catholic church. I saw problems within the organization.
It scares me to think that the Taliban were at the arrival of the US troops in that village. The troops could not tell them apart from the local citizens.
Rafi is one of the Sharia law influencers in Afghanistan. He is a feminist.
Their families are missing them. Thinking they're going to return home to them.
Knowing the above. I understand that the Religious Freedom Bills are made to discriminate against the LGBTQ community. That is not right I disagree with part of the example he read us during class.
That's why I think classes like Soc 119 are so important.
However, he follows up by listing off a bunch of other things. They also prohibit people from getting into heaven.
How we perceive the actions of others is an important way of being able to communicate with people.
Why make a new word up when there are plenty of slang toward black people already?
I think living in the US has shaped this way of thinking for me.
It is also important to say here. This .1% difference is not limited to race. It applies to all individuals.
There are the three exceptions as to when women can request a separation. They still have nearly no say. Being a woman myself, I don't know how they put up with it.
The war doesn't directly affect a lot of us, including myself. It is easy to just forget about it and focus on ourselves. I don't know anyone that is fighting in the war.
This video suggested something to me. Conflicts such as these put barriers between people. They could otherwise be friends.
It is so sad that his story was never on the news.
Fortunately, it does not concern me.
How could someone tell me to believe in something? They do not know the extent of it.
He was responding the same way. Many have responded to racial issues that have been happening in the U.S.
That is how most people are in the United States. We, especially younger people, only think about things revolving around ourselves.
I believe all of this. The crime, the war, is all rooted in miscommunications.
Homosexuality itself is innate. A person cannot choose to be gay or straight.
When you think about war and it becomes real, you begin to feel the pain of these people. Not only are the soldiers on both sides dying but the casualties of innocent lives is another tragic reality.
We should always try to fight for others even when it seems hard to do.
It's easier to assume our troops are doing the right thing by killing citizens in Afghanistan. In reality innocent people are dying.
Sam hyped it up as being the best class of the semester. While many good points were made and emphasized, I and those around me felt uncomfortable at times.
Nowadays, the difference is always put on the spotlight. The similarities are buried by the media.
I think that it is true. We kind of did become desensitized to the whole war.
How exactly should the Quran or the Bible be followed?
Dr. Richards does a great job of narrating these difficult discussions. He uses humor to lighten up the room.
Oftentimes, we rely on the media's perspective to form our own opinions. We have a lack of knowledge.
His vision of the country had him think something untrue. The fact that he was being offered tea was thought to be a trick, which ended up to be sincere.
Shown are pictures of city traffic jams.
Sam states that Christians only read the things that they want to read.
This country is one of the largest Christian nations. There are still many who do not practice it.
I think this is an interesting point of Sam to make. I had never really thought about this. I do not use my religion in my daily life to make decisions.
It is very important to understand the cultures of other people. I have recently learned that.
I enjoyed learning about their culture as well.
If we were to talk more to the people there, would Americans be more reluctant to continue going to Afghanistan?
We only rely on the fact that this is happening really far away. It might not affect us directly.
I find it very hard to listen to people who use bibles or other religious literature. They point out mistakes made by other people.
Rafi is truly such an inspiration to men/women worldwide. It shows in his speeches.
There has been no stable leader. That has caused this country to be so chaotic.
Two people can be presented with the same topic. They have completely different views on it.
Let's say people were to acknowledge the problem. They agree to work towards a solution. The wounds of the past could heal. We could begin to move forward.
He is using this point to connect Christian sharia to Islamic sharia law.
This is what I think Sam was getting at when he showed the Bible verse from Corinthians.
I do not think you or I have the same beliefs as them.
Sam did a great job by telling us the story of Bisham. Actually having him to speak to us was a life changer.
There are people that are ignorant of things the Bible says clearly.
Many of the points that you have highlighted breaks down the value of the talk.
We have to find a way to cope with this religious ignorance. Approaching religion freely the way one desires is definitely not the solution.
I think that even the thought of using the Bible as a platform for decisions, especially in law, is kind of ridiculous for the country we live in.
Except for your random recession or the dreaded depression, we have a generally stable ecosystem here.
Sam is able to demonstrate how this law is not a very good way of maintaining order.
I think this. Religion is very general. There are no true specifics. It leaves it up to interpretation.
I think a lot of us. Those of us not involved in the war. Have a lack of understanding of Afghanistan.
I'm not saying that Jesus or Mohammed would approve of the acts of ISIS, the LRA, or the KKK. could you blame those hate/terror groups for interpreting their respective holy books that way?
Why are we so quick to judge all Muslims on the radical actions of a small group?
I feel like we are brought up to believe that these people are all horrible. Even the citizens of these countries are the enemy.
There are going to be radical people in every religion.
The smallest differences are enough to instill doubt and fear into other groups. What will it actually take to avoid the pattern of hypocrisy?
I grew up knowing about the bible and hearing about it on Sunday mornings.
Had I been raised in the same situation, I would most likely follow Sharia law. I would view other types of law as very strange.
Sam talked about it. We have a vision built into our minds as Americans. It paints an unfair picture of Muslims.
I found myself having to agree with things. I did not truly believe them.
This leads to hate group, racism, etc.
The way Sam compared the Bible to the Quran was extremely effective evidence. The two religions are more similar than people think.
These issues cannot remain unresolved forever. We wish to make progress.
It does not say one is worse than the other. They chose to single out this one piece of criteria.
They have many of the same things as we do here. I think that the media mainly focuses on the negative. We do not get a chance to see the way of life that the Afghans live. It's not as easy to gain empathy for them.
I think that while it is definitely important to talk about poverty in other places, we also need to discuss the poverty in our own country.
I cannot even wrap my head around the thought. A strong bond must form from surviving a war together. Both while they are in a war and when they come home.
I just grew up thinking that Afghan people were bad. We were fighting them and I did not even know what for.
I am fortunate enough to not wake up and stress about being killed by an act of war.
This is only because as a culture we tend to not let some things go. It's especially true for those that affect us personally.
Why would I want to walk around calling myself a believer? This is a religion that I don't agree with.
I was truly honored and privileged to have him. He was such a brave, heroic man. He came to our class to talk to us.
In hearing this lecture, I gained two very valuable insights. It was regarding the War on Terror and the people involved.
To his surprise, the culture shock he experienced resulted in a positive outcome. He was taken aback by the hospitality.
He had talked about how he learned how generous the people of Afghanistan are.
It doesn't make sense to me.
The media only makes it seem like THEY are evil. Most citizens of those countries are just normal people. They have families and jobs and a normal life, just like Basim.
It is the responsibility of every individual to educate themselves on the history of human kind. That may enable us to improve our sight.
I grew up in a diverse area. It was common to see people of all backgrounds. I was taught that we are all equal.
You cannot simply force everyone to agree with your religions values. You can't force ways to live life. There are so many different religions you can be a part of!
I tend to formulate my morals independently from the Bible.
I have family members who were in the military.
Many children have been killed by American soldiers. The problem is the absence of cultural bridges between the two cultures.
I took a world religions class my first semester in college. I was first introduced to all of the similarities and differences between religions there. I sometimes forget about them and talking about it. Sharia Law brought back some points Ive thought of before.
It has also made me aware of my identity.
Sam asked how many of us violated the Bible based on the actions he described. Only one person raised his hand.
This is an example of interpreting the Bible differently. People place more value on one segment over another.
People mention Afghanistan. The first think I think of is war.
This fact, in my opinion, makes said radical groups in the wrong.
I don't know how I lived 19 years believing that all of Afghanistan looks the way I thought it did. I thought it was like it does in the movies American Sniper & Saving Private Ryan.
I cannot imagine fearing walking out of my own front door. I don't know whether today will be my last day to live.
In general, every religion believes in a god or many gods. The general idea of every religion is to be a good civilian.
But we need to do better than that.
These stories are narrated by people that were close to the prophet (pbuh) such as his wife Aisha.
Whoever or whatever you believe in, whether it be God or Allah or someone else, would not, in my opinion, support religious conflict.
The civilians in Afghanistan interact with the American soldiers quite often. That is surprising to me. I would feel conflicted. The Americans can easily be seen as invaders.
As Americans we are fortunate that we don't see war from a first-person perspective.
How does this belief make sense?
I agree with you that Christianity is best viewed as a suggestion of rules to follow. The problem I had in church was that preachers claimed that their interpretation of the Bible should be taken as a literal guide to life.
It also gave me a glimpse. What kind of people are they in Afghanistan?
I wish him the best. I also hope Sam has him in class again before the semester ends.
The video I have chosen to discuss was titled Christian Sharia in America.
I never understood how that was possible. Once I got old enough, I started to question what they were doing. I would get punished.
There are many instances of white terrorism. It is not brought up in the same way as Muslim or Islamic terrorists.
It is also a shame. Some people see a man from the Middle East. They automatically believe that they are a potential threat.
I've always heard of the training process and what needs to be done as a military. It was so sad to know that they are never taught to learn and understand the new country they are stationed at.
It made sense. He spoke about soldiers going through similar experiences. He spoke about bonding with them.
Sam does a great job. He shows his students different perspectives on an issue.
We barely speak of the civilian lives that are affected in Afghanistan.
Do not be deceived. Homosexuals may not inherit the kingdom of God.
There are many different religious books. In my opinion,
I have never been around someone who has been to Afghanistan. I have never experienced their culture first hand.
Meaning that the person back then might have had put their personal beliefs into what they wrote.
Dr. Richards' lecture brought up a difficult question. How do you rectify the hypocrisy of these documents?
We usually see this. For smaller countries, there is some foreign intervention. That is required.
Even when that same passage condemns the lives of those same people preaching the passage.
I think that the term Black Devil is harsh. That's just to say the least.
I disagree completely with what Sam was doing.
No one expects a war zone to look like an everyday, normal city.
I think this is important if they are your friends. You should at least try to learn and understand certain points of their cultures. This helps us develop the interactions with people.
Still, there are people, judges even, who read the Constitution so literally.
Sam's lectures have taught me about new ways. I think of how our world reflects on racial differences.
Kosher options are rare. They are replaced with vegetarian options. Christians always have a suitable option during lent.
Basim said he was not angry with the US. He does not hate the American people. It was our government that had dropped the bomb.
Both sides have valid arguments on speaking too little and too much.
Having Rafi come speak in our class was a once in a lifetime opportunity. It opened my eyes to what is going on in the other side of the world. It sparked my interest in learning more about Afghan culture.
I think it is super important to watch what kind of perception himself and his soldiers might give off to the civilians.
That is why I believe that neither book should try to be used to strictly crate laws for a society.
Something like this happened within our own territory. It would most likely lead to World War 3. We wouldn't be able to forgive our enemies.
People are always going to be offended by something.
It is important. War does not change the way the people are.
The past of the US was one built on racism and genocide. The past of the US is something that needs to be acknowledged publicly and ratified..
The Bible is the easiest to disprove as literal.
Because of this, I find it difficult for us to adapt ourselves and society to the culture and views based upon the writings of those times.
There is no problem with a legislator to practice their religion in their own free time. Using religion as an influence when creating new laws could be disastrous.
For instance, it is evident that societies in places such as Iran and Sudan run on Sharia Law.
These are the type of talks that are necessary to be in classrooms.
I think its a very controversial matter. I believe religion is good for people.
I don't believe that Sam was insulting towards Christianity. He wasn't even demeaning towards Christians themselves.
I enjoyed this video. It puts you in the shoes of the people who are actually there. They actually have to experience these things on a daily basis.
We saw Rafi. Anyone could notice that he is just as us, he has a family like you mentioned. It is very sad to see what him and his country are going thru.
People think that every religion is extreme except their own.
I believe that Christianity is just like any other religion. It has the potential for radicalization and hatred.
Switching roles isn't going to solve anything right away. Realization can eventually lead to a better understanding of the two sides.
He correlates a law giving people the right to practice their religion to having a strict one religion rule.
There is but one problem with religion. It is the dogmatic element.
Strong-minded people like Rafi, who are willing to lose everything to make a difference for Afghanistan should be celebrated. People like Rafi should receive the utmost support from all Americans.
People aren't always responsive to straight lectures. That's not how it needed to be presented.
It is so important that citizens of different countries converse and seek to understand one another. We are so similar in many ways. Without this realization, fear and hatred can take place..
The mall previously mentioned had been bombed.
Many people think that the sharia law is no good. It is associated with Islam. Hearing the lecture and Rafi, I understand the basics of it.
i agree Christian sharia law would not work in America
Is it the pledge process? Is it insane they are with emphasizing unity and obedience as a lesson?
I feel that you can not take a book 100 percent literally. You cannot expect to make decision and live accordingly to what its story says.
They will take out everything that agrees with their own beliefs. They will use it to justify their actions.
I think that many of us, including myself are blind to the way people living in these war zones live.
A majority of what I have heard has left me to believe that the war is fairly pointless. It would be worth saving the lives of the people currently in Afghanistan.
I had never had the chance to hear a story from someone like Basim. It has completely changed my perspective on the Middle East as a whole.
Prior to this class, I rarely considered what happened in Afghanistan.
If in fact the divorce does follow through the man loses his estate. That just seems unfair.
There is no correct way to interpret a holy book. Anyone can pick and choose what he or she believes the Bible/Quran/Torah etc.
I strongly disagree with this. A person's sexuality is something that a person is born with.
He gives a small background on what was going on in the picture. The main use of this photo was to show that not all Afghani people are bad people.
This was confirmed. LTC Garey preached that most of the locals were reasonable with their concerns.
LTC Garey shows a picture of an Afghani solider who is smiling and appears to be telling jokes with his fellow soldiers.
It's basic premise is forgiveness. It says to do right to others. It has guidelines to living everyday life.
Regarding the material in the bible. There are many things that confuse me.
North America was settled in. They mass murdered Native Americans. They put them on reservations. They forcibly converted them to Christianity.
I find this interesting. You would think that with all this power that they have, that if they ask for it they get it.
I personally do not affiliate my life according to one book. think basing your life around the teachings of wise people long ago is reasonable, perhaps close minded. That is something humanity may never get away from.
I didnt even know what Sharia law meant.
This is something I will have to look out for in the future.
I find it hard to believe that sharia law can be used in instances of the government. The quran does not cover many of the issues that government will face on a daily basis.
This viewpoint most likely comes from how media portrays war.
We automatically assume that the Afghan people are the bad guys. We just always affiliate them with war and hate.
The neighborhoods I lived in were predominately white. That all changed when I walked into school every weekday.
At the end of the video, Sam makes a really good point. He brings up Lieutenant Colonel Richard Garey.
As also mentioned in this video, many liberals are trying to bring back religious teachings into public settings in order to support certain viewpoints.
We are lucky to be living in the United States. We take safety for granted.
I like how Sam brings humor and his own personal experience into the equation. He tries to relate and get a few laughs.
These actions are often overlooked in mainstream media. Many are willing to remain complacent instead of taking action for change.
Not that I agree with abortion and divorce and those types of topics. Those issues are still up for debate.
I began to realize quickly. Afghani's are in fact very similar to American's.
I do agree with you about this. I've never taken a look at the other side of the war.
Even with everything being equal, the average employer would rather have a white man with a felony charge than a black man with a clean record, which is baffling.
Isn't that important to people? Do we just care how our own people are going through the war?
His dedication to his work is apparent. It is awesome to see someone who truly cares about people this much. He is committed to creating a positive change.
War is made up of individuals that fight in it. It is made up of individuals that live it every day.
It now is confirmed to me. The people over there are the same as us. Most want peace and to live a happy life.
I think this is very true.
We need to take away from lecture that we should be open to other perspectives. We need to not judge quickly about something we do not even know about.
In recent years, speakers with a clear religious bias have been invited to speak at our school.
There is nothing saying anything on; divorce, stalking, money laundering, cybersecurity, and more.
Religion is an effective way to organize and motivate people to do what you want.
It all depends on how we were brought up.
The fact is that both the Quran and the Bible have many different interpretations. In case we decided to turn to sharia here in the U.S. the question becomes whose interpretation should be made into law?
Although, once he was able to understand the culture, his eyes were opened to a community very similar to those in the United States.
Its just certain people who take information and use it to their advantage to come up with outrageous justifications for the crazy things they do.
The fact that these are real individuals makes the idea of war a much more complicated one. It forces us to think about it in a new way. The way we look at it now, its not personal at all. We just think of it as something that happens. but it never affects us directly.
I assume most of these groups gain followers that are already hateful of a certain group. They are told that they could use the Bible or Quran to justify the hate they already have of another group.
If all Muslims are considered terrorists because of 9/11 then how come those who claim such do not consider all Christians to be terrorists with regards to the KKK?
My grandparents are Jehovah's Witnesses. They pride themselves in living by the Bible. They would do things that contradicted the teachings of the religion. They would turn around, justifying their actions with the Bible.
I failed to imagine. Families of Afghan soldiers are going through the same hardships.
Critics tend to take certain paragraphs out of the book. They interpret them without reading the whole thing.
They did treat me and my brothers to homemade french toast, pancakes, and countless other breakfast foods. It was not really that bad.
Shit, it might even make you happier.
There was fear against U.S soldiers. Their presence meant a constant point of stress for locals.
There is no way to know. The person being welcomed may be dangerous. He may be planning to do something rude.
A bomb went off in the bus. He never made it back home to his family.
Rafi got in front of the class to speak. It hit me how real war is.
We don't go to that church anymore.
I am glad that Rafi came into the class. It reminds me that people from countries we have fought are not bad people.
The next pictures again were eye opening. The next pictures showed me the good people in these countries.
It is more a biography of Jesus's life. It's not a way to govern a civilization.
At the end of the day, we might not always believe everything that our religion tells us. How could this be the precedent for our legal system?
I feel like that is I feel a great lesson to learn is to be happy regardless, even when times are hard.
Being unable to speak your beliefs without being killed. It would not be worth living at all.
It goes to show that one group shouldn't be targeted. They live their life.
I think a lot of the time we forget that part about the war.
There is so much going on in the world outside the life we live from. Sometimes we take it for granted.
I feel like both races were somewhat victimized at times. This unfortunately only leads to more controversy on the topic.
It is so sad to me that people are so quick to make a conclusion about a religion. It is so sad people are ready to go to war without truly understanding the intent of most muslims.
I understand for a lot of people this is not the case. The activity could have been quite helpful for them.
Sam used visuals during class to show the positives of African Americans These visuals was something extremely interesting to me.
Its sad that the war has become a daily news for us. A war not a lot of us understand well.
It is simply what we are exposed to that shapes our views. Those are entirely incorrect.
I believe that, in many cases, people use religion as a explanation for their actions or beliefs, especially when being defensive.
The answer to every problem a person might face is not going to be found in these books.
Most of his time was spent conversing with the Afghan people. They discussed how they could improve their lives.
It is my feeling that religion can be a label used to protect people from having original beliefs.
People couldn't follow exactly what was written in the Bible. They would be stuck in the social structure of centuries ago. It is completely different than society today.
Religion does not given people moral compasses. People use religion as an excuse to do good/bad acts. They would have loved to have done them anyways.
The lieutenant turned down tea with the village leader numerous times. He did not realize that the village leader could only give him information in private.
Both have stories and truths that help us create a deeper understanding of morality. We must realize which ones to follow and which ones to interpret. Both pieces of work were created over a thousand years ago.
Seeing Rafi's family, friends, city really opened my eyes.
But in our modern world, it is increasingly difficult to live by such means.
Anyone can follow a religion blindly that another person has invented. It takes an individual to lead their own path.
They want their country to go back to how it was before all these other countries started coming in and destroying it.
Every friend we have was a stranger at one point.
I agree with what you said about Sam. Sam showed the map of the country.
I do and have always considered myself a real Christian.
As mentioned by Professor Richards, the Establishment Clause is a law that states that religion cannot be integrated with ideas taught in public schools, court cases, and overall the state.
A religious leader does not perform a marriage ceremony. That does not keep a person in that state from being married.
Certain actions make people seem like they are not apart of the religion because of thenorms of that religion.
Before this lecture, I had not really thought about the Afghanistan war from the perspective of the Afghan people.
For example, now days we can just text someone from very far in just matter of seconds. Back then it could take days, months or even years just to get a message. By changing this, it actually changes the whole connection we have as humans.
Do people even know what the military does?
The political directive is without feeling. It uses war. War is a way to get what they want.
This however does not mean that it should be interpreted for everything.
The fact that a man could be refused of a divorce is really quite interesting.
People in countries such as the United States are presented with these images and videos. It is easy to be manipulated into believing that all people in that country act that way.
Hearing a man who is at more risk of being attacked than myself. This made me appreciate the life I have here.
It is a collection of stories with ideas of morality and ideas of how to act in this world.
All they did was show statistics.
God created all humans. How could it possibly be fair for God to make certain people gay and then deny them the right to his kingdom?
I think a lot of people lack empathy. That is a real problem in our country.
This is seen with the most contemporary social issues, such as abortion and marriage equality.
It doesn't matter what is in any of these religious books. None of them are saying to go bring terror and death to hundreds of people simply for being different.
Because of this, I was not even baptized.
I can imagine being in his spot at the time. I'd probably think the same thing.
I realized that many of us felt a sense of guilt. We have opportunities. We live this way.
Rafi is no different than any of us. Our own government completely ruined his life.
I took a world literature class last year. Every religious book has a similar parallel.
Will it ever get to a point of peace?
Christian radicals follow many aspects of their religion to the very word. Christian radicals ignore or drastically misinterpret another part in order to suit their world views.
We could have done something similar without diving into controversies. We could have stayed away from things of that sort.
Seeing the picture off traffic was really eye opening. It made it seem like a normal place.
It takes a lot of effort to see what's right verses what's wrong. It takes more effort to decide.
I remember this lecture being one of the most mentally enlightening.
Although I do not personally condone U.S. involvement in the middle east, I do believe that we should show more empathy for foreign nations as we proceed with dealing with foreign affairs.
What have I observed in America? There is a very skewed perspective about Afghanistan and the people from there.
Some countries have confronted their issues. South Africa is one.
I was impacted by seeing that a lot of Afghanistan civilization is not what I pictured. They are just like us. They are trying to live a peaceful healthy life.
With no clear way. Enforcing a holy book's writing into law. It would be difficult. To ever agree on what should be done.
Currently, I do not attend church on a regular basis.
He continues on to get another part of the Bible. It describes multiple different ways that a person cannot be allowed into heaven.
War is an unnecessary evil in today's society. War is such a large factor in our lives that it will continue to be talked about. We need to change how we discuss war. We should move our focus on  the human aspect of war.
I totally had the same exact thoughts reading your response to this part of the lecture.
t is insane that people believe that societies means of living should be determined by ideas that were created over one thousand years ago.
So how can I live my life now days accordingly to the beliefs and views of what is the right thing or wrong thing to do? All these factors need to be taken into consideration in order for me to decide what is an acceptable and correct way of living my life.
This is very similar to radical Islam. Members will commit terrorism or hate in the name of god.
They thought they were saving them. They destroyed Native American culture.
I was always taught to forgive, love, and understand.
I like the reference you made to the U.S. constitution. The U.S. constitution was written with the ability to be changed to adapt to the times.
He even brings up a similar slide with information in the Quran. Alcoholics and gamblers will not inherit the kingdom of God.
In general, I consider myself to be someone who is culturally aware. I'm someone who respects diversity.
I think the point of this video was to show civilians that soldiers go through things that can and will change them for the rest of their lives. They are overseas there is limited time they are actually at battle.
I think, when it comes to reading books like the Bible and Quran, you have to look at them like historical texts more than instructional texts. People once followed them. You have to try to get the big picture of what they are trying to teach.
Maziar was a former member of the Iranian military. He was friendly with two former members of the US military. It is hard to believe that there is still so much hate between the two countries.
Hearing people like that truly disgust me.
Trump uses Christianity to form his opinions. Sam does mention that half of what Trump does is not acceptable under the rules of the Bible.
People can look at it and find hatred. If you give a more modern look on the Bible, you will see that it is more about acceptance. It is about not judging others.
However, to see that an American soldier who enters a town actually gets to sit down with one of the most knowledgeable people in their community is nothing short of amazing.
And why is it interpreted in various, extremely contrasting ways?
People who enjoy gambling sometimes should not be crucified. This is assuming that they are smart about it.
I feel like as Americans we feel very estranged from Afghanistan and other countries. Our soldiers are in countries.
To go along with this quote, the bible also states that there is only one criterion that God uses to judge humans.
It was incredibly disheartening to hear about the effects of the U.S. involvement in the Middle East.
I think it is really interesting to see war from someones perspective that experiences it every day. Someone who lives a life in threat.
It's just how Sam mentions in the discussion. Everyone interprets the workings of the Bible differently.
And as soon as I heard Rafi speak about his wife and his children, and when Bassim told the class about that horrible incident, I was mad at myself.
He originally wondered if the action was from malicious intent. It was soon clear that this was an act of kindness. This was even though Garey was a stranger.
Ordinary citizens have no interest in the politics of war. Often no one cares about the loss.
I'm at least grateful that we talk about the topic at all.
The civilians are the ones who are truly affected by any war. But I was happy for Rafi. He was still a positive person who could share his story.
They interview soldiers who fought in Afghanistan. It shows how surprised, how generous and welcoming the people are.
I thought his was a really interesting approach to viewing race. I was interested in the science behind it.
Hearing that Bassim wasn't angry was astounding.
I found LTC Garey's discussion very interesting. The stories he told were amazing.
Sam Richards also spoke upon the verse. Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit? They have any share in the kingdom of God.
The bible touches on a couple of these topics briefly. The bible does not go into vivid detail
They call it unprogressive. They are very strict about some crimes like stealing. They cut the hand.
The media never did one-on-one interviews. One-on-one interviews would really get you in the shoes of the people that lived there.
I was honored to have Garey speak in our lecture. He gave us insight on what it is like to work with the Afghan people.
Some took the book and turned it into an article of war and hatred. They used it to control and direct the illiterate and disenfranchised. This is seen in groups like ISIS.
The media portrays them awfully. The media makes them out to be monstrous people who's only instinct is to act on violence.
Were not to be eaten.
I would have never imagined a Lieutenant having tea with an old man in a small village to get the information they needed.
The only difference is that ISIS is killing Christians.
I even began to grow in my faith as I grew older. I was still never completely sure how to understand all of it.
Look at the entire verse. It seems obvious. Most people in the country will not inherit the kingdom of God.
He would and has questioned those people on both sides with who are you to tell them they arent Christians/Muslims.
You mentioned in this about peoples identity as religious based on what they are surrounded with. This is something I find to be very interesting.
We have this mindset that its our job to get involved in any foreign relations that has to do with us. It may be something we dearly want.
Many places in Afghanistan look like that.
Generalizing groups of people is very ignorant and uneducated.
They were looking for something to support their thought process. They somehow found it.
I think the idea of Sharia can be applied to any religion or any belief set. That was what Sam was trying to teach us.
That being said, many do not have the same interpretations of either book.
Americans seem to have this prejudice against Afghani people. They believe that they are bad people who are just trying to cause wars along with perform terrorist acts.
Most of the time the priest would explain the idea to the congregation. One can take the laws practically. It's more important to take the message beyond it's face value.
I really agree with you what you are saying here, I agree with.
I find it crazy. He says he misses it over there.
This is done all around the world. Within each different religion. Each religion is not really that different.
Before that day in class, I had still seen Afghanistan as a poor country. It was more like a war zone than a place. People carry out their everyday lives.
It is common. It happens within the same states but different regions. This is similar to people who are from New York.
I know exactly what you mean. Trying to decipher how to live your life off of ancient books is super confusing. No one is ever going to interpret it exactly the same.
I think interpretation is where most people get religions twisted.
The only differences are several tweaks, the characters. There is the culture that it supported at the time.
if we do this it will help alleviate some of those common misconceptions that are seen.
Sam unpacks this assumption by bringing out a Quran, which is the so-called basis for Sharia law. He describes what the Quran actually is
He states that he got to know the people who lived there. He built a connection with them. It taught him that they are people, too.
We have total disagreement due to religion. That will not be beneficial. We try to run a country. We keep the peace within the country.
I also believe that as interpreters of the Bible, we get tripped up on some of the details. This happens instead of seeing the larger picture.
He got the information he was looking for. The information helped the village.
Well traveled civilians usually have a good sense of other cultures.
It was even more interesting to hear about just how similar that the Muslim faith is to Christianity,
We, being Americans, haven't had to deal with war going on in our own backyard.
Many people suffer. They are affected by war. This cannot continue to be unnoticed.
The different interpretations from different people would cause more problems than it would fix. Thus to live by the teaching in the book would be fine. Governing by them is something that wouldn't seem to work.
I am a nineteen year old girl. I know little to nothing about war.
Sam said knuckleheads.
In overlying major issues I think it is smart to fall back on the bible. We realize what is actually right and wrong.
It is common of us to feel mostly safe in our neighborhood area. It is hard to understand how someone in another country could feel the total opposite.
They are successful. They have an ability to engage with other people of other cultures.
Speaking with Bassim really made war real. We all learned about another countries viewpoint on the US.
I really like how you worded it. I couldn't agree more.
I agree with some things the Bible states. I disagree with a number of beliefs it states.
Both religions have the challenge to relate them to current day issues.
We already know White Supremacy is a thing.
The answer varies. People put more meaning to religion than it would be expected.
It is hard to believe the incredible amount of poverty there is in the United States because it is hidden from us.
It's just like any other religious book. The Quran has basic common sense rules to follow. Those make sense to correlate with laws.
It doesn't matter how much we try. We change the system of racial hierarchy. It will truly never be broken.
When the word Afghanistan is mentioned, it provokes images of violent people with bombs strapped to their chest trying to kill Americans.
There were many facets to the bible. Things that I didn't agree with. Facets interpreted far differently than what I was being told.
This is a perspective. It rapidly grew post 9/11.
The world we live in is not the same. Those texts were written thousands of years ago.
Its really fascinating to learn about the rules and regulations in other religions Im not familiar with. It is fascination to learn a little bit about the Quran really makes you realize how some Christians demonize Islam.
White people do not understand the reality that black people have to face everyday. By reversing the roles of the white person vs. the black person, it gave me a better understanding of the continuous struggle that people of color still face today.
I come from a regular suburban town. I live in a bubble. My only concept of war is the fact that my grandfather fought in World War II. We seem to always be at war.
Many people do not realize the damage it does to people.
I do not understand how their worlds view can be so focused in one part of the book. They should consider the whole thing.
It is difficult to realize. Christians misinterpret the Bible often, just like Muslims do.
Because of the size of the Quran. It is impossible for it to contain a guideline for dealing with every type of potential crimes.
I found this whole conversation very interesting. I grew up knowing that we were in war with them. They have hurt a lot of good people.
I am so grateful for Basim. He takes the time out of his day. He speaks to our class.
Morality differs from person to person and their interpretations. When one person reads a passage they may interpret it entirely differently from another. How do you form a government based solely on the Quran or even the Bible?
The statistics may just seem like numbers on a graph or charts. They are real people with lives and livelihood. They are suffering because of fighting.
I found this segment to be very interesting. I am a Christian myself.
One video I thought to be exceptionally interesting. It was the one about the Establishment Clause.
A few individuals inside a car thought that it was religiously correct to run over a group of protesters in the street.
Basically what Sam was talking about was how people would like to bring Christian Sharia law to America. He highlights the flaw in this.
I love how this class is constantly giving me reasons to challenge my beliefs. It gets me thinking about new ones.
I, too, had only ever been taught values of love, peace, and acceptance.
By forcing someone to perform a marriage ceremony that conflicts with their views is not fair to that person who has dedicated their life to what they believe. It is not fair whether or not we agree with it.
How could we possibly know what God truly meant?
It  does not make sense to me. Why would you ask a religious leader to perform your marriage ceremony? He/she was against your views. They would not do it willingly.
Sam made the comparison with the Christian religion and Muslim religion to show that the books are morally the same.
Jesus is described as a simple, but magical man. He has the power of God. He lives humbly as a peasant. He wanders across the land spreading his message.
I was clearly misinformed of was the actual meaning of Sharia Law.
We do not always realize that Afghanis are real people too and a lot like us in many ways.
I frequently get asked if I am religious.
Many of the aspects are touched on in the Old Testament. It was to a lesser extent.
How can you call a group of people sinners for being born with something? They cannot change.
Hearing many of Rafis stories was extremely eye opening for me. It's because I never really thought of the real people living in war zones.
Hearing Rafi talk about his life in Afghanistan, his children, his work is really eye opening to me.
It provides opportunities to learn and gain perspectives from a wide range of people with unique backgrounds and cultures.
I get the idea of this exercise. I am somewhat confused by it.
That goes for everything life. Just because this sharia law is in another country we shouldn't listen to what others have to say about it. We can let go of prejudices and see what its all about for ourselves.
No one wants to feel stupid.
How there are so many good people in that part of the world. All we see is the complete opposite.
The growing issue of civilians being affected. It is very apparent in Afghanistan.
I feel as if people in the United States should be getting divorced less. They should try to make their marriages work more than they do.
That is the case. How did people just make their own way to follow it? People think that was ok.
I think that some people just use it as an excuse so they can do horrific things. MakeS them feel as though they are doing the right thing. It is just despicable.
I always thought of traveling as going to pretty places.
People are not informed on situations like this. They put innocent people in danger.
The line just becomes blurred. It has a name you associate with yourself on it.
I reacted negatively to those things before I actually heard the full laws. This is the exact kind of bias that Sam wanted to make us aware of.
There is a lot of power in knowing about other religions and cultures that you are not accustomed to. Walls and barriers begin to be tore down when you can relate to a person from their standpoint. When we figure out why they are doing something you are not familiar with.
I firmly believe that nobody truly knows what happens when we pass away. To prosecute others and discriminate against people who share different beliefs than you is just ridiculous.
She told me that I shouldn't tell people that I'm Arabic or Muslim. She was so afraid of the Islamophobia going on.
This exercise really showed how physical characteristics are simply a product of your environment. Physical characteristics depend on geography.
The fact that many Americans often associate all Muslims with extreme terrorism is completely unfair.
It really sucks. People that are just like us have to live in this constant state of fear everyday.
Personally, this has never really been a big issue in my life.
It is really hard to imagine living my own life in constant fear.
It was in another discussion. Sam put up a verse from the bible. It basically said those who are homosexuals will not go to heaven.
I believe it comes down to personal preferences. We like people for the little things that we ourselves may not even be aware of.
I think in order to understand another country we have to experience what they go through. It's really easy to judge from the outside. We don't really know what's going on in the inside.
I used to think like the rest of the public that the Afghan people are always in wars. The image of them in public has nothing to do with peace.
Poor/ young children who did not get to experience a proper childhood get murdered.
Not only did it cause me to appreciate the fact that this war isn't happening on our own land. It made me empathize with the innocent people who are dying from this stupid war.
I thought about it if it was applied to the United States. I thought about if a group such as the KKK was to attempt to try to follow this example.
The next picture he showed us was the shopping center in Kabul. It was bombed.
They believe that in order to be more committed to their religion they have to take actions full of atrocity.
It is so scary and upsetting to see the images of these little girls. We know that they are living in the middle of war. They must be terrified.
Thus, I truly wish society would stop placing false assumptions on groups of people before learning about their way of life.
I'm sure many of the Christians who don't believe in homosexuality have performed sexual acts before marriage or drank or smoked. All they can focus on is what doesn't apply to them.
LTC Garey even stated, Most of the times I was working with the opposing side!
They should be recognized.
I never thought it would be important. I know about the opposing side's culture or different types of recruiting tactics. Listening to Rich, it is clear. This is an important part of the job.
It is often that we stereotype the people of a country involved in war.
I was taught to turn to the Bible. It answers more difficult questions.
LTC Garey began his story by saying he had his unit had been searching for a high up Taliban member for quite awhile. LTC Garey had been unable to locate him.
It made me see how similar they are. the only reason they viewed as being completely different is the public perspective on how people interpret them.
The Afghan people are welcoming/ peaceful people. They are misrepresented in our world.
Prosperity should not be limited to citizens of a certain skin color. This principle is at the foundation of this country. The institution fails to uphold its promises.
However, it is not their fault. They did not have a specific set of rules to follow.
Another thing he showed us was a graph. We could see that each year there are more Afghan civilians that die because of the war.
I agree. Sam showed us pictures of real people there and told us their story. My whole perspective changed.
I came out of this class however seeing a striking similarity in Rafis talk and Bassims talk.
I thought this clip was interesting. I personally was unaware of the specifics of the Establishment Clause.
One person might consider themselves a servant of god. Another person might only go to church on Christmas.
To this day, I remember him telling me a story. He would lay awake at night unable to comprehend the horror he saw. He could hear numerous men crying softly in their bunks.
Seeing him live on the screen left me speech less.
Innocent civilians over there die. It is often not heard of.
I was more than once that I was amazed by how people have one view of something and wouldnt even consider taking a second look from another angle.
Afghan people are just humans like we are. People fail to understand that due to the fact that all they hear is negative comments when they are growing up.
The war affected people physically. Civilians also started experiencing mental and psychological problems. This was due to the horrific experiences and heartaches they had to go through daily.
He tells us. They are real people living in Afghanistan. The war is going on.
Have you heard about the Dead See Scrolls?
I also found it very interesting. He broke down the literal sense of the Bible's verses. They state who will not go to heaven.
I believe what you said. It is unfortunate that upon the arrival of the US in Afghanistan, the people had a hazy idea about what Afghanistan really is. That included some of the troops that had to go there.
It is safe to say that religion has caused more wars and deaths than any other issue.
I feel I am more accepting unlike my grandparents.
We as Americans don't realize this. There are people out there living their lives just like us.
I know I am only preaching here. It is true.
I thought it was fascinating to compare Christianity and Islam. It was even more amazing to point out radicals. In both religions they are not truly following what the text is saying. They are just picking and choosing what they want to follow.
The honest truth is that one person cannot live their entire life trying to follow the writing of somebody else. The book cannot possibly provide advice for every little aspect on a person's life.
To lose your wife, your kid, your brother, even your dog, in one fatal day! The heartbreak is hard to imagine.
Abortions, womens rights, these are areas. People continue to disagree.
I used to live abroad. With that I have encountered many different cultures. I unfortunately pictured Afghanistan as a war-torn desert with little civilization.
Rafis friend was murdered for doing work. It was much like Rafi's. It was work that promotes peace in Afghanistan.
It is kind of embarrassing when you think about it.
Politics and the Christian religion are perceived as tightly intertwined. Observed from the outside.
Love takes many different forms. I support every one.
That is why is so important for not only us, as students of this class to open our eyes but society in general.
All I think about is violence. That's because that is what I was taught growing up.
With that being said, I have always wanted more insight into what they truly do. Not just when they join, but specifically overseas.
It's sad that his daughters have to grow up living in a war zone.
I also thought it was different. There were four types of divorce that Rafid talked about.
I completely agree with Colonel Richard. We easily assume that the people living in conflict zones are always prepared to fight. We assume people living in conflict ones are carrying weapons. We assume people living in conflict zones are illiterate, poor and knowing only war. because then we can justify it.
It's something we discussed at length during lab the past two weeks as well.
I totally agree. I did not have a very good understanding of Middle Eastern culture.
I thought that soldiers did what they had to do in combat. That was it!
We are all humans. I believe that we should stop putting labels on those people just because of their ethnicity.
The war is displayed in our news a certain way. It makes it seem like we are hated by the civilians.
I think that there are a couple reasons society has this perception.
What is the point of trying to make peace? There is always going to be more wars?
I personally have never read the bible even though I'm a Christian. I never knew that the statement that gay people won't go to heaven is also included in the same sentence as thieves, fornicators, drunkards, extortioners, and sodomites won't get into heaven either.
Does interpreting text differently really matter when claiming your religion?
Sam showed us a graph. It counted the number of military personnel deaths. It compared U.S. workers versus Afghan workers.
She was afraid of people mistreating me. She was mistreated following 9/11.
Who wants to watch the news and listen about how many people are killed every day?
Again, I was wrong. Christians and Muslims do believe in a lot of the same things.
We might not be able to stop the war alone. Together, it may be possible.
We should have a strong ambition to give every person a chance. We should genuinely accept how others live everywhere.
Being an atheist there is now way I would be able to live my life and follow my ethics by the words of the bible.
I think a lot of it has to do with how our media portrays the war and Afghanistan in particular.
There are radicals everywhere. To assume that the majority of a faith follows the same beliefs as them would be wrong.
I think that in some situations race is brought up excessively. It's not enough at the same time sometimes.
In this class I noticed something. Maybe Americans do talk about race more than other countries.
Overall, I think the biggest thing to take away from this video is that people today will use certain hate groups. They use them to represent a certain religion in entirety.
What I took most out of this lecture is thatdespite how foreign so many places around the world may seem compared to the United States, the people are just like us.
I don't know. I'd offer a military personal to tea. They were part of the reason friends and family are being killed as war casualties.
This is also where radical Christians make their claims. Radical Muslims do the same with the Koran.
I say this. Deep down inside of myself I really feel like I am a Christian. I enjoy the Christian faith.
Both have the same ideas. They are interpreted by each religion in completely different ways.
This is genuinely upsetting. I do not know what it will take to put an end to all of this.
I think this thought process is false. It should not be used in modern society.
This then allows them to make larger strides while there. They are not just fighting physically but mentally as well.
I find it very hard to talk to them about religion. Tthe one thing I've learned is that everything they believe in isn't going to change anytime soon.
I agree. I think it's not only America. It's any human being.
He also referenced his religion playing a role in his life after the accident. He was saying how he practices forgiveness and exiling hate.
On top of all this the people of Afghanistan have to deal with ISIS. That's why Rafi is an incredible human being.
We think in that manner. It is okay for us not to care.
Radical Islamism in this way can be a convenient evil to piece together for American Christians. Muslims worship a religion built on the literal word of God. It is clear how radical activists could spread. Radical activists can be seen as misguided people with an evil and unchanging idea.
The bible has multiple stories and teachings. They can be left up to interpretation.
There are so many kind and innocent people. They aren't shown because the media controls what is aired.
Learning a foreign language is an amazing experience.
Overall, Rich's passion for what he did for so long was inspiring.
This lecture really drew my attention to the way Christianity has dominance in America.
I made uneducated assumptions. This is how the majority of Muslims behaved. Those were their beliefs.
Without differences, we would be sheltered. We would not be able to survive in the real world.
He is essentially fighting the Taliban. They rule over villages. They impose Sharia law on the Afghani people.
They could be thinking to step up their efforts. Maybe if they were violent enough, they would be heard out.
As a society, we have to grow to become more accepting and welcoming. I think in certain situations, religious beliefs can cause quite a divide.
When he stated this it really caught my eye. Many citizens, even myself, forget that these soldiers are people just like us.
Shouldn't we be allowed to express ourselves the way we want to?
Sharia Law is generally seen as a negative thing in our society especially by politicians.
War affects real people. It ruins real places and devastates real families.
The name of this video was, War Affects Real People. Sam definitely made this clear throughout this video and class.
There is a lack of understanding of the Afghan culture. It has delayed the rescue of the village.
I think it's really inspiring. Muslim and Afghan people can overlook the hate. They don't let it consume them.
We should all try to learn and understand each other. There will not be as much conflict going on in the world.
He showed pictures of different places in Afghanistan. It may be a poor, war torn country. It doesn't mean the civilians mean any less than they do anywhere else.
It is not seen. The war in Afghanistan and other events overshadow them.
From the media's point of view this is only seen as a good thing. They hide the fact that civilian death rate in Afghanistan is continuously rising.
I also thought it was interesting that in the Muslim laws, spouses need a reason for divorce. one of these reasons involved not loving their spouse anymore. None of these reasons involved having feelings for someone else.
We are so blind to what is really going on over there. We forget to separate the civilians from the issue at hand.
I have experienced the different questions people can ask about the religion. I experienced the hate that comes along with it.
I believe divorce rate will continue to rise throughout history. Our lifespans increase.
Being American, we tend to not think about what is going on in the rest of the world.
Violence is accelerating at an all time high.
I had always assumed other religions preached different moral and ethical values than that of Christianity. It was interesting to me to see that they are not all that different.
Radical Christianity is talked about much less. Radical Christianity happens every day in this country.
I personally believe that using the Bible or the Quran as a basis for your life and the decisions you make is OK. Grasping for information or interpretations that aren't there is not OK.
Rafi's children are being raised directly in a war zone.
It takes a class that nearly has 800 students and makes it smaller. It encourages discussion among one another in the best way.
I think of reasons in part. Its difficult for Americans to realize the reality of what life is like in Afghanistan. Americans never see what their day-to-day life is like in the media.
The pictures Sam showed of Afghanistan helped to show this. It is an average place, with normal people. It is just like America. I've never thought about that.
Both religions have had their share of fights and killings. It is very devastating.
What drives you to do what you do?
I feel that the internet is causing us to unfairly generalize groups of people in both religion and race.
After knowing about Dylann Roof and how he went into a church and shot people, how is it that people have the audacity to denounce other peoples beliefs?
Some christians or muslims only read the things they want to read. there are not many people going to heaven.
The media has a large role in the way that the Muslim religion is portrayed in America.
I feel like this really fits into what Sam talked about in class.
Some got used to the conditions. They believe that they are being protected that way.
A reporter went to a sort of rally that was happening. The guy giving the speech was translating the Quran.
We see an article about immigrants coming to the US. Some people will then view them as freeloaders.
I also agree. The Bible cannot explain everything about the world to us.
I feel like it is time. We should see something other than people with guns terrorizing.
Thousands of civilians lose their lives. However, most of them remain hopeful. They are faithful that prosperity, that freedom will return to their country.
Justine, I felt the same exact way as you did. Coming into this lecture when this discussion. And, then when I left the classroom.
People do not feel that sodomy or fornication are such drastic sins. They are more regular.
Acts like fornication, thievery, drunkenness, and others were considered not right by the bible.
I was also so inspired by Basim. It was in the way that he overcame his anger. He does not blame the United States.
I am going to talk about the video The Importance of the Military to Know Other Cultures today.
You mentioned it. They are real people.
I am nineteen years old. I have never been on a plane.
I am like the majority of my fellow Americans. I only associate Afghanistan with fighting.
I was taken back by Sam's comparison of Sharia Law to the Old Testament. It showed how ridiculous the idea of using a holy book for a set of modern day laws today.
Even if it were more recent you cant possibly hope to contain that much guidance and information in a single book.
I then took it to a smaller scale. I began thinking about just random places I have visited recently.
You cannot have any expectation of safety.
Nevertheless, Christians across the world still believe in the legitimacy of our religion. Christians across the world become defensive when people speak ill of our belief system.
It was extremely heartwarming to listen to the gentlemen from the army speak. He spoke  about his experiences with the Afghan people.
We have Rafi and LTC Garey in class to speak. It did help with achieving that goal. I am thankful we were given that opportunity.
I was drawn to this video over other. I found it interesting just how similar the Quran and Bible are.
There clearly is still racism today. Our generation should be putting a stop to the racist talk and teach equality to the future of America.
I have only heard of Sharia Law being associated with Islamic faith. It is the understandings that guide one on the path to heaven. It can be very traditional. It includes harsh punishments in order to establish law in our system.
I understand that war is much more complex. That makes it that much more important to start educating in school on these topics.
My answer to your question is simple. I am not worried about the increase of biracial couples.
One thing you said about all the presidents being the same religion. It is actually pretty interesting. I thought about that myself quite a bit.
I do not know if personally I would have the courage. I am put in the same situation as him.
This is something the TV news channels and newspapers do not report.
It is up to us to look further into what we see on the newstand. The people of Afghanistan, amongst other places, are just normal people.
Religion classes strayed from the typical lecture format. They focused on student-centered discussions. My peers and I were encouraged to question and criticize fundamental Catholic doctrine.
I just think that it's very hypocritical that people take certain parts of the bible that correspond with their beliefs and preach them. People fail to take into account other parts that they're guilty of doing as well.
I was shocked that the one student did meet all the requirements.
Overall, I found your response to be super insightful.
I think it is better for myself. I am now aware of the teachings of the Sharia Law. This way if people look on this negatively. I can defend it and say. how is it actually different than Christianity?
It's been sixteen years the United States has been fighting in this war.
Sharia to me is this code of conduct. Through open interpretation and adaptation, it can make followers negatively adherent.
I had never pictured someone from Afghanistan(especially a woman) who could look and dress just like me. All these people have hopes and dreams and they really are no different from you and me.
Thinking in that mentality it was powerful to consider. Powerful how much reasoning one book could have on  our lives. Powerful how much control one book could have on our lives.
I always find it amazing how similar the two religions are. People think the two religions are very different from one another.
Sam said that Rafi regularly gets death threats. Rafi was told to get an armed guard. It really made me upset.
Maybe people think that race is talked about too much. Too often in the news, we see stories of racism and hatred.
I think presenting it this way was very interesting.
We as a country need to educate ourselves on different peoples of the world.
How do we know someone did not just make it up for how they felt we should be living.
When I think about Afghanistan, I think of conflict and fighting. There has been a war going on for almost two decades.
In the United States, there are many rules, many regulations. All people living here are expected to uphold them. Many religions also have rules, regulations. To be a good follower, we are expected to uphold them, additionally.
The overall population hates the war. They want it to end in order to provide safer lives for themselves, families, and children.
For myself, I always pictured them as being a little violent given the fact that they are a country who has been in war for a long time.
Everytime I walk out of this class, I realize how ignorant I am.
It is an interesting tactic. I did not know soldiers did and to me it makes doing what they do a lot more fascinating. It is not just about combat and violence like it is portrayed.
I'm sure a large part of it is how her parents act around her. I wonder how being exposed to more of these issues might start to change her mind.
I think Hollywood also plays a role in this misconception. We often have misconceptions about war, especially this specific war.
What he is doing is not only appreciable. It's astonishing in a way on top of that.
There are broad similarities. I never noticed the subtler ones. Sam brought them to light during class.
I think the instinct is to be nervous about women being trapped in their marriages. If the state of your marriage has to fulfill a prescribed set of issues for the divorce to be legitimate, I wonder if that ever makes couples stay together that would otherwise get divorced in America, and perhaps settle their differences?
Civilians have it engraved in their mind. Soldiers just fight, fight, fight until the end of combat.
Also like you said, Hollywood definitely shows a horrible picture for Afghan. It's people.
I was raised in a Christian family. I had heard the passage before.
Our lovely government prints Christian sentiments on everything from money to historical documents. "In God We Trust" has become the official motto of the United States.
Everyone was raised differently, has different beliefs and cultures. It's understandable that everyone is not going to agree with one another or even understand each others cultures.
Of course, the school said absolutely not. They did not want to favor them over other students.
The media fails to show the most beautiful parts of this country.
The choice of ending your response with a question was very powerful. It made me think.
I chose this video. I thought it was amazing.
I agree with you when you talked about how we have this preconceived notion that soldiers travel to our enemys nation and experience conflict. They come back unstable. That is what many movies make us believe.
We should receive news about the families that are there. They want nothing to do with war.
We tend to avoid and ignore harsh realities. We just focus on our own.
No they are never going to get used to such a life. They dont support it but that has become their lives.
It is unheard of in the United States to invite random people into your home and prepare them food and tea.
I find myself questioning. If the way I interpret the Bible is the correct way.
In my opinion It can be hard to humanize a man with a gun on his hip. You see the lives of people just like you dying around you.
Both of them were very well spoken. Hayden especially left me with a different opinion on race and sports.
People who have different lives and maybe even people who have experienced a war like environment.
I am also Christian. I found it really interesting how closely our beliefs and values really are.
This makes me realize how incredibly lucky I am.
No one ever really gets to hear how the people living there are affected by what is going on.
I think more people should be able to have this conversation with any solider. It will help to  know what is really happening when soldiers travel to other countries.
It is a way to deteriorate certain subcultures.
I agree. People should not be afraid of new ideas. In particular, those that challenge ones own beliefs.
There are gray areas of the Bible. They cause these grievances to take place.
The way you interpreted this segment of class was interesting. It is amazing how we have this idea of what war is. Hearing this side from a solider is incredible.
As a Jew, I have never read the bible. had an idea from my experiences in life and people who I have been friends with that the bible was a book of teaching from God. Bible told us how to live our lives in order to reach heaven and get back to God and Jesus.
Their views are unacceptable now. I continue to sometimes fight with my grandma about this.
He even talks about how he got suspicious. The village elder offered him tea, making him suspicious.
I would be so afraid to be always living in danger.
There will always be those who are uneducated, poor, or both. They find a sense of purpose in becoming radicalized.
I think the picture really emphasized the whole point of the class's lecture. They are real people with families, hopes, and dreams.
Kristine, I totally agree with what you are saying about the war.
Not every Mexican sell drugs or eats beans.
I also found LTC Garey's story about the village elder inviting him in for tea very interesting.
It's especially true in Western culture. We are very open to more stuff. These books would probably consider them sinful.
My parents are very traditional. We tend to have debates over current issues. These include race, LGBTQ, or the afterlife.
The bombings in his country have significantly impacted his life. They are extremely difficult to talk about.
His family was murdered. I could cry just thinking about it.
The soldier recounted the first time he went to Afghanistan to eliminate the Taliban. I saw how detrimental and even stressful the lack of understanding a persons culture can be.
We are having more interracial families. We are becoming a more open accepting society.
I took  required classes such as World Religions and Hebrew Scriptures. My worldview widened. I contrasted elements of different faiths against my personal beliefs.
Throughout my time at church, it was always apparent that religions differed. People from many different religions thought differently.
This gives me a sense of humanity towards the people of Afghanistan. This makes me wonder why we continue to use force against people of Afghanistan. We should be trying to create stronger ties with the people of Afghanistan
Whenever someone doesn't agree with a certain opinion it doesn't matter. It's beneficial to be exposed to differing perspectives.
Here in America we can live peacefully. We don't have to think about anything that goes on anywhere else.
I rarely ever think about the innocent civilians. They live in fear and danger every day.
I thought this lecture was eye opening. It really put things into perspective.
However, there are a lot of aspects about the Christian religion that I really do not agree with. It is hard for me to accept some of the principles of the Bible.
Who says that one person or one group of people can determine the correct way to follow these ideals?
Sam asked the class what came to mind when we would think about people from Afghanistan. The majority of the class had the wrong idea about them and their culture.
This was particularly evident when it comes to white peoples ability to give black people equal opportunity as white people.
Many more people would care about ending the war in the Middle East. They need to understand the affect it is having on the people who live there.
I heard the  Colonel talk about his time in Afghan. I heard the  Colonel talk about living with the people in Afghan. Everything that happened in that class was a true representation of who the Afghan people are.
It is easy to put different groups of people into little boxes. That's all we think.
Our generation is debatably too comfortable with the war going on there.
By flipping the participants races the flaws and redundancy in each argument become more obvious.
Rafi is doing a completely selfless act. He's looking out for what he thinks will lead to a better future for his country and his family.
Things like this never get brought up in the media today.
I do not believe in a right way to do anything.
I agree 100% with what you said.
So many questions unanswered. No possible way of putting down a definitive argument using solely contextual evidence.
I believe that it is of upmost importance that we begin to recognize the people of Afghanistan as humans. This will better educate ourselves on the goings on of the world outside our own country. This will cure this ignorance which we all seem to be suffering from
I've never been around someone who looked Muslim that made me feel uncomfortable.
The war continued destroying lives in Afghanistan. It has caused economic, financial and social losses for everyone around the country.
I really enjoyed how Sam began class. He gave us the background of how the two formed a friendship.
I realize now. Those people do not hate. They do not want to fight.
It goes to show the image we have of the world.
There is a military man who had been on multiple tours and a native Afganistan person.
Innocent Afghans and American soldiers dying because of this war Afghan kids and families are dying.
Its crazy! How can he  have so much positivity and acceptance towards what happened to him?
Taliban members do so much harm. It is shocking to see that they can be caring about LTC Garey and his family  It is shocking for them not to lash out in the face of the enemy.
I knew you had to wait some time. I just didn't think it was only a couple years.
An example is the antisemites who march with confederate flags holding tiki torches.
We get trapped inside of a bubble. We forget about the rest of the world.
We had two gentlemen, Rich and Raffi, come to our class. They discussed what life is like on a daily basis in Afghanistan and answer questions about their time there.
I think that it is sad. Lieutenant Colonel Gary had to explain. Lieutenant Colonel Gary had to give examples to support. The people of Afghanistan are so similar to the people here in the United States.
There is an abundance of poverty in America. As Americans, we focus on those who are wealthy.
It really makes me appreciate living in America. I am able to feel safe most of the time. I am happy with where I live.
I saw pictures of cars in a traffic jam. I saw a shopping mall with a beautiful interior. It clearly was not what I was expecting whatsoever.
Overall, your point regarding stopping right winged terrorism rather than just stopping islamic terrorism is something that needs to be considered by the administration.
I really like what you had to say.
Sam brought Rafi in to talk to us. Rafi talked about his personal life. He talked about living his life through this stress.
It ended up that our trip had to be ended 3 days early. Nonetheless, I will never forget my experience in Israel.
I pray that Rafi and other Afghans don't lose hope regarding peace.
I would be interested to know what the divorce rate is in Muslim countries. I would like to see how it compares to the shockingly high rate in the US.
It's as Lieutenant Colonel Gary said. They wake up, go to work, come home and eat as a family, etc.
It was during a different discussion with Bassim. I  felt extremely impacted by the conversation we had with Bassim.
People are liking each other's tweets. People agree with their classmates. People are just posting some constructive criticism of an opinion. The engagement in our lectures is off the charts.
I know sometimes, I tend to forget that the news can sometimes be biased. That there are other things going on in a country other than what we are exposed to.
These people were my neighbors, classmates, teammates, and mostly importantly my friends. I think it's so important. Everyone realizes that the people committing these heinous terrorist attacks aren't Muslims, They are terrorists.
Soldiers have to interact with other people who are not the opposing soldiers. This emphasizes the fact that being in the army is not only about the violence.
In my opinion, I do not think they would receive the same amount of support.
I know that in my family, my parents go to work every day. Their jobs are not life and death related.
We are supposed to read about Jesus' teachings. We are supposed to loosely model our lives according to Jesus' compassion.
I knew before that class that everyone, no matter where they are located, no matter what they are going through, is a human being.
I had another thought when reading your post. It's that race isn't talked about enough, but racism is.
There is no true fact that says straight up that he meant to say this or that. It is all based on interpretation.
As college students, we are supposed to be the educated youth.
This is what stuck out to me the most when sitting in on this class. The Colonel talked about how welcoming the civilians of Afghan were to him.
I would like to experience and learn about the many different parts of the world. I have yet to visit many countries.
It honestly comes down to how someone interprets their religion.
This is what makes humans so unique. The great diversity that we have.
It is truly terrifying to think about what it would take. It could happen quickly. A radical group of Christians in the US could turn into basically a terrorist organization. They could start killing people in order to get their way.
I really agree with what you were saying in this response.
We should put more effort into discovering the whole truth. We should discover more than just the snippets that we hear on the news.
I feel like, currently, it has been a bigger issue.
Hate groups do not and will (most likely) never have as much authority in America as they do in the Middle East. If they did, we could find ourselves in a very similar quality of life.
We learned that both civilians and military personnel and police are being continuously killed and hurt in the war. All of these people have one thing in common. They are all real people.
Out of the entire class, only one person raised their hand. They said they would make it into heaven.
It is amazing. Ltc Garey explains how he tried to communicate with the Afghan people.
I hope that one day I can meet the people who we call our enemies. I can build relationships with them. I can realize for myself that the world is filled with people who are trying to make it by with their family. They are trying to make it by with their pride. and to minimize war and external problems.
In conclusion, I certainly believe that most civilians have no idea what really goes on at war.
I usually get questions like how did you cross the border?
It is this kind of videos I would love to show to people that have countless times criticized other religions without knowing what their own religion is doing as well.
It was a tragic incident. It did not need to happen.
I could not imagine living in an environment like this. I could not imagine living a happy life while being constantly surrounded by war and violence.
In the Catholic faith, a reason to get marriage is the promise to God to reproduce his children.
I could not agree more with you.
The Religious Freedom bills passed in some of the states show how we are regressing.
I also think that Sam brought up some very eye-opening points in this discussion.
If a girl is infertile is it okay to divorce her?
This is not how I feel life should be. I truly believe something is out there watching me. It is possible guiding me.
I think this fact in and of itself is part of the reason why we have misconceptions. We don't realize that this could occur anywhere.
In the United States, the divorce rate is increasing rapidly. People are getting married and remarried two, three, and four times in a lifetime!
Islamic extremists have been responsible for 63 terrorist incidents in the U.S. between those dates.
I am a Christian myself. This though has never really occurred to me or seemed like a big deal.. I looked back at our country's history. I realized that every single president we have had thus far has been Christian. made me think about the subtle, subliminal oppression that other people experience on a daily basis.
People think they are dangerous. That always leads them with terrorist.
I knew that a part of me knew it was wrong. Sometimes these things so just so ingrained into our minds and our normality. We stop seeing what is truly right and wrong.
Rafi closed by saying, Do something good to stop the war. This really stood out to me. He is asking for our help.
We are at an age where we all want instant gratification when we're online. It rubs off on the real world.
This is a good example. Civilians of the country we are at war are not always against us.
As a society, America has certainly progressed. During the past few years it feels like we are going back to our old ways. Seemingly more with the Trump administration in charge.
Compared to other countries, we do discuss it a lot more. We definitely don't as much as it should be.
I chose this video. I believe it is an important subject matter. It is often overlooked.
I can't imagine being in Rafi's shoes. Rafis partner was murdered doing that same type of work.
I feel our country does not address the topic of race enough.
Many people, from both cultures, do their best to lead their lives in accordance to the holy book that they follow. Be it the Bible or the Quran.
Yes, all of Sams lectures are important. This lecture was definitely a bit more real.
It is unjust to criticize a whole religion based upon actions that an ordinary Muslim would never commit.
I also agree that Rafi has incredible bravery to do what he does.
For this weeks video response assignment, I chose the What Quran Are You Reading video.
The fact that his partner was murdered due to trying to serve justice is very sad.
All I know is that I will never be able to fully understand how they feel. Like you said we can at least keep learning about it.
I agree with you. War is a sensitive topic.
The main point to all of this is this. Humans are, for the most part, born good and learn evil.
Now, it's even worse. Imagine being a parent trying to raise and support a family. Imagine being a parent in this type of environment.
There are so many hate groups around the world that have resulted from wrong interpretations of these books.
Personally I did not fully think about how many people are truly affected by war in their everyday lives. Simply due to the fact that the war in Afghanistan is hundreds of miles away from my own home.
The fact that he gets death threats and living in Afghanistan. The fact that Afghanistan has been at war for so many years is astounding.
One example is a black person according to the constitution is of a person.
Why arent they given that chance at happiness.
Some of the letters in the new testament were included much afterwards.
I think it is important to find something that makes you believe in what you are doing. It is important to find something that gives you purpose.
I found it interesting. He was able to explain it to us. He felt a little uncomfortable at first. The older man came up to him. invited him into his home for tea.
I've also noticed they've become more relaxed towards the norms of today. Some things they just will not budge on, like gay rights.
This leads to people receiving very extreme views day in and day out.
I found this interesting. Christians and Muslims have held many religious wars in the past. They share the same holy people.
Men should be able to get a divorce if thats what he wants. Men should care for the family.
According to LTC Garey, it was times of fear or excitement together. Those bonds were formed.
These past few classes have really inspired me. I want to become more aware of exactly what is going on with the war.
Interpreting the Bible differently with Christians is the same concept. Muslims interpreting the Quran differently, creating radical Muslims.
All the photos and videos I have seen depicted the violence and destruction that has taken place over there.
Sam has done a great job breaking that barrier. He has allowed us to see into their lifestyles.
I think that it mostly has to do with generations.
This is where some individuals that are radical shine best. They start following the religion no matter the repercussions.
I think about one of the main reasons for this. People are unwilling to explore other religions. People become educated. Different religions work.
Because of the way the media portrays countries like this, I feel like a lot of Americans are like me in this situation. A lot of Americans have a preconceived notion of what these countries are like. Without this class, I would've stayed uniformed.
I now know that they are people just like us. It's despite the fact that they live in a country full of war.
Sam compared humans to being like fish in the sea.
It would be a huge victory to get everyone to care, let alone to do something about it.
I thought it was very interesting that Sam used the example of Donald Trump. He is a man who has abandoned Christian principles. He gets support from Christians. He promises them a version of Christian Sharia.
For example, if the soldiers were well versed with Afghanistans hospitality then then they would have received the necessary information about the Taliban sooner. Soldiers would have understood why such information was withheld.
Dr. Richards friend explains it. The war within Afghanistan is a proxy war.
It was crazy to hear about the number of afghan civilians that were killed. How easily it could be us and our families that are dealing with such loss.
I agree with you, Isabella. The world moving in the direction of mixed races is great regarding humanity.
Rafis partner was killed from an airstrike planned by the United States. He was someone who had similar beliefs as us.
I wish more people would look at religion the way Sam has showed us.
This clip was eye opening to see that Christians have a lot of hate too. It just goes under the radar. No one realizes that they are all Christians.
They are the same people you see around you every day. They live their lives in a different way.
When he experienced he realized that these humans are generous. They don't always carry a gun or knife with them. That's how people make it seem.
This helps them to be able to kill people. They do not feel as intense emotions while fighting.
I, along with a majority of the United States, should definitely want to learn more about our various countries throughout the world.
Now, in a way, many of us did not know what it was.
I also found it very interesting. He was present at a lot of the town meetings they had. He really got a good idea of what their culture is like.
Something really stood out to me. A student in our class had his house bombed in Syria.
The Middle East is not plagued by countries that don't want to rule themselves.
Colonial Rich right off the bat goes into the common notion that most civilians have about soldiers.
I realized that Afghanistan is a country that has endured a lot. Even with that, they live the same daily lives that we do and do the same day-to-day things as well.
There are people all around us that are affected by war.
Religious extremists have their right to believe in the books how they choose to. When religious extremists's belief starts to interfere with the rest of the world, then there is a problem.
Sam distinctively points out that the Bible and the Quran are more of the same. They contain similar moral principles on how to live one's life.
People argue over what the Bible means all the time. People can each interpret it in a different way.
Fortunately, we were given the opportunity to hear from Rafi. He is a civilian currently living in the conflict zone of Afghanistan.
Hearing about Afghanistan, I immediately thought of a war zone. This is due to what has occurred lately.
I agree how war really dehumanizes people.
It will be easier  for the soldiers to communicate with people who speak languages very different from English, Spanish and French.
It was truly eye opening. I often forget that part of those countries.
It is our country who puts war on so many others. Then we make it seem as if they are the bad guys.
The people of Afghan are not cold people. However, they have known war all of their lives.
It was hard for me as well to view these people as normal citizens like us. I also agree that we have been so used to it growing up whether it be from our parents, the news, or the media.
It is coming from outside of the borders. Afghanistan is more frustrated by this being ignored than any other problem thats being faced.
The media tries to make us feel better. They show us the struggles going on in other parts of the world. They show the struggles outside of America.
People over there do have real families and lives. Their reality is living in a war zone.
I agree with you in saying that this video was very eye opening for me.
Rafi came to speak in class. It was a good learning experience to me.
As you said they shop at mall like us, have jobs like us, and much more very similar things. We need to stop picturing them as bad people when they're really not.
Listening to Raffi speak about his people gave me a completely new (and educated) opinion of them.
The fact that the Israelis were very calm already eased the mood in our group.
I am open to relationships with people not of my race. I think more people should be.
Eventually it is just so normal. I stopped questioning whether or not I was being a bad person by making this sterotype.
We have access to many other resources. There are endless possibilities. At the same time, these young men were similar to us in many ways.
He has chosen not to be angry. It's something I don't think I could do, And, move past it even, just being happy that he is alive.
Just like Mr. Rafi said it is important for us to do something about it. It is important to just talk about it.
He showed the map of the active hate groups in the United States. I was surprised to see the high amount of groups. They were majority Christian.
We need to understand. Afghan people are just like us.
This tendency makes it common for people to care for a split second about the lives of people from foreign countries. Then they go on with their lives.
Most of our view on war is what we see on TV.
The leaders of the countries should be talking it out as opposed to the fighting.
The problem is there are a lot of people.
I understand that bad things are happening. that is only half of the story.
When we think of war, we tend to discuss the nation or nations we are fighting as one place, not the cities, towns, and families who make it up.
Civilians definitely DO NOT know what it is like to be a soldier at war.
My uncle was in the Army. Growing up he would tell me about his personal experiences while in Afghanistan.
I also thought it was very interesting that Maziar said that everyone, when he traveled to Iran, was extremely welcoming. Everyone taught him many things about their culture and what they believe.
I move through life with a phrase that is goodness of the heart.
We have this notion. Everyone in the Middle East is a terrorist. We should just bomb them all.
I agree. A lot of people's minds automatically jump to negative thoughts.
We should stop judging them as bad people. That is far from what they are.
They are more similar. I originally thought. Why would I put one down over the other?
Just let people live their own lives.
Right-wing extremists committed almost twice as many acts of domestic terrorism than Islamic extremists. The public perception is that Islamic extremism is a bigger threat.
We couldn't possibly know what these people have really been through. We need to talk to them ourselves.
It is one thing to talk about what happens in Afghanistan and other places around the world. To actually put a face to a name and feel like you personally know someone from these countries is a different story.
America is a very diverse nation. The presidents have all had the same religion.
Sam stated that war isnt just out there. Sam said theres normal people with hopes and dreams just like us.
It's how each person interprets the book.
I kind of assumed another thing. I thought our beliefs would be extremely different.
Change is only possible with the proper education. Getting the proper education begins with us.
There were Greek manuscripts. It contained different verses.
I really liked what you said in this post. I feel the same way you do.
Not many people look at it that way. When you do, you can see they are actually very similar when read literally.
I really enjoyed learning about the people of Afghanistan.
If images of children being injured and civilians houses being bombed were shown on news networks, the American reaction to the war would be drastically different.
He said that we can't do anything. We directly stop the war. Spread the word that war is bad.
As you said, this could be our friends and family. I cannot even imagine the thought of that.
This lecture also gave me a clearer picture of what Afghanistan is like.
The way I talk, the way I act, the lifestyles I have is all influenced by my cultures.
How can we follow this kind of lifestyle? Many Americans are fearful of this lifestyle in other cultures.
Their culture has been forgotten. It is looked down on.
We need to give them a chance. They introduce themselves as a person. We put a label at them. It is based on where they are from.
Its not okay to say that theyve been at war for years. They're used to it.
I think a big part of this is how the media portrays Middle Eastern culture. This makes people fearful of it.
We have been fighting in a foreign land for so many years. During this lecture was the first time that someone has mentioned to me that everyday people just like me have been personally affected.
We are only shown so much of what is actually going on. I think that when we hear about the number of deaths happening because of war, we never know how many people and families are actually being affected.
I strongly believe that opposites attract. That is why I am more attracted to the members of different races.
That mall is no different than the one I go to. If anything, it may actually be nicer.
It is such an important aspect that the military learns about the cultures of the places they are going to. This really helps them while they are deployed.
I like that this class reminded us of families - mothers, fathers, sons and daughters. All of who are innocent and scared.
I think the media also plays a he part in it.
This helped me relate to the people. I sympathized with them.
He chooses to slowly forgive.
Imagine the state gave one religion power over any aspect of government. It would inherently threaten the freedom of all other religions.
It seems to me that Americans could find more similarities vs differences. Taking the time to learn about the Afghan culture would help.
We can try our best to understand what war is really about. Unless you have experienced war or know someone who has you'll never get it.
I had a direct dialogue with Rafi. It allowed me to experience as firsthand as possible the current brutality of his world.
I questioned how everyone was so calm. About two weeks and a half into our trip fighting broke out between Israel and enemy groups in the Gaza Strip and Near Golan Heights.
We should start to view it in terms of towns, malls, schools, parks, homes and families. We can connect and see people living in war torn nations as people like ourselves.
Hate is not written into the bible for a good reason.
This is very different than how divorce works in the United States.
When the Arab spring first began it began in my parent's country, Tunisia.
How do American Muslims feel about the media's portrayal of Sharia law?
This comes back to the good side. The good side needs a bad side to root out.
When both these men spoke it made me feel so naive. I was thinking that two people could be so different without even hearing any of them speak.
The last part of class meant a lot to me. Sam introduced us to his partner and friend, Rafi.
We are lucky enough to have the choice to not live in fear like the Afghani people do.
He made me want to get to know the Afghan culture more.
This week I chose to reflect on the lecture. It focused on how war affects real people.
However, according to Professor Richards, the Bible and the Quran are actually much more similar than I thought.
We need to put ourselves in their shoes. Truly understand their struggle.
I think it gives a really good representation of who the Afghan people really are at heart.
The person gets comfortable. Their way becomes the correct way.
I was not raised this way. It is hard for me to understand their perspective.
I think with that statement, the sentiment that a number of Americans share that Islamic Sharia law is too traditional can easily backfire. The American code of law is also based on the Bible.
Americans never stop to think about what Afghanistan is really like.
Religion is confusing. No one person will interpret the Bible, Quran, Torah, etc.
It'd be interesting to explore. Is this a good or bad thing?
This is something that actually happens in Afghanistan. The people who live their have to deal with this everyday.
In my opinion, not any holy scripture should be used to help determine things. Not all have the same beliefs anymore.
Rafi is one of Sams good friends. He lives his life in Afghanistan. He's constantly dealing with the threat of war that surrounds him and his family.
I feel we in the United States dont realize what its like to live under war circumstances.
That is why conversations and open-mindedness are very important and necessary.
Growing up, we are all sheltered. We begin to harbor our on ideas of what the rest of the world is like.
People living in war zones are real. They deserve proper recognition from the public.
Your response captures exactly how I feel about the talk on the Afghanistan people.
He never knows if there will be an explosion any random day that could kill him.
This begs the question. Would there have been different outcomes of the war? People could have a clear understanding of what Afghanistan really is.
I don't think its worth being mad about. It's deeper than just believing anything you're told.
I also agree that the media has made blinded people into the notion that the Quran is a book that poisons the minds of people.
We need to stop viewing these countries as places that we are fighting. We need to see how similar we really are to them,. They are innocent people living in much more dangerous environments.
Additionally, I feel that your closing remarks on how he must continue fighting. He has already been working toward peace for so long to be very accurate.
This topic caught my attention. Before this class, I had never heard about this dialogue cross culture training. Our guest promoted it.
Christians do this because they follow the bible and this incorporates into their daily lives.
There isn't really a way to be sure of the exact meaning of everything in the Bible. Everyone has different interpretations. It makes it so difficult.
We tend to cast them aside. We strip them of their Christian label. We recognize their insane extremism.
Richard's story shows us that  they are normal people too. They don't look any different or act any different than everyone else.
I have a significant interest in how this war affects civilians. I feel young people can contribute towards putting it to an end.
People believe that soldiers are always endangered and fighting.
I would say that the Bible was written to be interpreted in one way. It has one meaning only.
The American soldiers shot and killed the children.
Sam has touched on this topic a lot this semester. I think it is a very important thing for people to realize.
I am from a very catholic family. I went to catholic school my whole life. I have many different lessons from the Bible drilled into my head.
Sam showed us the map of Afghanistan broken down. It was crazy to think about the number of innocent civilians that try to live a normal life like we all do.
For many people it is religion. For other people it is family.
Some families there go about their everyday life. Kids go to school. Men have jobs. People live the way you do.
Also, due to the fact that it is so far away we do not think there are real people just like us.
I love learning about different cultures and beliefs people have.
We need to learn about their life. Their lives have been ruined due to war.
This strategy is a lot more difficult to execute. However, it is a much more peaceful route. Civilian deaths will decrease tremendously.
We have so much hate in this world. I believe understanding others better and their cultures can lead to a better understanding of that individual.
I agree with you that our generation is more accepting of peoples' differences. People differ in religion or sexual orientation.
The colonels experience helped me. It was able to open my eyes. I started accepting and understanding other peoples background and culture.
CNN and FOX news are examples. They portray the extreme sides of the news.
It is much easier to get on board with the idea of war in a far away country by thinking they need our help.
I am a bit embarrassed to say this. I have never been on a plane before.
I am glad that we talked about this topic in class. I honestly never realized the many similarities.
The media in our country definitely doesn't help either.
As a citizen of the United States We cannot establish a national religion We cannot promote or teach one religion as being better than others
With this being said, I never really thought about how people within the same religion can have vastly different opinions.
They lived in a time where racism was ok. It was not viewed as bad. Everyone else in their area or family were thinking the same as them.
Becuase while we are all just people living our lives, there are significant differeneces between our countries. There are significant difference which makes it harded to realize that we are all very similar at our cores.
This is what everyone does. We never care enough to Google some pictures of the capital or their mall. We never read an Afghani journal.
They are innocent people who need our help.
Why can people who are 21 drink?
He says that both of these are two different worlds where real people live.
There is a  reason not much attention is given something newly introduced. The reason being the person already has a way of doing the task.
The way that he spoke so strong and clearly, never showing a sign of weakness, it was just truly inspiring. Meanwhile, the amount of dry eyes in the room kept dropping by the minute.
He also introduced us to his friend Rafi. He told us his story of how the war has affected his life.
To see his spirit so high gives me hope. It is something to believe in.
Some scholars think there are as many as five different voices in the Pentateuch.
Although they see it as a guide to their life, it is open to interpretation by everyone.
The guest speaker said that people there are welcoming. They are open-minded to everyone. They even invite people on the street to home. They have a cup of tea.
I is unimaginable what is is like to have your life turned upside down by war.
It would be more honest and try to reflect information that people want and need rather than follow their agendas.
Hearing Rafi speak really put it into perspective. These things happen to real people, just like us.
I have kind of experienced this. There are a lot of stereotypes about the Mexican culture.
Like you said, tolerance is key.
Rafi said another thing. I really liked it. He said peace always wins.
LTC Garey was quick to tell us all that in most cases of war, this isnt true.
Thank you for sharing.
That's that. It'll probably never change.
The man encountered civilians. They were not brainwashed by the extremist groups. They were just normal people who have families and feelings.
They have lived under war circumstances for a long time now.
Its hard to say how any one person would react to living life like that.
They are constantly doing different things to benefit their country. Direct combat is not always the answer.
I realized that I have never taken the time to think about the ways war affects not only our own nation. I have never taken the time to think about the people of other nations involved.
A lot of Christians interpret the bible in whatever way they feel like doing. There is no section or verse that directly states their actions.
This isn't World War I anymore. They're not in trenches and shooting at each other all day.
The soldiers assumed the kids were putting toxic gases around them to kill them.
There are so many offensive words that are said in our society.
People sharing the same religion does not mean they share the same beliefs.
We have always been told that we have the richest, best country. We are easily convinced when it is our own country being discussed.
I had a friend. They were about to go to Afghanistan. I was terrified.
Does anyone know what the bible is actually saying?
Media organizations show the extremes. They therefore make everything seem way worse than it really is.
The first thought that comes to me. I think of those countries are unsafe. Like you said not a good economic situation.
Afghanistan is a country that has known war for almost thirty years. What do we really know about the war and how its affecting the civilians of Afghanistan?
Every person is the same underneath skin color and facial features. Why treat people differently based on what they look like?
I think first and foremost it was a very interesting way Sam had built up to it. When he first told of the story of his friend and providing us with the graphic photos of tragedy that helped paint the picture for us.
Someone could talk about a mall in America, London, Paris, or Canada. I would not doubt it to be true.
I grew up with two Republican parents. They supported the Bush administration.
I probably like most people who never realized that it was more than just killing the antagonistic country.
In this way advertising corrupts influence and how cultures and certain values are viewed. The view of the negativity overrides what these people actually practice and work on daily.
What shocked me even more the that though was that I wouldnt have been able to tell you what quarter was which if I didnt have a tour guide.
I picked this video. I think it is an important subject.
It made me upset to hear that a man who is only trying to push for change and fight for a better life for his family is threatened regularly.
Something really struck me. He was telling us stories about his experiences. He told us experiences about having tea with the village elder.
He missed their culture. They were so welcoming.
The majority of people in Afghanistan do not want blood and war.
It is so enlightening that a man who has lost so much and undergone so much tragedy can be so strong and think so clearly.
No religion supports divorce. It actually is a sin. One cannot stay in an abusive relationship.
But after hearing Rafi talk, and seeing how much hope he has, it gives me hope. One day the conflict in Afghanistan will get better.
It's true what Dr. Sam Richard mentions about the war being out there. It is real.
I never really thought about the similarities between Christians and Muslims. Sam explained it to us in class.
It certainly helps to justify your cause when your beliefs are the only ones left standing.
I found it interesting. He said he spent a majority of his time with civilians. They were able to learn more about them, how ISIS was recruiting, where people went, and just more about their behaviors and patterns as a society.
I am white. Although in some situations I might be in the majority race, I do not see that as grounds to put other people down.
They listen to whose willing to preach about the book. Maybe they should read it for themselves to decipher the different meanings.
Those people killed are just like any of us. They're children, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers.
It is a very disturbing thing knowing that there are people who have this much hatred.
I think it is so terrible. Real people are just like you and me. People have to deal with war in their everyday lives. Disputes occur between governments.
In my past discussion group we talked about whether backlash is a positive or negative thing. I believe that in our class it is usually always positive.
I personally always have considered myself a good person.
Most of those wars were prompted by Christianity.
These three religions have been in conflict since the scriptures were written. Its crazy to me why people are still in conflict today when we have the internet at hand to educate us on our differences.
I feel that these similarities really hit home for most of the class.
We owe it to those people that have been affected by this war to help bring peace back to that region and drive ISIS out.
This was eye opening as well as amusing. If it came down to what the bible actually states, very few of us would go to heaven.
I honestly have yet to have to opportunity. I am able to travel around the world.
I feel like both religions were made to guide. They give people faith.
I feel like Sam presented this point very well. The way he connected his points and the logic he implemented made it very difficult for most people to argue with.
The Bible can be interpreted differently for many different people. People of other religions should be given the same fair point of view.
My little cousin lost a lot of her hair. She heard gunshots right outside her window.
I also agree with your saying. People are too afraid to learn things about other people or other countries.
I particularly loved a part of the class. He mentioned that people always comes on top. Historically he is right.
Normally you would think that everyone would freak out if people were trying to invade and bomb their country. Everyone just kept on with their normal lives.
The concept honestly does not make sense to me.
When we begin to feel a sense of interdependence as a human society, we will truly learn compassion.
War really does dehumanize people. We think of them as the enemy, often grouping innocent civilians in with that title. We think of them as the enemy, without realizing what we are doing.
I wish I knew they were so thoughtful, hospitable and generous. Maybe it would have shaped my opinion of the war differently.
Essentially, it would be setting the ground works for how we marry, how we divorce, how we should eat food, how we should worship, etc.
That really stuck out to me because I know I have always made generalizations about the people of Afghanistan that were not true.
Their job essentially is to study these people. They aim to gain knowledge on their society.
I have never been pro war. I have never taken a step back to reflect. How is the war affecting the Afghani people?
That is no way a family should have to live their lives.
Individuality is important. Diversity is key to success in our culture.
You don't know what buildings that are going to be hit. You don't know what will take the lives of those people that are in those buildings.
Just because some people did some bad things does not mean that all Islam people are terrorists or bad people.
It's amazing to hear. They live in fear. They are so welcoming to an American.
I believe this alone shows that soldiers have emotion. If they did not, they would not suffer from PTSD and would act as if the war was just another day.
This clouds our desire to understand the individual rather than the entire group.
There are many out there like him who have similar stories. It is heartbreaking.
They arent even considered whole. How is that fair?
I have always had respect for the army. It is hard to understand what they do on a day to day basis.
I feel so uneducated about it. It is really frustrating. Hearing Rafi first hand made it really hit home. This is not something small.
I've heard of people going to Afghanistan for vacation. I always thought they were crazy and stupid. These people would come back. They have such a positive view of Afghanistan.
That takes true courage to go against the grain and do what you feel is right, no matter the consequences that may or may not come from your actions.
I think it is necessary for us to realize all this. It is in our hands to ensure the happiness of such people.
When thinking about basing a society on religion, one must be careful. There are thousands of ways how people may interpret them.
Without Raffi speaking to us, I would still have that incorrect view of the Afghan people.
Sam probed us to imagine using the Bible as the only explanation for our laws and government and how we should live our lives.
Just look at Rafi. There are plenty of others like him who are constantly putting their lives on the line with no gear to protect them. They help rebuild their country.
some of the experiences during deployment may not always be ones willing to be remembered. these experiences united individual as one.
We start talking about that. It may make a difference. More and more people get to know about it.
They truly are real people with real lives. There is a caveat that they could be killed in war. This could happen at any minute.
I'm sure these are just small portions of crazy people. I know Nuns who believe in woman's rights, who have open hearts to everyone they meet despite their religion or color.
Rafi endures death threats everyday. Rafi is trying to make Afghanistan a better place.
If you are twisting the words of the bible into anything other that what is exactly written on that page, you are interpreting it. By interpreting the bible you are opening a door to many various ideas about what it is actually saying.
Not knowing that there are a lot of violent Christians bombing, killing, torturing and hating other people doesn't mean they're not out there doing so.
The mall in Kabul was bombed.
There was not a single article on how it was Americas mistake of bombing Basim's house or his brothers house.
The Bible has always fascinated me.
They also have to work to keep the society to run in the order.
Leaving home everyday fearing for your life is a horrible way to go through life. It makes me feel for the people of Afghanistan who just want peace.
The Bible is a way to have a belief in something. It's because it is holy or good.
If we as humans did not, the world would likely be a much more peaceful place.
I think this video definitely made us more aware. Real people in Afghanistan are going through war.
I had a stereotype in my mind. It was put there through media and other people's opinion.
I was mostly surprised by how much it seemed like a western civilization.
Again, we seem to only hear about terrorist attacks. Plus, how we will get back at them with the use of military force.
I was born in the US. I have no understanding of what it would be like to grow up in a war zone. Sadly, It happens to real children.
It is never going to be justified. There are many sides to the argument.
I wonder if certain parts of Sharia law, like requiring a certain fulfillment of reasons by the woman if she is to file, may bring down the divorce rate in a good way?
Islam has taken a lot of bad media coverage in the last decade due the terror attacks. The war in Afghanistan gave them a bad reputation too.
Life is not supposed to be that way.
Sam presented several graphs that showed the death tolls of Afghanistan citizens are continuously rising. They are not expected to decrease anytime soon.
I never really knew about this clause. Religion is brought up in politics all the time.
Here's another thing you can add. It's how LTC Garey talks about the relationship between soldiers.
No matter how much they proclaim they might be, they are following the Quran.
I know people who were directly affected by 9/11. My own mother used to work on the 102nd floor of one of the Twin Towers a few years before the attack.
How did we get this way?
Many consider themselves Christian. Are all Christians like them?
We see all of the stuff in the media about Sharia law. This man is actually one of the people that is fighting it.
I see your point about not being directly affected by the war. Your views are a little different. I have a dad and a brother who are in the military. I feel somewhat detached.
I could never do what he does each and every day. I have complete instilled confidence. I live each day. I do not know the outcome of tomorrow.
In the end, they are also people as well. I feel very fortunate that I am not in such a scenario like that. I do not know how I would survive in that country. It is hard to imagine my life compared to what it is right now.
I remember talking to a couple of young men. I believe they were from Iran. I talked last year in my World in Conversation experience.
I never knew that Afghanistan had town malls or cities. They are just like ours in the United States.
He said that his parents are well off and he doesnt suffer from racial supremacy. Solving racism isnt a problem that he feels he needs to urgently fix.
All this must come out. It must be talked about.
Our guest clearly emphasized that the only way we can stop war is dialogue. Our guest addressed an opportunity for students to take a step towards making the world a better place.
A holy book has teachings that only reach a certain point in which the follower of that religion has to apply what he or she believes is right. The follower of that religion has to apply what he or she has learned from the book
Perhaps a better alternative would be integrating more learning about the world in the school system to fulfill curiosity. Understanding of different cultures would be embedded at a younger age.
To figure out how to solve that issue of radicalism is pretty challenging.
I was very intrigued. Sam showed how subjective religious texts can be like the bible and the Quran.
The problem with radicalization (besides the obvious) are the blurred lines that come from the text they read.
Sam was talking about Christians  in class. The Christians believe that the way they interpret the bible with such hate is the work of God.
Rafi knows the harsh reality of this. It is extremely admirable. Rafi still continues to do what he does.
I hear the media talking about the war on Afghanistan. How can we stop ISIS? The only action we seem to use is military force.
According to me, culture is an important part of my life.
It helped me realize. We are not as different as I had thought originally.
I reflected on what came to mind when I thought of Afghanistan. All I could think about was the war too.
History shows that the mainstream media is quick to label an incident committed by a Muslim or any person of color as terrorism. Mainstream media is slow to do the same when the perpetrator is white.
The images of Afghanistan that I see are always of war torn towns. They are barely standing. That was all I thought there was in that country.
It is sad. They are being affected by war.
Families just trying to make a living just like ours.
It is just our difference in generation. This makes it harder for racism to not go away.
There is a reason why radical islam has the power it does. It is through force alone.
He tells us that the majority of his time overseas is spent engaging with civilians in Afghanistan. He is learning more about them.
War is very subjective. Innocent men, women, and children going about their business are completely affected by it every day.
We truly are privileged people. We never recognize it until it is taken away from us. We never recognize it until we see someone we know suffer in a way we haven't.
Remember Afghanistan is his home. No matter where he goes, he will always miss his home country.
People often argue about the meanings of certain things. There is no way to be sure the exact purpose or meaning of something Jesus said.
Everyone agreed that we would have been completely devastated. Everyone would have been angry about the bombing and would have done something about it.
It sounded difficult to believe given what has transpired in the country.
Just like fish, we are used to our environment. We just swim through life uninfluenced.
Civilians arent the only ones dying. Military personnel are there trying to help. Some of them are killed too.
He has been through hell and back. He is still willing to come and talk to our Soc119 class every year.
I think you brought up a great point in your discussion for this video.
Without having any knowledge about who you are.
Since 2001, the numbers of innocent civilians killed have only significantly increased.
Later in the video, Sam began to introduce his friend, Rafi. He told the class about his background and family.
I think that this topic was something extremely important for Sam to talk to us about. I thought this video was interesting.
People on both sides of the war are being brainwashed each day.
When do we feel it is time to step in when issues arise?
I know personally that when I see something in the news, I almost never try to learn more about it from another source I immediately start making generalizations about a certain country or population.
I had always just gone along with the general idea. Homosexually was bad. The Bible said so.
This inherit racism in the system makes the issue so much worse. Blacks know that they have less opportunity. The incentive to work hard diminishes reducing the number of opportunities available to them.
This often leads to large misconceptions from people. It creates incorrect assumptions.
Every time I hear some comment of this type, I feel absolutely indignant.
These books were written thousands of years ago. They are very cut throat and literal.
In addition, I think a carefully written law that establishes the relationship between the countries should be agreed upon first.
It is astonishing that people are able to put their fears aside. They stand for their country and fight for their people.
Life there is not easy. In order to end this stuff, discussion is the must.
We need to work through the hard stuff.
Overall, I personally have a much better understanding of how everyone's interpretation of the Bible, Quran, or any religious book can be very different. Based on what they are a part of. How they choose to interpret the information.
I could not imagine living in a place where I would see my friends and family getting killed.
Everyone is different. Everyone thinks/ processes information in a different way.
Most of these people use small, specifically selected lines in the Bible. They lead them to believe that white men are superior, homosexuality is evil, or that God wants soldiers dead.
The world would be a much better place if this religious ignorance was done away with.
He had terrible things happen to him. You wouldn't even know it.
Like you said what is going on in Afghanistan could also be happening here.
It is interesting to hear from people who are not from around here.
This thought is extremely upsetting. Many people believe that an Americans life is worth more than others. We are all humans. We are all created equal (in my eyes).
Hearing that, at first, It was a little bit troubling. Quite frankly, it was very frightening.
When we talk about this war we talk about how brave our American soldiers are. We pray for them every day. We are blind to a large group of people affected by this war.
I remember telling my mom that I was unsure if I believed in the afterlife. She immediately questioned if she raised me right.
Small villages that do not have running water, no internet, etc.
I literally know nothing about any of those nationalities - not because I don't have respect for them. I kind of just consider them all to be simply 'white'.
Take a look. Donald Trumps presidency has affected the military forces.
One part of the class really got to me. Sam showed Rafi's children on the screen.
This emphasizes the problems that races face in race relations. Impartial treatment has affected their lives.
I watched Rafi speak about the absolute atrocities that happened to his family. It was truly a humbling experience. It gave me a whole new angle on the war.
I often forget I have different heritages and backgrounds that are interesting. I have different backgrounds that are valid just because of the fact that I'm not a visibly different race or color.
I learned in class after listening to Rafi that that is not completely true. There are so many peaceful and kind people who live in those countries.
My friend spent a lot of his time working out. He trained Afghan military within the confines of the American military base.
I would find governing the United States based on the words of the Bible. It is not only extremely challenging due to interpretation, but it is undoubtedly unfair.
Afghan people, actually, have a more open culture than we do.
I knew friends that went on the trip before me so I was very excited to go.
For LTC Garey, this was probably an incredible surprise. His translator informed him that this Taliban member had been conversing casually with LTC Garey for what he says to have been hours.
Movement without the ability to question can stem into danger. Their opinions may line up with yours. We should be careful trusting any lifestyle that is inherently true.
There should be more conversations with people across the world. The views people have would be changed dramatically.
This was not what many of us were expecting to hear. That is kind of sad.
Sam said there is no clear answer written to these questions in the Bible.
Unfortunately, this idea could not be more wrong.
I really enjoyed listening to Raffi speak. It changed my view on how we see others.
I take full responsibility for being clueless. I am glad this class is teaching me to be more aware.
I applaud him for being able to forgive Americans. I know that I personally could never do so.
I like how Rafee talks about what life is like for the civilians in Afghanistan.
It is all about how the person interprets the Bible. It then applies it to his or her life.
And in the same sense it can also cause controversy through the Sharia. They could follow some things and not all.
There should be minimum use of religion in our government.
Grant, you make some great points.
I liked seeing the photographs of him. Seeing his family really helped me connect to those in Afghanistan.
He talks about Rafi and his family. He has two daughters.
The colonel told us about their experience. It helped us understand better what is going on.
Once I step outside and stop listening to the media, things really aren't as bad as they seem. Life is still going on the same it always has.
His goal is to make the subject of race and diversity more of a common thing. Everyone is comfortable talking about it. Their background doesn't matter.
That being said, I have never had very concrete views about what I personally think about religion.
I appreciated him sharing his experience. I think that a lot of Americans don't know about the Afghani culture. Things work there.
I think this may be because it is human nature to find it difficult to hold ones self accountable for his or her own actions. It is much easier to twist the words of the bible to justify ones actions.
I think a lot of problems come from not truly understanding the text. Obviously how people interpret the text.
Colonel Garey has done several tours in Afghanistan. He spoke about how his viewpoint on the war was totally changed after his first tour.
The way Sams compares countries and cultures really open up my mind to new ways of life. It proves how we are all 99.5% the same.
There are way too many complexities in life. People can't simply turn to one book written thousands of years ago to address.
All of this is no different from people living in America.
Rafi said that his friend was killed by the Taliban. His friend was was fighting for peace.
I have never been taught about the country in school, Nor have I never bothered to educate myself.
Hell, ISIS is out here attacking us on our own land.
We don't need such an iron hand in the Middle East.
It should not be okay to judge a group of people based on the country that they live in.
If we are harming innocent people, that makes us no different than the people we are at war with.
It is impossible to literally interpret the words of The Bible and apply them to the complexities of modern society.
We need more people like the colonel who is willing to learn and appreciate the culture of another place. We need people who not just assume that people from another culture are against us.
For me this made me realize how the war in Afghanistan isnt just people fighting in deserts alone.
I've talked to people. They are on board with bathroom bills. There seems to be a strange disconnect.
This really shows the importance of understanding other religions, even if you actively follow one already.
We need to find a way to better educate ourselves on the happenings of the world. We can make strides to better the world we live in.
Its hard to be able to state exactly what each verse in the bible means.
I have always associated the people with the war. I have never really thought they were any different.
I realize that not every human or Catholic is perfect or moral. My viewpoint was definitely changed after this video.
The part of this lecture that opened my eyes to this point the most. Sam showed us the images of a shop in a poorer town. Contrasted with that of the shopping mall in Kabul, a major Afghan city.
It shows that we are extremely lucky. We live in a country where war is not occurring.
It's amazing that they are so open to welcoming people in their home. Meanwhile, we are so closed off and view them as terrorists.
Being able to experience German culture was very eye-opening to me. I would like to continue to gain new experiences in new places.
I was very intrigued by the fact that so many countries could go to war with each other. I was very intrigued how so much life could be lost so quickly.
Being a psychology major, I found this particularly interesting.
It is almost as if the country of America is too naive to understand. Most of the things we hear about through media are extreme and amped up for the press and to attract attention.
It was very intriguing to hear what Rafid had to say about divorce in his culture.
Talking to others is such an important role. Everyone seems to stay quiet when it comes to these sensitive subjects.
It definitely made people think about and realize something. They were also part of one (or more) of these groups.
For example, when the discussion of legalizing gay marriage was such a debate, I had trouble wrapping my head around a fact. Certain people could not accept love for love because their religion believed otherwise.
I think we have the opportunity to change that in the coming generation.
Dr. Sam mentions that Rafi has two Afghan daughters. Dr. Sam's daughters are real people just like everybody else.
I believe this is how innocent civilians are killed. Sometimes they are thought of as hostile. They carry out certain things a certain way. In reality it is part of their daily lives. no one bothered to understand that.
If you want to buy a gift for one of your Chinese friends, make sure you never get a clock. The phrase to give a clock in the Chinese language sounds similar to the phrase used to say goodbye to a dying person.
Some action has to be taken, small or big.
The thought is beyond terrifying. Our society still often chooses to ignore what is happening to these individuals.
I feel as if people get divorced too much in the United States. I also think that in Sharia, more people may be unhappy with their significant other. The rules are very strict on the reasons as to why they can get divorced.
Common sense seems to be the key to living a good life. Many people feel they need a book to tell them if they are living right or not.
Average income for whites is expected to double in the next 30 years for white people. Black peoples average income is projected to increase about 10%.
This is unavoidable. Humans crave a feeling of importance. They want a sense of purpose.
What is the point of trying to make the future better for our children? We know that we are going to die. Our children are going to die. Our children's children are going to die.
This was a major eye opener for me. These people are in the middle of a century long war. They still want to be friendly to the US.
Eric, I agree with the things you have written.
It spoke out to me because my parents are Muslims. I was raised through the teachings of Islam (even though I eventually lost sight of religion).
merica has even written laws based on the Bible, for instance divorce. the Bible does not hold the answer to everything, only interpretation.
When discussing divorce in terms of U.S. laws and Muslim laws it was interesting how they were different in subtle ways. In the end, both sets of laws essentially did the same thing.
This class already is making me change how I think.
He then discussed how it is quite the opposite. It can be emotional at times. You create bonds with your peers due to the experiences you share.
I thought about all the Christians I knew. According to the Bible, some of them would not be going to heaven.
It's neat to learn about the different cultures and beliefs people have in other areas of the world.
Picking/ choosing parts of the bible to support these beliefs is what gives them such influence.
I have this prior notion. I am uninformed about the culture in Afghanistan.
It's all such a blurry topic. It ultimately comes down to the person.
This is due to the fact that people have different opinions on what triggers the action of wanting to get a divorce.
His wife says goodbye. Every day could be their last. It is just a truly saddening thing.
We naturally dehumanize the war. Especially when it comes to the other side.
I would say that the US is lucky that people here are actively involved in defending others from hate groups. The law empowers you to let you protest. It is since the church and the state are 2 separate entities here.
It is totally hypothetical. I think it would be very interesting to see what the world would be like without religion. I'm sure there would still be extremists in other regards. Maybe not having an ideology that you believe so strongly would be a good thing.
The September 5th class was extremely informative. I believe we could only benefit from hearing and learning about each others cultures.
That's who he sided with. He was trying to keep himself and his family safe.
It is crazy to think that Rafi lives in a country where humans his family never feel safe. There could be a terrorist attack at any time.
I really liked the story. The man would just invite new people in the village to have tea.
However, I do believe that could happen in the not-so-distant future.
It was very interesting to see all the parallels we had with Afghani people from across the world.
That scares people. There is nothing wrong with that. Humans are naturally scared of things they do not know much about.
War is a scary thing to experience. It's astounding that the Civil War was the last war on American soil. We are always participating in a war.
Having Rafi speak to the class help show that they are truly no different than we are.
It is incredible to see how fortunate Christians are. They are able to say or do things to a much larger extent that other religions would be looked down upon for in our society.
I ask why these innocent and nice people have to live in a constant fear of war and death. They have never hurt, fought, or killed anyone in their life.
i continued thinking after this lecture. Some people and the news can skew people's opinions about certain religions. It is unfair.
They might not have the best pronunciation. You can clearly see their effort in trying to learn my culture.
Complete books were taken off.
Their religion helped them get through the tragedies that they face every day.
I do agree that we need to be teaching more about tolerance and acceptance of differences. I always wondered is how helpful religion has actually been to humanity as a whole.
It meant so much to me. Sam made people realize how important it is to be more conscious and aware that there is more than one way to look at things.
I am dumfounded that Rafi has a family. Rafi still does all of this dangerous work.
All of the information from last weeks lectures were very interesting. There was one topic that stood out to me.
I cannot believe that those views are accepted by anyone.
I personally find it absolutely crazy how people would interpret that information. So they can do harm to others.
The idea that we have to stay in war to keep more groups from rising up is a counter intuitive narrative. It frankly has not proven true last year, nor the year before, nor the years prior.
I like that soldiers are not just fighting. I like that they think about the people's lives that they are effecting.
In the clip I watched, Rafi shares what war is like for the civilians of Afghanistan.
Your post was very well written plus interesting to read. I agreed with everything you had to say.
People have varying degrees of religiousness as well.
There is nothing wrong with that of course. It is a democracy after all.
This is an answer that would apply to any certain group of people having a special bond.
It can even lead to a change in your life as understanding more and growing your wisdom about what individuals do. Their culture can make a huge difference in the way you see the world.
This graph illustrates the inequality in the U.S.. It illustrates Afghan military personnel being killed in the war.
my dad's side of my family live in Germany. This helped me to acknowledge the prosperity of somewhere other than America.
Montreal was a new trip for me this past summer. Going into it, I had this schema made up. It was based solely on what I had heard or seen in a picture or two.
Do we use the bible as a coping mechanism? If I believe the bible is telling me xyz then that means I AM RIGHT and it is OKAY to do xyz.
LTC Garey shared that before he traveled to Afghanistan, people warned him to be wary. He was warned that the culture is completely immersed in war. The people are dangerous.
People think they know what is going on in Iraq. No one feels like they need to do their own research. They think they already know the whole truth.
Does this help to support Americas foreign policies in the Middle East?
Rafi's family deserves to live in happiness and safety. Rafi's wife doesnt have to worry about whether he will be coming back home that night or not.
That is the reason I feel our presence remains necessary.
This picking/ choosing of what we actually take into consideration is really a selfish act.
Just like most soldiers, my uncle suffered from PTSD upon returning home.
I always try to do what I think is right.
He explained that in that situation 100 years ago they came to a solution of having a sit-down negotiation. It helped the issues at hand.
The fact that Bassim and many others dont carry resentment in their heart for the US because he as he said they understand why what happens, happens is amazing to me. I couldnt say the same for myself if I was in his position.
Nearly every religion has been used as a platform for legitimizing and distributing hate against other groups. Some have even been created solely for that purpose, such as the Norse-influenced cult the Nazis created for themselves.
Radical Christianity exists. It is becoming more evoked. This change has occured since the presidency of Trump.
When I think about people in ISIS and the Taliban I think of people who are ruthless and would never be taken alive. This story showed me that my whole perception on what was going on over in Afghanistan was completely false.
Regarding Christian Sharia in America, I do not think it is fair. Homosexuality tends to be put down far more than the other groups on the list.
I know that sounds horrible. It's just what I thought.
On the news, we will see terror in the world by these groups. Everyone will point fingers at everyone who shares the same religion. They have a different interpretation of the books.
Thanks to Rafi, he is trying to make a difference. He's trying to fight for his people. This is something people in America need to try harder at.
I have learned a lot about the Afghan people these past couple of weeks.
Being in this class, I often wonder the same thing.
Parents who have students at that school who are muslim are outraged.
All religion is peaceful till its not. All religion can be violent till its not.
I found it very eye-opening. Rich described having to understand more about the enemy.
Therefore, I believe the US military should begin to move in more diplomatic ways.
It does not mean that all Afghan people hold these beliefs.
Some people take a book/ interpret it in a radical way.
We think as lawyers as great people just trying to do some good. In Afghanistan, you may not want to be around them for you might put your life in danger.
If a woman wants a divorce for the right reasons, she can get one. If men want a divorce, it is up to the wife. Men will need to take care of the family for an extended period of time.
The Afghan civilians were so kind and had such a welcoming and unique culture. Americans should think harder about their opinion on the war and those it affected.
My parents always did their best. They taught me not to judge.
They are not taught to hate Americans. They treat Americans just as they would anyone else.
It is rare to ever hear about a terrorist attack that was started by Christians. Tragic events like a terrorist attack happen more often than not.
The Bible is similar to the Quran. They are both based on an individual's interpretation.
Essentially, the Bible cannot explicitly explaining everything. We must use our great gift of intellect to solve certain issues.
The most important aspect is equality showing in this religion women are treated as a possession. The most important aspect is equality showing men are praised upon.
It all basically comes down to the way that people interpret their religious books.
It has happened before. What do we have today that is preventing it from happening again?
Yeah I agree we can't just pull out. We can't keep exerting this force to keep the countries destabilized. We fear that providing resources would better ISIS and the Taliban.
It seems like religion is only separated from politics. In the event that it is not Christianity that is involved.
I liked how Sam started off with a quote from the Bible saying that only homosexuals will not make it into the heaven. He  then completed the quote with the full list of people who also will not: fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, sodomites, thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers, and extortions.
I am from Philadelphia. The farthest I have been from there is Indianapolis. The Big 10 Championship game was last football season.
I couldn't even imagine living in that kind of of situation. I could not think about the thoughts that run through Afghans' minds.
I had not really thought about that fact before this class. Thinking about it, I'm not really sure how prominent everything in the media talks about really is.
These two extremes come from how people interpret the Bible.
I think that the amount of deaths that take place because of war are just completely awful.
This occurs before, during, and after these horrific events. The inhabitants of countries across the sea are facing issues. Issues have never even really crossed my mind. I live in America.
The is a perspective of how these topics are closely tied into religion. It explains why people feel compelled to defend their beliefs.
Both follow the same religion. Someone has to solve these problems. Someone could have different translations of what certain things mean.
I never really felt affected by this issue. I had always recognized it.
I do not worry about more interracial couples at all.
I found the Radicalizing the Bible video to be very interesting.
In my opinion, the whole of organized religion has that problem.
Rafi is the father of two daughters. Rafi is actively involved in social work, including the type that work hard to protect females and secure their safety.
Dr. Richards friend continues to elaborate. There is a different level of trust between what happened in Oman and what is happening today.
I thought it was really important for Sam to have Rafi speak. It really puts things into perspective.
Christians and Muslims have held many Crusades and Jihads against each other.
I found it interesting. And, a bit shocking. To hear that most of Rich's time in Afghanistan consisted of more time talking and engaging with civilians Rather than fighting.
However, in class, we learned that this is not the case.
I responded to the same video that you did. I said some similar things in my response.
Two Christians could have totally different views on things like divorce, marriage and death because of what they truly think is right or wrong.
It is so hard to put myself in the shoes of the Afghan people like Rafi. They live every day in danger of losing their life.
Being in the 21st century I would say these laws are way passed its time. We as a whole should evolve with the world around us.
During class, I learned that the Bible, the Quran, and the Torah are all open for interpretation.
It is apparent. Everyone's first thoughts were those. It is a war zone.
Everything in life is always relative. Clearly, everyone has their problems. However, some are more major than others. Seeing the way Basim has dealt with his struggles. inspires me.
I consider myself Christian. I wouldn't look in the Bible to learn how to live my every day life by following every rule that is written in the Bible. I think many people would agree with that.
In the video that I chose, a special guest discusses how dialogue helps with bringing peace in relation to the current war.
I feel that many Americans have a negative stereotype against people from the Middle East.
I saw him tell a classroom of 700 American students something. He said he does not blame us. It was extremely inspirational. It makes me want to strive to be a more forgiving person.
He does not have spite toward people of the United States. It is a tough thing for anyone to do.
He helped humanize the people of Afghanistan. He proved to us that they are just like us.
I think you're right that people put it out of mind. It's easier than putting that effort into having an open mind.
Do different sects of Islam believe in different versions of Sharia law?
Christians say that we should use the Bible as a basis upon which we should establish our society.
I didnt know much about this culture. The little things I knew were just negative.
I am a science major. I believe in evolution. But I've always had trouble understanding this whole concept of life.
The colonel talked about their warm welcoming and invites to have tea. I think about the US
He showed the picture of Rafi. I felt something I haven't felt before.
Time and time again we see. Nonviolent movements achieve their purpose.
Once Rafi fully told us, Okay, these are the valid reasons for a woman to file for divorce in Afghanistan, I realized that a lot of them were reasonable. Afghan women were perhaps not as trapped in their marriages as I had initially thought based on my perception.
We also discussed how it was completely insulting. The United States barely gave him any money for restitution. I believe that it was only $15,000.
The statistics about all the lives taken during war, civilian and military, was eye opening.
The more we are aware of what is happening in the world, the more action we can take.
I feel that if we were shown more we would have much more empathy towards the situation then we currently do. This is sad.
I thought it was a very interesting lecture. I think that people often overlook how similar they truly are.
I agree with Samantha's idea. A small portion of a group doesn't represent the whole group.
I agree with you Gillian. I was very intrigued and inspired by Rafis answer to this question.
The laws hold the men both morally and legally accountable. That is interesting.
Its our fault that the region was destabilized in the first place. We thought we were doing the right thing at the time. The power vacuum we created gave rise to even worse things like ISIS.
Sam showed an example of Christian Sharia Law. I thought it was radical.
This made me realize something. We are only being given half of the story.
They have the same moral views, stories, and life teachings. They help us. We understand how to live in our own world.
The way Basim had the ability to forgive and go on living a positive life is truly motivating.
He talked about, What is Sharia. I have never really known what it was. He explained it.
It is scary my parents are stuck in their ways. Extremists will always will be.
Sam did a great job bringing in Rafi. A lot of people won't believe whats actually going on until they actually hear it from someone who lives it everyday.
I have been raised in a Christian home. I consider myself a Christian.
It is not as long as the Bible. It is more complex then we even know.
A person is taught a certain specific thing. That is the way they will be most comfortable doing what they learned.
I found it very eye-opening. Sam compared Americans' fear of sharia law. Many Americans push Christian Sharia Law.
He interprets the Quran. He makes it into laws that can help people in Afghanistan.
Some of these people are starting war. Others are just trying to survive.
I also agree with what you are saying.
I believed that Sharia Law consisted of people killing others who are not islamic, killing homosexuals, and oppressing women.
Its a very interesting law. We break it all the time.
If we just didn't relate Afghanistan as a synonym for war we can maybe see the big picture. We could  realize that they have good, hard working people who are just trying to live their normal lives.
The video is a student's question. It compares what the Taliban does to what happened in Oman with tribalism and having many people against the government.
I have a great respect for these people. I thank this class for helping me understand this much more than I did before.
People actually cared to learn about Islam. They would encounter indisputable similarities between the two faiths.
I agree with you. All of these images really make me rethink everything I had previously thought about Afghan people.
I don't think that there are any wrong interpretations per se. I personally do not stand for violence or hate from someone's interpretation of a religious text.
I am sitting here trying to imagine a life like theirs. At the same time, they dream to live a life like mine.
I understand what the Afghan people feel about the US and the other countries who enter into their country. These intruders know nothing about what the Afghan culture is like. These intruders think the Afghan people are all hostile, and that all they want is violence.
People judged them. They blamed them all. Some people of the same religion differently interpreted what they are supposed to believe in.
I thought that was very interesting. They have that special bond with each other.
This video allowed me to reflect. I already knew about the army. I obtained more knowledge about the army. I have more appreciation for the men and women in service.
The Taliban were among the crowd.
They do not take into account the ways life has changed over time. They do not take into account how things are not so old fashioned. Things are not so old fashioned in how we live and punish and such.
How can our government stand on its principles? It's oppressing a group of people instead of helping them.
Seeing small children, who dont yet understand the meaning of war and peace, causes me to feel even worse that they are suffering through something like this.
You made a lot of good points in your post. I agree with a lot of what you said!
One of the hardest things to do is to put yourself into dangerous situations. Loved ones are at home waiting.
These people choose our countrys safety and our safety over their own. Therefore I believe we all should and do have massive respect for them.
Not for reasons to kill and fight.
The simple confusion of traditions led to the death of children. They only sought out peace.
War is all around them. They live happy lives.
I believe our country is like this because of the awkwardness and discomfort of certain topics.
I was brought up thinking this. We were fighting the Iraq War to prevent terrorism at home and abroad.
From their dialogue and answers to the questions that others ask, my perspective on Afghanistan as a country and its culture has completely changed.
Just now, I am making a generalization about people making generalizations.
Members of the KKK aren't Christians. These terrorists are not Muslims.
I feel that it's really important to try and understand different cultures. The problem is not everyone feels that way.
I think you have a really good point here. The answer to this war is actually very complex. The answer leads to many circling arguments and a massive headache.
No one will really ever know it. What is the correct way to determine the meaning of the bible and verses?
I realized what their job over there actually is.
These girls in my class definitely have prejudices towards Muslims. I do believe it's also the teacher's fault not to teach them that an evil individual doesn't mean the whole religion's evil.
Nicole, I agree with your statement that we truly have no idea what goes on over there. We are presented everyday with misconceptions.
Sam's presentation showed clear and raw evidence of the harsh realities that have occurred. They have come from people of each of these religions. This shows that hate comes from within an individual. You may label yourself as a religious person. doesnt make you good.
I definitely agree with what youre saying here Juilianna!
I am a huge supporter of traveling anywhere you can. It does nothing but make you more knowledgeable as a person. It is a very exciting experience.
This era is plagued with Islamophobia. Closed-minded individuals tend to demonize the acts of a few to cast generalizations upon the whole.
You see Christians in movies or shows. They look peaceful. It doesn't mean that all Christians are the same way.
I feel like when we talk about the war, the majority of American people picture the Afghan people as some sort of monsters. We fail to realize that they live in much the same way as we do.
In my eyes religion is something that should be completely up to the person involved.
They play, learn and have friends. Despite this, they live in such dramatically different circumstances.
I think these negative stigmas stemmed from 9/11.
If we stayed away from social media and chose to be ignorant, we could. A lot of people actually do that.
The quote from Christian Reconstructivist Gary North said, We must use the doctrine of religious liberty to gain independence for Christian schools until we train up a generation of people who know that there is no religious neutrality completely baffles me. It goes directly against what the Establishment Clause says.
Rafi showed us that the culture in the middle east is very similar to our culture. Many of the beliefs of Americans are wrong about these people.
I found this especially interesting as a Christian. People including myself go to church and follow the bible in some aspects. We do not for nearly all of them.
We all have jobs, careers, families, dreams, etc.
They are not in combat the entire time, just like you stated in your response.
In this lecture and others, Sam brought up many good points about what we should do. There are many laws that prevent us from doing things.
I was raised in a Christian hom. I found this topic very intriguing.
All these people know is war.
I thought, of course all those people must be terrible human beings. They support the terrorist attacks by their people.
The student continues on to relate the proxy war in Afghanistan with the war back in Oman. The student claims that the war in Oman was also led by alternative interest such as the British, and the communist Soviet Union.
The confederate flag and memorials are reminders of history. That phrase on money is a reminder of what our founding fathers based the constitution on. It is a reminder of the social climate of their time.
Some people choose ignorance. They dont want to know about all of the bad things happening. I think everyone should have a decent amount of understanding. Not all of Afghanistan is at war constantly. and there are not always bombs going off 24/7.
This can go to show why a Bible based social political economic order would not be very effective.
Seeing those little girls made me sad. I feel for them.
It has always interested me how people interpret the Bible in many different ways.
I personally agree with the student/ I do see where hes coming from.
One war that I have heard about in my lifetime quite often is the war in Afghanistan.
To listen to a man speak who had everything stripped from him from his child, his wife and his brother is utterly devastating.
He has a family that he says goodbye to every morning when he leaves for work. He doesn't know if he is ever going to see them again.
But hearing Sam say the things that he did made me feel like I needed to be more open to accepting people. It made me feel guilty. I think I am good enough to be judging other people on things that have nothing to do with me.
All that they know is what the media portrays them to be.
Groups of people use the bible to justify whether something is right or wrong, It blows my mind.
You often hear people talking about the separation of church and state. The government needs to stay out of matters that are decided upon by religion. No one seems to actually separate the two.
A quote that I like relevant to this is The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing by Edmund Burke.
To me, this is very cool/ interesting to know. I thought it was more of the complete opposite!
The media/ those controlling it want us to have this type of outlook on these people.
Society has this perception. We are uneducated about the topic of the military, about war.
I also think it was a good idea to aim this at college students. Alcohol, for example, is one of the many prevalent things found on college campuses.
To my understanding, this program allows students from different nations to talk about the normal life of Afghan people. They discuss how the war affects their everyday lives too.
This shows how different each person's interpretation of the Bible can be. Stereotyping people within a certain religion is so unfair.
In my opinion, this lecture was meant to shed light on the common misconception. These two religions are different and to further establish that within their own religions. People interpret the values however they want.
This is depressing. People like Rafi's friend are killed.
We see this in the way new is presented here in America.
In America, a very small minority of the nation are involved or invested in the political tension and turmoil. Because that is what is exciting, the media blows it all out of proportion.
Personally, I know I'm uneducated about where I come from.
It had always been something that seemed so far away from me. I never found it of importance to learn.
Do not support the war. Even by doing that, you can help make a difference.
Imagine people put more effort into understanding the Afghani people. they may actually change their mind. they may want to make a difference.
Peoples' lack of flexibility or acceptance is what causes this separation.
You mention that it's a huge risk. At the time it comes to dropping a bomb.
I think this is something that not many Christians are aware of.
This part of class was interesting to me. It started the conversation of interpretation of the Bible. We talked about how we use these interpretations to establish a society.
They are not given that chance. The people that try to encourage peace and fight for their rights are put down.
Ask if you need to take off your shoes when you enter their houses.
They seem like they are very peaceful. It is sad. We are having this war.
This is an uphill battle. It continues every single day.
It opened up my mind to start truly thinking about being put in other peoples shoes.
It seems we are not.
I felt that it would be the other way around. It was not.
It's as you mentioned. I also live in an area where I don't have to worry about my life being in danger each day.
Sharing stories from a perspective who has personally experienced them is much different than hearing a story from a stranger on the news.
I really also appreciated how Sam put up real pictures of Afghanistan. They depicted the real, normal lives of the Afghani people.
In the last couple of slides, he talks about his friend Rafi Nadiri. Rafi Nadiri lives in Afghanistan.
I'm not the only person who sees their heritage this way.
In America, we luckily have not had to worry about an international war coming to our country. Unfortunately, that is all people, in other parts of the world, have ever known.
I do not know what is clearly going on between the U.S. and the Middle East.
This film is about a Muslim man. He killed a young Puritan girl in her school.
A white Christian commits an act of terror. Many times, it is not referred to as terrorism.
Rich explains in the clip that he did not have a huge idea what their culture was like when he first arrived in Afghanistan.
I agree with Lieutenant Colonel Gary. They are some of the most welcoming people.
It is a bigger and more serious topic. There are thousands of people who are hurting, stressing, in danger, and struggling.
You could tell just from Sam's storytelling and the pictures. This was going to be a heavy, heart-wrenching story.
As early as January 27th of this year did the president of the United States sign an Executive Order. An executive order protects the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States. An executive order ban admission for 90 days by citizens from the predominantly Muslim countries of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.
So if you're sitting in your living room with your lights flickering because the Smiths down the street just got hit by a half ton bombby accident are you going to keep eating dinner or decide to move your family.
Things have a chance of improving. I believe it is heroic for him to risk his life. He risked his life repeatedly for his country and his family.
They even have normal shopping malls that resemble US malls.
I know personally, most of what I knew about war came from the movies and some news channels.
The holy texts do not encourage the disgusting violence, the killings that occur.
Men and women do not want violence and fighting.
Overall, that class definitely opened my eyes. I saw what was really going on over there. I saw how this war is impacting its people so much.
I would not attribute the lack of tolerance all directly to the wanting to be correct.
Also, being gay, transgender or other, not all of it brought up in the bible or Quran so what do religious people.
I think this was a great class. I appreciate all that Rafi shared with us.
I was raised to be a christian girl. Over the years, I have strayed away.
Why do we even need rules to follow on some things?
This would be like saying Christianity believes in the same traditions as the Westboro Baptist Church about god hating homosexuals and being unpatriotic.
I haven't seen anything positive on TV about this culture.
We went to war in Afghanistan. The United States as a nation was attacked in one of our worst tragedies, 9/11.
It really is a shame to be sheltered.
It will be impossible for one person who has their own interpretations. Another person believes in a different way to agree on the same topic.
I found this class very interesting. war is something that is talked about on our news stations all the time. how much do we really know about it?
It is important to remember. Like it says in the video, that these people are not walking around the streets with weapons trying to find trouble
You could wake up, go outside, then see your neighbors house get bombed.
I hope that more Americans understand that these people are just like us. They were just unfortunately born into the wrong place.
The discussion was an eye opener for me. I gained a lot of information from it.
You cannot blame those who are ignorant for acting the way they do. The know no better.
I am glad that our class had the opportunity to share this eye opening experience. Most people do not have that opportunity.
Those not involved in the war suffer. Those involved in the war are suffering.
We only see the bad poor parts of Afghanistan and hear bad things about the bombings. There are other aspects to this place in the world that aren't all necessarily bad.
Also, I feel that people fear what they don't know about. They fear things that they can't understand.
War has a huge impact on their lives. We often forget that Afghanistan is real country just like us.
It might not seem to be an entirely progressive option at first. Talking face-to-face with afghans enables a connection to be made between those involved in the conversation.
It's also interesting to see how this issue is rarely talked about. It's interesting how Christians today react to Muslims.
I really enjoyed Rafi coming to our class/ speaking to us.
It can change. Where you are in your life matters.
It is incredibly mature an impressive of Rafi. He reached a state of peace about the situation.
Everything helps. It is our generation's duty to fix barriers. The older generations have set them up.
This way of thinking is so commonly accepted. People assume that all Christians are hateful antisemites and racists.
government cannot start a church. They can not pass laws that aid any religion. They can't  promote one religion over another.
Both are filled with different tales of life lessons.
I always pictured them as people who wanted war. After this lecture, I know I was wrong.
Talking about how the bible has become the framework of moral ideas. The topic of religious involvement in government affairs.
It is put into a bad light. Many Americans are not easy to accepting it.
Both of my parents serve. I respect them beyond anything for their service to this country. They don't need to be deployed.
They have been victim of Taliban, ISIS etc.
Dr. Sam Richard mentioned that Rafi's partner had been killed for trying to help people out. It really touched my heart.
We saw pictures of their malls and their traffic jams. These showed us that they have normal everyday lives just like us.
This topic came up during our Soc 119 Lab on Friday. This topic turned into a heated debate.
Sam also mentions that just because you dont know specific Christians killing and harming people, doesnt mean they arent out there.
We all know that people everywhere have same hopes and dreams. We don't truly understand it until we see it or experience it.
It is very eye opening to me that the civilians hate war. They want it to end just as much as everyone else does.
War actually exists. More innocent people are dying.
In class, we grew a relationship with Rafi. We all realized the bigger impact the war has on people all across the world.
I never really have thought about it. He thinks in such simple terms.
It is saddening to know that we all are aware of the devastation that occurs in Afghanistan. It is almost as if we pretend that it is not happening.
We take what others show us. We don't question it. We don't try to know more.
This means that they will use their interpretation of the religion to follow it through.
I feel like most people try to avoid the thought that war is actually happening in Afghanistan.
Rafi made me realize that my generalizations were wrong.
It was so interesting to listen to Sam compare them.
It can be confusing. One nation may have one way of doing something. If it is not done that way it can affect the nation as a whole. It can go against their morals.
He finally ended by talking about ending the war.
This Clause made by our founding fathers clearly wants the public to treat the two topics as separate. It is simply wrong for certain politicians to want to bring back Christian values into schools and public places.
The people that are just like us, with the same aspirations. They don't deserve to live like this in fear while we live in peace. Most people just want to fulfill basic needs and hope to one day be alive and live in peace.
There are radical Christians too. I think that many people forget about that. They just stereotype Muslims into being radical. They are not thing about other religions.
I believe that as long as there are people like him in Afghanistan, and in the world.
There are many people out there, including myself. We have goals in life. We would like make this country better in any way.
I said the same thing in my video response. I think the world would be better. It would be better with more people like Rafi.
This is what I dont like.
This shouldn't be the case.
There are individuals who possess this mindset. These individuals do exist.
I personally believe that the media does this intentionally. The media dehumanizes the citizens of Afghanistan. The media ensures that Americans do not protest against the war.
This is a side note. I was reading about something relatable the other day. It's going on in Canada.
Most people who think about the military would describe them as fighting for our country. I find it enlightening to know that they are affecting others lives in a good way as well.
The more people we develop personal connections with from the other side, the less likely we will be to make hateful or disrespectful generalizations about.
Many Americans will only watch what they believe in and what they are content with.
No conflict will be resolved by being ignored.
Coming from my background, I know people who are not as open to biracial couples.
This is all just speculation. It is interesting to think about.
The media wants to make America look more advanced than the rest of the world. That is not necessarily the case.
It is easy to see that those are the people on the other side of the court. They must be the bad guys in the end. Being detached from a scenario isnt the same as avoiding it.
One thing you might want to add in the beginning is that LTC Garey believes that citizens think soldiers are ROBOTS!
Unfortunately, some countries might not have that. The resulting conflict/violence is then amplified by media catchphrases to demonize entire groups of opposing views.
Rafis partner was murdered. He was working with the people. He was trying to help.
They are in a war zone being killed by their own people. they can still find room in their heart to care.
It will be easier for the Chinese students to explore other cultures if they speak their languages.
I know that just in these past two weeks of class my eyes have been opened up to so many new things. We all need to remember that they are people too. They have real lives just like us.
I think what Rafi and his fellow people are doing is wonderful.
I chose this video. It had a lasting impression on my thoughts. It made me think a lot about what religion really is. It means so many different things to different people around the world.
The number of civilian deaths keeps rising. They're just trying to live their lives.
We group people together who don't deserve to be grouped together. all Muslims are not extremists. all Christians are not extremists.
I think that everyone should have a little bit of exposure to what that part of the world is like.
For me, the discussion of war makes me upset. The Afghani people are just like us but living in a war zone. They have to live in fear.
The Bible will not give explicit answers for all of our complex ethical questions of today. There is no way of knowing thousands of years ago some of the ethical dilemmas we face today.
I only have immediate family in New York. Lliterally the rest of my family was in Tunisia.
I grew up Christian. It's due to the fact that my dad is Catholic. My mom is Lutheran.
These lectures have opened my eyes in more way than one. These lectures have given me entirely new perspectives on war.
I also agree with you. Sam's ultimate goal of his lectures is to try to get us to look at things with different perspectives.
This class definitely gave us a different perspective on how not all Afghans are the same. Some are not the cause of war. Some are trying to create peace instead.
There is no version of the bible stating that people with differences deserve to be hated.
Some interpret the words (like Sam said in a different video) to turn to violence. That's what they think the bible is telling them to do. That's why this situation is so interesting to think about.
Everyone deserves the right to follow whichever belief system they chose. They should  be completely safe in doing so.
Whenever I thought of Afghanistan and the war before this class, I always just pictured it happening in the middle of nowhere where civilians wouldn't be affected.
White supremacists are so against Muslims and Jews. All of them share extremely similar religious views.
I really loved the way. Sam explained the meaning of sharia..
LTC Garey had the opportunity to see their culture. He was welcomed by the people.
We often don't realize how hard their lives can be.
Something struck me while Sam was talking. The Quran is basically the same thing as the Bible. It's something I did not know.
The cultures of other countries is an extremely important area of American education. The cultures of other countries is a mostly neglected area of education for Americans. That would be the best way to get the general public to be more open and accepting.
It's regardless of doubt or freight. I think it is amazing that goes through his mind. He remains loyal. It's something almost no could be able to do.
Religion to me has become confusing. Older generations just followed it with no hesitations. They expect us to just do the same
They have families and loved ones who are suffering because of the fighting that is going on.
I know I am not alone in thinking that their entire lives revolve around war.
I never really thought about there being lawyers in Afghanistan.
Glenn, I completely agree that talking about other races and religions is the best way to gain a better understanding of their viewpoints.
The Bible can serve as a tremendous source of wisdom and strength. It is by no means a book of governing laws.
Colonel Garey came to class. He discussed two different viewpoints on the war in Afghanistan.
Having knowledge can keep situations such as the one Garey retold during class from occurring.
The whole time I was listening to the story I thought oh the guy they finally caught is probably locked behind bars and being questioned. They wouldn't take any risks with a member of the Taliban being there.
You would not be able to tell by just looking at me.
If we take the time to be good and show respect for one another and realize that not everyone is the same. Maybe wed end up in a better place.
Everyday, they wake up with the fear of dying that day.
Its hard to think about that living in America.
Innocent lives were lost due to a miscommunication between the children and the American soldiers.
He talks about all the hardships he goes through by living in Afghanistan with his family.
I was upset to hear that Rafi receives death threats almost every day . He literally has to live in fear.
I couldn't imagine living how him and his family do.
The rhetoric of our president needs to change. Under the current president, it is going to be hard to combat terrorism in the name of Christianity.
It was especially hard for me to hear. Rafi gets death threats on a daily basis. Rafi could be killed at any moment. He leaves his two daughters without a father.
Many people, myself included, are unaware of the majority of the things going on in other countries.
One of the fundamentals of  Christianity is to never turn away those who need your help. Through his stance on immigration, he is already violating that. It's an awful contradiction.
It isn't fair to just jump to conclusions based off society's common knowledge.
I didnt even realize that they had a court system even.
They only want to show what is convenient to them.
In part, I think that is the way, as Americans, we are brought up to think.
I found it interesting. That in his culture they have to make a promise at the wedding of how much money they will give their wife.
I think many peoples' views on the world are altered by what we see on the media. It's important for us to realize that the media only portrays what it wants to.
I think that Sam did a very good job explaining this topic.
It must be especially hard to grow up in an area like Afghanistan. A war is currently taking place there. They aren't even be able to understand a comfortable and safe life.
We had another discussion with several American students They talked about going to different European countries.
It made me reflect upon myself. It has impacted how I observe others unique backgrounds. Based solely off of their physical characteristics.
We now realize that. There is much more to it. It is more than just classifying someone as Asian.
The actions of the past couple of months. There is hope that some of the intentional ignorant see the hurt this type of thinking causes the world.
I believe a lot of the issues behind racism have to do with generations. The way our parents were raised. The way our grandparents were raised.
I know my grandparents grew up believing white people were better white people were better than every other race in a way
I'm sure to an extent, my own parents believe that.
This was definitely my favorite class up to this time. I thought it was the most fascinating, quite enlightening.
I was actually going to volunteer for this activity. Most people are wrong about my ethnicity.
I thought the group exercise of matching ancestor groups together was fascinating. A lot of people think they know your ethnicity. Based on just looking at your skin color/the way you dress.
I am half Cuban/half Irish. Mostly people just think I'm white.
A lot of people think. She's white. They hear her strong accent. She speaks Spanish.
I like it. Sam picked out Jefton randomly. Sam had him pick out someone. He thought they went together. based on quickly looking at them without being biased.
Jefton had more time. I think that. He would've taken a closer look. He would see the different mix of races in people.
We don't usually admit it. We place ethnicities together on just looking at our skin color.
This activity makes people realize. We are all diverse.
Our country will, most likely, always have to deal with the issue of race.
The United States was built on a racist foundation of slavery.
Everyone would like to put racism in the past. Races are not all treated as equal in our society.
Racial tensions are in an extremely heightened state.
This issue has become extremely prevalent with the recent events. It has revealed the white supremacists living in the USA.
The polar opposite of the alt-right movement is the Black Lives Matter organization.
Racism is an issue that needs to be dealt with. It cannot be ignored.
Every time I would wear my hair natural people give me complements people say how much they loved my hair.
I think that it's true. Everyone wants what they don't have.
This discussion in class gave me a different perspective on why my hair is the way it is.
We should all love what we were born with. It shows us about our ancestry.
That's why I think that we should all love what we got!
In time I came to the conclusion that I was incorrect.
Growing up in State College, I never really saw blatant racism. Until middle school and high school.
Maybe I did see it. Maybe I just did not understand it at the time.
I noticed in high school that most of the people were just ignorant to their privileges. All their friends were the same.
I agree that its hard to know for sure what to believe. In terms of creation versus evolution.
All I know is what creationists believe.
It wasn't until I got to college. I really began to see the differences between the two.
I decided to write an essay comparing evolution to intelligent design (aka creation). Both theories effectively explain how we got here.
There is a lack of the concrete evidence This assures me that creation is how all livings things appeared.
I always considered myself. I am a very open minded person. I believe we are all equal. The race does not matter. gender, or culture.
Sam's talk about evolution opened my eyes. it's not only the fact that we are the same in term of rights.
We all deserve equality. We are human beings.
We are actually the same, Genetically we are all literally the same species. Our physical traits are an adaptation our ancestors had have to be able to survive.
That got me wondering about plastic surgeries. I thought about our constant effort to look a certain way
Why do we all try to look different than we actually are?
Why are we never satisfied with our looks? We never accept the fact that our every trait is beautiful.
Different parts of the world have different cultures, styles, make-up, traditions. Even the food we eat is different.
It is important in any situation that problems get addressed.
Over the past few years. There have been many instances. African Americans were wrongfully fatally shot African Americans were beaten by police without probable cause.
We need to have a balance between talking about racism and raising awareness. We should not talk about racism to the point of causing unnecessary tension.
The video I chose to respond to is "Are Sports Inherently Racist?"
I'm sure anyone could play. I'm sure anyone could get good at any sport. Our athletic abilities have a lot to do with our genes.
Race plays a part in sports. It is also a cultural thing.
Basketball is a common sport in the south. It is played mostly by black people. There are mostly black people living there.
In the United States, too often you turn on the television, radio, Internet and hear about riots, protests, and deaths as a result of racial issues.
People are uncomfortable talking about race. They do not want to offend anyone.
We should celebrate our differences. We should speak about them openly. We can better understand each other. Our attitudes about race will shift.
f we are educated on race, we will be more inclined to stand up for equality when we hear racial comments.
I am a junior in college. This is the first time I have taken a class on racial relations. That is absurd.
Much of the population has not grown up in a society. Where talking about race freely was the norm. We often brush our questions regarding race under the rug.
I believe we need to ask questions. That will lead to more knowledge.
I do agree with you on the discussion of race.
Topics among people should always be discussed with a large group.
I agree with your statement. It seems that so many people are closed minded. It's true.
Many do not listen to others. It makes it seem almost overwhelming with how much discussion is going on without the intent of learning. Instead, many have the intent of winning an argument.
I picked this video. I never knew humans are 99.9% the same.
He explains the reason why some people have these different features. We have adapted over time to different climates.
At the end of his demonstration, he reminds us that these differences only make up .01% of us.
I found this to be very intriguing. The DNA test isolates certain genes that only exist in certain parts of the world. If they are found in your DNA, they will show up on your test.
I thought this was a very interesting topic as well.
I would think that their features would eventually change after few generations of living in the US. Their features adapt to the new climate.
I think that normal noses are based on social norms.
The person with the larger nose probably is from somewhere different. Larger noses are normal to them.
There is a reason. Sitcoms use interracial relationships as comedic relief.
They give off this vibe of awkwardness to me that comes from the fact that in todays world it is wrong we pick out interracial relationships in a matter of seconds all the time
It is something we mostly all pick up on. We never talk about it. That makes us uncomfortable.
Sam analyzes every little detail. Able to identify people based on traits. Apecific to certain regions ethnicities.
One example, the KKK rallying in Charlottesville is alarming to me. They protest about white supremacy.
Therefore, those who are trying to make the argument that their one group is better than another is left with an invalid argument.
I think it is clear. All humans are created the same.
I can confidently say that I know people of almost every race that are rich, poor, upper class, lower class, smart, dumb, gay, straight, male, female, religious, nonreligious, democrat, republican. The list goes on.
Their race has nothing to do with their place in society.
I can't get over the fact that our world is still struggling with race-related issues.
Hi Dan. I feel like your perspective is very interesting. It comes from a complete opposite place from me.
For international students verses United States students I can usually tell. Not from looks more from clothing, mannerisms, and obviously if they have an accent.
My understanding of china is to me it seems just like any other country. This understanding means I really don't have a great understanding of it.
This week, I am responding to a video from Day 2 entitled Evolution in Sociology (link below).
Knowing that all humans have 99.9% of the same genetic makeup means knowing that there is not a single race that is superior to another.
This is an upsetting thought. It's the truth.
Taking a look at movies/ magazines/ other media, we see mostly white people.
I really don't think. This should be surprising. Really unbelievable.
Discussing race is always going to have that bad connotation with it.
Focusing on the future of America is all that we can do.
race will always be a big deal
We have to work towards something. it is toward getting the focus on the positives over the negatives.
I'm sure it's unique. People who aren't from here come experience this big racial topic in America. They aren't used to  having these different groups together.
By embracing these differences and celebrating the fact that all of these ethnically different people can coincide. We show off our dominance.
I have a large and very close knit family. The smell of chicken soup is almost always permeating throughout my home. I went to an overnight summer camp for seven weeks for the last ten summers of my life. I have gathered that this is something overwhelmingly specific to Jewish families in the North East.
Truthfully, I have never given religion a chance.
I never thought these stories had any semblance of truth.
For example, the Torah portion I read to become a Bat-Mitzvah was Noah's Ark. I never consider that Noah could have lived to be 950 years old. In my eyes, that was completely impossible.
It seems like the discussion of equality has spiked dramatically since our generation spoke out. In reality the idea of equality is just being redefined.
Most races, generations, and other groups have their own ideas of equality. Equality should mean equal. We often treat the word "equality" to mean balanced with the idea of equality.
An example, today we believe slavery is a prime example of the inequalities between races. At the time, white people believed that they had the right correct balance of rights.
By a click of a button, an opinion on race equality can be shared with the world. News corporations have more power over the people than ever.
No doubt that both groups are being noticed. They are going to use modern outlets to try to increase their rights. They will fight on their idea of a fair balance.
Some countries have already come to an agreement on their idea of race equality. Their people may not understand why Americans are always trying to redefine race equality.
In the video that I chose, Professor Richards acknowledges widespread discussions. They constantly go on throughout society. They are regarding different ethnic groups.
It is very obvious that in the United States, there are lingering diversity issues that are not always addressed.
During lecture, Mr. Richards claims that some people might not think there is a race problem. They personally have not talked about it.
It's easy to identify difficulties by analyzing behaviors. Or contrasting our racial issues to other nations. These are things that should be done verbally
Mr. Richards uses the example of an American visiting Colombia. The citizens there may not believe there is a race problem.
People claim that we should stop talking about race. We should just move on from it. We can't move forward. The matter isn't solved.
Showing an acceptance/ embracement of diversity through discussions will put us in the right direction towards solving it.
We should try to acknowledge varying prospectives in race. Come together to all jointly have a positive outlook towards diversification.
We are in an America that claims to give equal rights to everyone. There is not really equality.
Someone is always going to feel superior to others.
This was a very fascinating topic to think about. That was a very fascinating topic for me as well.
I am shocked that this is not taught in schools earlier. I believe that it should be taught in schools earlier.
It being true will prevent a lot of racist thoughts from happening in the future.
Race was talked about a lot in my town. I believe it needed to be addressed even more.
It needs to be addressed in an informative matter. Coming from a different place, does not mean that they are less than you.
I think that this problem extends well beyond the classroom too.
People do this. They know that posting rude things does not result in immediate repercussions. Saying them in person does.
depends on the situation
I think that it should be talked about. A problem arises. Race is thought to be a factor.
I think that people excessively attempt to apply race to a situation that it shouldnt be.
People apply race to situations. They create race problems where there isn't any.
America itself has had many problems with race, from Native Americans to foreigners to religion.
Race should only be brought up. Wwhen it was a factor in the first place act on it. Some things are a shame like hate crime.
We shouldn't apply race to every situation involving people from different racial backgrounds.
Similar characteristics that separated say people of Italian descent from English descent separate people of African descent.
Originally I expected this venture to be more of a lesson in identifying people. The way Sam lead it was perhaps way more impactful.
Meeting including interacting with people is another gateway to this. Really noticing the small things about the way people look. Linking that with their ancestry gives us a tool to better understand the slight differences among us. The reason why we have them to begin with.
Sam made me more aware of the evolutionary differences we have thanks to our ancestry,. I really think it would be worthwhile to get to the point he is at. You can look at people. You can see where they are from. to have an idea of their lineage before asking about it.
Individuals, an example being Richard Spencer, spend their time traveling around. speaking with communities. They say white people are above all other races. This gives them the upper hand to dominate society.
This particular sociology 119 lecture brought to light the ignorance of common people. One such person is Richard Spencer.
The ideology these men carry with them is biologically inaccurate.
Scientists/ psychologists have devoted countless years of their lives to study the human mind/ consciousness.
Evidence supports the conclusion that human beings are fundamentally ninety-nine percent the same. They share the same thought processes.
After viewing photos of starving children in Africa or homeless families in India. It is a natural instinct for people to assume that they are not equal to populations like that.
The photo's are not in society's face like the one's from third world countries are. That does not mean they are not present.
I believe that more people need to discuss the fact that human beings are fundamentally the same.
Sam dug up his ancestry. He learned he is one percent Sub Saharan African.
I am confident. Racist individuals like Richard Spencer would be stunned to learn that he most likely has a sliver of African DNA.
Feelings of superiority could be diminished if society would take the time to educate themselves on their own background and the background of others. Hhumans are more alike than most people are aware of.
Sam put up images of individuals. They had similar appearances.
He asked the class to differentiate. Native American is nothing like Siberian, Native American Chinese do not agree with Chinese and European.
I don't know that it is really that hard to tell the difference.
People migrated across the earth. Some people stayed in one area. Others continued to new regions.
This means that people from varying geographical locations share the same DNA.
The way this class was structured was fantastic.
It showed that people really do not know what people of different ethnicities look like.
When students were not able to differentiate between people of different origins, this was shown in class.
Most people would probably think it would be very easy to tell the difference. A lot of people in class got this wrong.
It all made so much sense. He pulled up the map. He showed the migration patterns.
He talked through the example. He showed the arrows, which explained why people from some areas look so similar.
Thinking about this in relation to the activity. Where Sam had the guy group. People based on appearance.
Thinking about it now, knowing that entire ethnic groups can look similar makes this task seem even harder.
I think this activity would be beneficial for most people to be a part of.
I think it displays the point very well. People are all, in fact, just people. Peoples' differences are just in the DNA.
Treat people who may be different than you as humans instead of animals. It will help lead to problem solving It will lead to and understanding.
This leads to the point that exposing people to other ethnically different people at a young age can help with this.
I was from a smaller community. I was from a white community. My city was very diverse.
Once I got out of my neighborhood I was able to interact with many other different races. I grew accustomed to the traditions of other different races.
I think there is always going to be a difference between races. Education on understanding differences help decrease that gap.
I completely agree with what you said in your post.
I am aware that it is important to watch the news daily to stay in tuned with what is going on in the world. however I rarely turn on the news. I know many of my friends rarely watch the news either because its never on at my apartment.
That may be a result of how convenient it is to just find out what is going on via social media today.
It goes along with the saying agree to disagree.
In this circumstance, Hayden was extremely brave. vHe voiced his opinion in a respectful matter in front of a huge audience of students.
Hopefully, Sam pointing out that student's opinions like Hayden need to be respected. Stops something like that from happening in the future. Because social media platforms like Twitter can be extremely beneficial for engagement, especially in this class.
I think it is important to discuss it more openly. We can grow in mutual respect. We can learn from one another.
I think that not talking about race only makes the problem worse.
Nevertheless, race should continue to be discussed.
It is important to acknowledge all races
I found this part of class to be very interesting too.
Evolution is about survival of the fittest. The fact that there are many different races existing today means that we were all fit to survive. We all evolved equally.
When you first go there, all of the roads might look the same. It might be easy to get lost.
I probably would have guessed that Jeffton was of African descent. He's actually from Haiti.
I think where I was from, people were typically grouped into a few select groups; white, African(American), Asian, or Hispanic.
Though, those groups are broad out there. They definitely fail to capture everybody. Classify them accurately.
One point that I would like to mention is that people tend to speak their minds more over the internet than in person.
In class, Dr. Richards brought up the point that people tend to shy away from fully expressing themselves. When they are in the presence of people who they are not fully acquainted with. Or a vast majority of people.
I come from Mexico, a really small town. Everyone down there looks just like me.
Stereotypes do exist.
The majority of people that have the power are mostly white.
I was only 25 minutes outside a city. The city was one of the most diverse cities in America. The town that I grew up in was very far from diverse.
I believe that my graduating class was 96% caucasian.
I had to guess a month ago. The difference between native Chinese and American Chinese would be dialect and voice. Now I know that the distinguishing factors are more cultural and based off of style.
I got inspired with a fact. Mixed raes are the future.
exposed to diversity
To accept our differences, we have to educate ourselves of such.
I completely relate to how you feel about gaining knowledge in something that you feel passionate about. I don't want to get caught up in what your final grade is on a big exam either.
Sams lecture is definitely relatable. Hopefully opened the eyes of some students. To be motivated to major in a subject that they value.
It's extremely hard though. It is such a difficult topic to discuss. Everyone has their own opinions on it.
An example: take someone who grew up in a small town in the middle of nowhere.
That person is going to have grown up being influenced by the people they were surrounded by.
You look at a lot of people who grow up in small secluded areas in the United States. Not too many of them ever leave that area.
They are born and raised there. Then they settle down there.
I speculate that a lot of the prejudice comes from familiarity.
You are an employer with two applicants of similar qualifications. One is black. The other is white.
How do we fix this issue?
I found this to be very interesting too.
It is something unique. It is a direct result of your ancestors.
I am open to admitting my own ignorance. This is definitely a portrayal of mine.
Being completely honest, I never took the time to genuinely notice facial features of people who are a different race than me.
Sam has a keen interest in noses. I think it's cool to view how noses evolved in different ethnicities.
I very much like what you said. As a nation we hold ignorance. I believe that we have a lot of misconceptions about other nations. This is formed purely out of ignorance.
Through these tools, capitalism has been allowed to enter the realm of opinion.
Those with favorable opinions will be encouraged to exist. Those with unfavorable opinions will be rejected outright by the average consumer base.
This could result in the creation of life. An echo chamber in the desert. The majority opinion will be voiced.
To those true seekers of knowledge out there. Social media will present an environment of constant challenge and debate. Making the educational experience one which constantly tests the foundation of ones belief structures.
I found this part of class to be very interesting. I would completely agree with an idea about discussions of race. There is a lack of discussion about race in grade school.
I had always thought about how awesome it is. There are accents everywhere. I've wanted one most of my life.
My Penn State friends have pointed out to me how I say certain phrases unknown to them. My dialect is sometimes very different than theirs.
I am from North Jersey. The majority of my friends live right outside of Philly.
It is intriguing that different places have different dialects. This is due to the people they are surrounded by. This is due to how much they venture.
I have started to pay closer attention to my friends appearance and their ancestry. It is fascinating
I have never travelled outside of the country besides to Cancun in Mexico. I have been to many states in the U.S. where cultures are different.
I have family in Minnesota/ Washington. My best friend at Penn State is from San Diego, California.
The final thing that Sam went over was his own DNA test. Showing the regions were his DNA meets the unique gene markers.
The fact that the gene markers for Africa is so prevalent that it survived thousands of years to be detected by a simple DNA test.
Being American, I do not necessarily think that America is the great country in the world.
There isn't one particular country that trumps the rest.
I found the reasoning behind the different accents fascinating. The way language is such a dynamic entity is fascinating.
He explains that people did not travel very far. Accents were slowly passed on to other people. It made me question why the accent would change.
I wonder why people developed different languages. Language is passed down.
I have never really thought about it before.
I have never actually thought about it in this perspective before.
The video that I'm doing my response on is the Mixed Races are the Future video. I will link it in the post.
single day before
I am someone who wasn't born in this country. I felt like I could always relate to and be friends with people who weren't necessarily 100% American or 100% white American. We had something in common.
This out look is what I hope everyone has
I believe that a person shouldn't decide to not have relations with another person solely due to their background.
You are only restricting yourself by only dating someone from your own ethnicity.
I think the millennials in America has been making great strides towards acceptance.
On a national scale, race is discussed. Race is a very heated topic.
There is rarely talk about two races ever getting along.
Another big problem is that whenever something bad happens a lot of times people try to make it into a race issue. tTat makes the situation more heated.
There is still a lot of racism in America. I do not think it will go away any time soon.
I think we were making great progress with fighting racism . Now media is so prominent in everyday life. I believe the negativity travels quicker. This causes the racism to spread extremely quickly.
I believe we need to discuss race under a better light in this country. I think that will help lower racial tensions/ bring us together.
People of any religion, race or sexuality can be terrorists. Sam shows that through his examples. From ISIS, to the white man show shot up a church of black Americans.
Additionally, one thing that really hit home was the map of hate groups in each state.
After class, I looked more into it. I found that New Jersey was in the top five of the states for hate groups.
There was another thing that kind of frustrated me from Sam's class. There was a man who was a Jehovah's Witness. He did not go to his daughter's marriage.
I cannot imagine how terrible his daughter felt. It was her big day. Her father did not go.
He said this. It stood out to me. He views academia the way it should be seen.
Applying to college. It's as if the only thing that really matters is what the admissions office sees on your transcripts and essays.
I chose this clip. It's something I can relate to very well.
My biggest takeaway message from this clip was that its okay to go against the odds. It's okay to break away from the norm. It's okay to take your own path.
My mothers side of the family originated from Sicily, Italy. Growing up in that environment admittedly made me very narrow-minded. It wasn't until high school where I finally was exposed to another race, other than Italian.
My family strictly follows Italian traditions. We strictly judge other people who are not Italian.
different way then them
I believe god to be a creator of life. He doesn't interfere with the natural laws.
This belief is called deism.
Something that I don't agree with is how people differentiate religions/ faiths.
Every religion moves towards making up someone's identity. Every religion helps to lead a happy life in unity no matter what beliefs they follow.
There is no point in discriminating or imposing superiority
However, when it comes to relationships I don't think race should be an issue.
I think that being able to understand someone else's culture is the most beautiful thing.
In a way, I feel like dating someone out of your race can be a way to end racism.
I know we will be talking about very real social issues in Soc 119. They can sometimes be hard to discuss.
people were attackinG
During this discussion, Sam mentions how sports could be a cultural phenomenon. A result of different body builds from different parts of the country that inhabit people of different skin colors.
I believe this is very true.
In many parts of Ethiopia, there are people struggling to provide food. Feed themselves, their families, let alone purchase anything remotely unnecessary.
Yes, I believe some of the athletics is due to body build/type. I think a lot of it comes from economics.
In the world we live in today, I think people are very cautious of what they say. They are worried they are going to be judged based on their thoughts/ opinions.
I think this is a very interesting topic.
I think I had lots of experience with different beliefs/ religions.
I view religion. It is a way to seek help. People are in the worst situation of their own.
I agree with what you are saying here!
I find it fascinating to learn that many of our facial features come from our different ancestors.
I agree with you that it's very empowering to know this. Without all of our different features our ancestors wouldn't have survived.
I completely agree with you that race is talked about too much. Race is not talked about enough in different situations.
It should be embraced. It should be spoken about.
I really liked how you brought up the fact that people do not fight over other peoples differences in hair color. For some reason the color of their skin changes their whole perspective on things.
I agree. The idea of white supremacy is a huge social issue right now.
We, human beings, are more alike than anyone realizes.
Just what Amanda said in her reply to your post, Ma. I too was about to be angry at your response. As you continued into the second and third sentences, my views changed. I understood where you were going with your thoughts.
Saying we do too much talking and not enough doing honestly gave me chills because it is true.
I don't think that anyone knows how to do that. I don't know. Is it possible?
I wish
I thank you. You brought to light the same questions I think to myself about racism.
I realized something from this class like you did. Those who think differently than the two of us have their own reasoning.
In the video, I was shocked Sam touched on race. Realization that the most evolved species (all the way to the right). The evolution diagram was in fact, white.
Every race believes they are the superior race. This is why all of the disconnect/ hateful nature come into play.
country is still plagued
This coincides with the mass genocide the migrants from Europeinflicted on the Native Americans in the United States.
However, I think the ability to understand and empathize with other cultures and religions. Is stagnating in the United States. Due to the fact that our country was built on the foundation of inequality, as stated in the video.
I think there are too many cultures and opinions today for the government to accommodate everyone. Until the moment the U.Sgovernment takes actionand reverts tradition. To appeal to the changing times of this new technological era.
In sports, often a region or nations reputation is held up by the performance of only a few very talented individuals.
These athletes are quite literally the exceptional. Their athleticism puts them above the rank. They are analyzed by others to see how that talent can be developed.
It is easy to look at a roster on the NBA. The obvious trait that well over half of the players are dark skinned.
Outside the cultural outlets leading them to that sport, it could be possible that there are other less noticed traits leading them to the top.
It was brought up. The answer seemed quite obvious to me.
The United States, since the beginning, had been a country which held large amounts of slaves.
saw themselves as
Slavery was more popular in the south part of the United States. There is more racism in the south than in the north.
These types of people all have white skin. They were not considered white to the Americans living in the United States.
I can personally connect to this. My grandparents were born in Poland. They moved to the United States around the 1950s.
grandparents decision
Now that Polish and Irish people are considered white people and are less stereotyped. She wished that she could have embraced her heritage more.
Prior to this video was the activity. One student had to try to place a bunch of mixed race students into groups of similar backgrounds.
These students volunteered. They knew that their background was very hard to guess.
I thought that this was the most interesting/ entertaining activity shown.
I was impressed how close the student actually was with placing the other students.
In this video, Sam showed two girls that the student placed together. The two had very significant differences.
I find this very interesting. I think it needs to be more known. Most people now have mixed races. It is important to know that just because two people have the same color skin, it does not mean they have the same race or background.
I know that personally I would have been very bad at this activity. I am not educated in anything talked about in this video.
He mentions that people of the same race will be able to tell that they are the same.
I do understand. I agree with your point.
I think some of these characteristics are seen as abnormal, because many European features are seen as more of the norm.
We live in America. More of the minorities features are considered abnormal.
I found this lecture to be very interesting. I never knew that noses were very distinct from each other.
When he described the purposes of eack kind of nose, I was very surprised.
I honestly thought. That a nose was just a nose. All it did was really help for our sense of smell.
Sam brought up Manan. I did not know that his type of nose had a specific purpose.
In a colder climate, his longer nose is able to have some more time to warm the air. Than it hits the lungs.
phenotypic differences
suggests that the individual
In my opinion, it is this kind of thinking that is limiting certain individuals. Groups of people from the same access others have.
We talk about why some sports seem to be mostly made up of a certain race.
This is an interesting question. I think it has multiple aspects. Each aspect can have an impact.
Anybody is allowed. They play any sport.
There is some information to support the idea. The physical aspects affect the difference of the two sports. I think most of the difference comes from the culture that different races grow up in.
In class we used the example of what type of posters do kids have in their rooms.
This is an interesting topic. I had never thought about in this way.
Everyone I know has a mixed background. It leads to people looking different. it leads to people having similar characteristics depending on their genes
Sam was describing how he can look at differences in people in other countries like Haiti. I realized that it is something we can all relate to. Most people I know that have Irish blood usually have freckles, like myself, my friends, including family.
This compared to a basketball that costs at the most 30 dollars.
Socioeconomics has a lot to do with what sports people play growing up.
In baseball, I wanted to play 1st base. I batted left handed. I wanted to be like my favorite player on the Phillies, Jim Thome.
My point is that we look up to people that we can identify with.
There are not many people in northeast Philadelphia that would be able to afford hockey equipment. A lot of people look up to people that they can identify with.
Where one grows up has a tremendous impact in their focuses in life.
It makes sense. Don't get me wrong. Sam can tell what part of the world a person comes from with enough accuracy to be impressive. Looking at a particular facial feature is all types of wild.
This could definitely be my conspiracy theorist Mr. Hyde showing.
Assume that Sam is being one hundred percent legitimate. This is an incredibly cool concept. Even without knowing ones ancestry, much can still be gleaned from using only a visual standpoint.
I agree with a lot of what you are saying.
The Bible in my opinion is taken way to seriously. People internalize everything in it. They try to implement everything in it.
I'm sure that was not the purpose behind it.
I think the bible should be treated the same way.
Take the good messages out. Leave the rest.
Don't just do everything it says.
This is nothing that makes people better at one sport versus another.
This difference could help. These sports are played in the different climates.
You need to be adaptable to cold are if you play hockey and the opposite for basketball.
Basketball was created to have an indoor sport to stay in shape during the warmer months.
There is no geographical favoritism for this sport. I am not sure how this could have effected the demographics of the sport.
I found something interesting in class. Someone brought up was the socioeconomics related the sports.
Now I am not agreeing 100% that this is the case for the demographic differences. This is something that my dad brought up to me once. Even though looking back now, I know he is not the most racially accepting person.
I think that. Using social media in a class of this size is beneficial. It gives everyone a voice.
I think that as the semester progresses, everyone in the class will become more comfortable speaking about their beliefs. And will begin to understand that there are going to be disagreements within the class.
Sam says that his main goal in the class is not to impose his own opinions on us. It's to help make us think, formulate our own opinions.
class is really
developed to categorize things
I feel like as a whole, our society can get too hung up on peoples differences. Getting hung up on people's differences makes it very challenging to see past them.
Here, Sam tells us to start noticing them more.
Picking out every single little difference between ourselves/ any other person can start to get mean/ nasty.
I'm from Boston. Sometimes my accent really becomes apparent.
When the word wicked slips out into conversation, most people will say oh that's cool. You must be from Massachusetts!
It's never in a rude way. It's never in a belittling way. It's more a topic of conversation that others want to start to get to know me better.
Coming to Penn State from Boston has been a change in scenery/ culture.
I am meeting all new types of people. I am seeing more hils. There is the most open space I've honestly ever seen before. I am living in a state I've never been to prior to applying to PSU.
I was never thinking about the money issue. Until that one student said it. It did almost make sense. Then you mentioned football.
It made me think about how a lot of white people play soccer. That requires very little equipment.
I believe that sports are not a racist thing.
I believe people play sports for just two reasons.
I have a lot of tall white friends. They play basketball.
This discussion was very interesting. Your response was very good. It made me think a lot.
In addition, there so much more to every country and culture. I end up thinking that if we were open to learning about other countries. This can even be a solution for the problems that we have faced throughout history.
Hi Morgan. I found it incredibly interesting. The source of a lot of discrimination came from an issue related to proximity to a line on our planet.
I agree with your analyzation of why we don't date outside of our race or what we are used to.
Differences do not mean that we have a right to treat anyone maliciously. They should be embraced. They should be acknowledged.
I really agree with your point to talk about race more often.
In Sam's class we have been talking about race. Sam has been educating us on different races around the world.
I am going to protest this class.
I agree with you on your point to stop being colorblind to race.
You are absolutely right. Race will never go away. Race is ignored.
It is a blessing that we can live in this country. This country has much diversity mixed together.
Unfortunately, there are still those who find a problem with this. They lash out at races as a whole with ideas that are off base.
Throughout history, humans have been discriminating against different races/ nationalities.
We are in a melting pot. This brings several different races together in all types of environments.
It feels fresh in the mind of America. It has never been properly addressed by the nation.
I definitely agree with that statement. We do not pay enough. Attention to detail.
People also always look at me and assume I'm only Italian. I'm actually half Puerto Rican.
From the clip, this is most likely my favorite qoute from Sam. I disagree.
The downside to giving all students access to the same open forum is the sense of anonymity.
Each person's name is usually on their Twitter. In a room with over 700 students, you can safely post anything and get away with it.
It is reasonable to expect a classroom to have better etiquette than this. My belief is that there exists no classroom with 700 plus students that can use twitter, or any form of social media honorably. A few people bringing each other down.
Looking around 100 Thomas. I saw a sea of different faces, ethnicities, races,etc.
Last semester, every single class I was enrolled in was in 100 Thomas.
I jokingly asked if advisors recommended this class for International students since they have such a presence.
Numerous people agreed. They made the same remark. They said how they experienced the same thing.
We all discussed how they looked at their different classes. They never noticed the difference between International students and U.S. students. They only noticed if they spoke a different language or had an accent.
I honestly do not know the difference between to the two before this class.
We see too often riots occurring in cities. Race issues are blown up exponentially by the media.
Everyone had their own opinion. The opinions that are being formed are becoming too radical. They are dividing the country down the middle.
He rebelled against his strict Catholic upbringing. He developed a strong distrust of religious institutions. He tried to pass it on to my sisters and I.
I have never identified with any particular religion. I have tried to learn as much as I can about all religions. I practice meditation and mindfulness. I do this to foster my sense of connection to life and the universe.
Along the way I have a found a community of open-minded people. Many of them have different religious beliefs.
We are all connected. We have faith in something bigger than ourselves.
I know that I believe in evolution.
I heard Sam say that he has talked to God and then a minute later say that he does not believe in God. It made me feel like I am not the only person whose beliefs seem to contradict themselves.
I think your post is very important. We have adapted to different climates. Our bodies have changes.
Many east Asian people have mono lids. They may have been part of an adaptation. He explained that they were merely spread throughout the culture. It was a trait that people liked. reproduced through breeding.
Other than that, you post is spot on.
One of the main reasons being I was an important part of this experiment when it was brought up in class.
It was definitely fun. It was quite an experience. You're in front of more than 700 people. They're all watching you.
It's true when they say appearances are deceptive. Don't judge a book by it's cover.
I think the student did an exceptional job to a certain extent. He divided people into race groups based on certain external features, from his perspective.
Thus, this was a very interesting way to learn about mixed races. It gave a completely different perspective.
Nevertheless, people should not forget all the racists acts that happened in the past. Address these issues in order to move forward. Make sure the closed- minded mentalities are being demolished as the world moves forward.
I agree. I would be surprised seeing a black or Asian male or female on the right end of an evolution chart.
Knowing this ideology changes things. It makes it impossible to think that one group is scientifically better than another group. The hardest part is to get people to understand.
This ties back to the media influence depicting white people.
This is something that over the years I have found to be very true in terms of social media.
You do not need to deal with the immediate response. Look in the person's eyes.
I am the type of person who excels in face-to-face conversation. I am comfortable having a normal conversation. I do not feel like I need to use social media as a shield to put others down.
This lesson shocked me so much. I always knew that these people existed. I saw so many of them come together in big numbers. The rally in Charlottesville disgusted me.
You would have to live under a rock. Otherwise you'd see that there are plenty of injustices. They take place all over this great nation.
I have never experienced racism towards me. I couldn't possibly understand or say I know how he feels.
Race is such a huge topic in the US I believe that is because of how diverse the country is.
We can't continue to turn a blind eye. Things will get worse and worse.
In the video, Arsh says that the Indian Government admitted their wrongdoings. They tried to rebuild the relationship between those affected.
I believe if we want to make headway on this race issue our government needs to do the same.
It was mentioned in other responses. I felt personally attacked. The idea that Americans are trying to get it right.
Then I got to thinking. Why do people take actual offense from a simple misnomer? Being misconstrued as another race is insulting.
Following this slide, a picture of four black NBA icons is shown.
Why do we categorize races in relation to athletics?
Is it culture like Sam says?
Growing up, I participated in soccer.
Soccer is a dominant sport in countries throughout Africa. This could be argued to be cultural. It is a configuration of value that is learned socially in these areas.
To me, it seems as if culture is undeniably seen as racist. This is the case whether it is intentional or not.
Prior to coming college, I had never really hadheard racist remarks before.
It really disgusted me. I heard a student freely drop the N word last year.
I agree with you. Race is frequently talked about on the news.
It has to be in order for people's messages to be heard.
I personally don't think its discussed enough though.
I don't think people actually realize including myself how big of an issue it really is.
If you have lived in the same area all your life, how do you know how other places and people behave.
I think people need to step out of their bubble. They will realize how other people are treated.
As we mature into adulthood we increase our knowledge and our understanding about this subject.
It becomes clearer that groups of people are suppressed. Nothing can be done unless the issue is put under the spotlight.
Many factors can influence the process. That is why there exists both similar and completely different cultures around the world.
By factors I mean the location, climate, genetics, etc.
In my view, this process of originating and consolidating cultures is no longer possible because of technology and globalization.
Many traditions are being lost. People think and do things is getting more similar as time goes by.
It's much more common to find people from different cultures in the same place. Like here at Penn State
On the other hand, genetics is something that cannot be changed by technology.
I found the video really interesting. One can notice how experienced Sam  is about these kinds of topics.
If I had to do the exercise, I would have failed tremendously.
The person that did it, did a great job doing the exercise without offending anyone.
This exercise and lecture was one of my favorites so far. It allowed me and everyone else to see that a group of people can look very similar and be from very different parts of the world.
Dr. Richards explained that two key events in American history have resulted in race having such a controversial and important role in today's American society.
It was  surprising. There are 556 Native American tribes recognized by the Federal Government.
Native Americans are often left unrecognized. Native Americans do not have a very prominent voice.
I find it very unfortunate. We do not hear more concerning the struggles of Native Americans.
This being said, there are definetly some atrocious events. They tarnish the reputation of this country.
I would like to disagree with the student who compared India to the United States.
I believe in recent times this country has become more polarized. It's especially so due to last years election.
Groups of races often try to place the blame of problems on each other.
It is important to gain perspective and knowledge on both sides of the argument. In order to understand the groups.
America is perhaps the most diverse nation in the world. Issues are going to present themselves.
However, many people in all race groups are very stubborn. They are very rooted in their beliefs. They don't even consider the other side. They resort to violence to prove their point.
Leaders of all the races have to work together. They must mediate the racial issues we face.
I think that in America we are taught to say African American. It is the most correct.
I wonder how this terminology comes across to individuals.
I really liked the comparison you used about Thailand/ Japan.
It is a little bit extreme. I think it really brings the point across.
You also talked about not noticing. There are differentiating features of black people.
The way Sam compared their features made the differences really stand out.
It made me want to look at myself in a mirror. I wanted to see what distinguishes me as an African American.
It is a huge part of our nations history. It is important to discuss the problem. This is in order to prevent it from happening in the future.
Sam also mentioned how there are many critics that suggested that Americans talk about racism too much. Yet many people may think otherwise.
He said that there are two types of people when it comes to talking about racism.
There are those that think we talk about it excessively. There are those that believe we don't talk about it nearly enough.
We should continue to educate people on our nations history. Then history will not repeat itself.
I was eager to discuss this issue in lecture. I do think racism is still around this nation. It is constantly a problem for many people.
Humans tend to become stereotypical. That is completely normal.
Most people come from backgrounds that consider their tribe or color for example to be more superior than others.
I think people should keep an open mind about races. They should try to judge people based on their effort. They should not judge by looks or race.
One discussion during class sparked my interest. There was discussion about why race is still an issue in the United States. This is opposed to other countries.
In the video, one student spoke on the microphone. They explained that we are constantly changing how we view race. This I agree with.
I think that race is still a very prominent problem in the United States.
I think that our current political leaders contribute to an inappropriate and non- progressive dialogue between white and black people.
With these things still happening even after our country was founded on these prejudices.
I think that opening up a dialogue about race/ directly addressing it can help the US to make progress.
Your experience on this subject is cool. It's startling how different it was from mine growing up.
I'm one of those people that had mostly not interacted with people of other races, in school mainly. Not until I was in college.
I am white. I grew up in a rural area of Pennsylvania.
My high school was small. There were probably about 6 people in my graduating class that were not white.
It's definitely just where you grow up that shapes your experiences.
On the subject of mixed race It is comforting that the population of America is increasingly mixed. This seems to me like it is a big marker of the changing attitudes on interracial relationships.
Your stance on weather being a factor was a very interesting take.
It's true that basketball courts are very common in warmer places. Warm weather means more people being active outside.
In today's age, I feel that indoor hockey arenas are much more common than outdoor rinks.
Everyone of my friends who plays or have played hockey before. Said it was always a rare occasion playing at an outside arena.
I feel that the main difference is that hockey arenas take up a lot of space.
When you drive through a city there are going to be 10 outdoor basketball hoops scattered everywhere. Compared to maybe one hockey arena or outdoor skating rink.
This is on the lines of what Hayden was talking about in class.
Convincing arguments can be made for both sides. There is no clear answer.
Others believe that the discussion is unavoidable. By talking about race, we become more comfortable and openminded.
In countries such as India, there is little talk about race. There is in the United States.
In other countries, sometimes the problems associated with race are not acknowledged as much. This is because of the lack of these conversations about race.
there is a debate in the United States over whether we talk too much about race. It is such a complex and detailed subject. It seems overwhelming at times.
Just 19% think the level of discussion of racial issues is about right.
It is important to educate younger generations. They can understand that it is not about what a person looks like. How a person acts is how a person is defined.
It puts down the other minorities. It is saying that Asian Americans are able to live the American dreams. It's saying other minorities are slacking.
To educate yourself on something such as history could very well enable you to make at least one valid point.
Ideology consumes the heart of one's being. The individual refuses to consider their own ideas as flawed.
Furthermore, since the Russians, technically, won WWII. Should their extermination of their own citizens go unpunished. Or, no because they won?
To ensure we are free from the possession of ideas is to become surrounded by those with opposing viewpoints.
It is somehow our reasoning for why the NBA is mostly black.
Very rarely do we have people of black decent playing hockey.
I do believe genetics plays a role to an extent. I don't believe that is the full story.
Stick with hockey and basketball as the example. Think of the climate they are played in.
It is hard to play basketball outside. The ground is covered in snow/ ice sometimes.
You could conclude that basketball tends to be played in warmer climates.
Hockey is played on ice.
Things are a certain way today. It is mostly played in indoor arenas, where the ice is made.
However, before that, it had to be played somewhere that ice could be available naturally. Therefore, hockey tends to be played in cooler climates.
Hockey equipment is expensive. This is along with the travel expenses. There are not a million local hockey teams to always play.
A hockey rink needs to be rented out. It will be used by the team.
This is because so many different views and thoughts make more than enough sense when taken into consideration.
I think that what it comes down to. Is belief.
Sam Richards pointed out. People could be categorized on what they believe happened: creationists, theists, naturalistics, and atheistic.
I believe that there is indeed a God. Ultimately, he guided the process for the evolution of humans and the rest of the world.
Of course, god did not guide the process step by step, detail by detail.
Due to this, science was able to play a significant factor in the evolution of humans.
This was scientific fact that is hard to be disputed against.
I said it before. Belief plays a significant role in how the world, humans/ everything was created.
Some people don't believe. There's a god.
This would just leave it purely up to science to be responsible for evolution and the way the world has become today.
Others believe that god created us the way we are now. The believe that evolution did not exist.
I don't know about that. There is solid evidence of evolution dating back hundreds of years.
In the end, it won't matter. Differences in belief will always get in the way.
I agree with Sam Richards. This is largely in part from the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's. I also think that it comes from the fact that America was built from the institution of slavery.
There was a misconception of separate but equal, considering Jim Crow Laws. The misconception concerned education, power, and opportunity between whites and blacks. The Civil Rights Movement challenged this notion for better change.
The idea that race is a problem in society implies that discrimination is a problem in today's issues.
Some argue that police officers are abusing their authority of power. Often times targeting black people with questionable motives.
I think there would be a lot more instances of protests against police were this not the case. That would eventually lead to government intervention.
Seeing news of police officers shooting people with a subjectively lower threat. Spreads a narrative that law enforcement cannot be trusted as much anymore.
I do not see the issue of race leaving in the near future. What has happened in the news shows that more should be done. The police and government should heal the divisions of the past to serve the present.
Likewise, I found this discussion to be very interesting!
I'm also from the Boston area. There are definitely certain words and phrases I say that people here have noticed as a Boston thing. My accent is no where near as strong as some of my friends from South Jersey and Philly.
At he same time I disagree with you. Race is talked about too much.
To spread this idea of equality, I think race need to be talked about more openly.
It got me thinking. I personally have to say that I don't think sports are inherently racist.
It is simply much easier to start up a basketball game than a hockey game.
Hockey games require much more equipment, from the skates to the protective equipment. In addition to those, you need to know how to skate. Depending on the person, could be really easy or really hard to learn.
To play basketball, you only really need to know first how to run. Second you need to be able to bounce a basketball.
Obviously, some people are really uncoordinated. Generally speaking, it would be much easier to start playing basketball than to start playing hockey.
I would love to see the look on someone's face. Someone is shown this clip. They have been just how wrong for so long.
To some extent, I disagree with what you said.
I really liked this post. You said what we are all thinking.
Its not fair to any of us that we have been conditioned to tiptoe around the subjectlike this, but we are.
This video clip was definitely one of my other favorite discussions we had in class, apart from the one I talked about.
This topic was discussion caught most of my attention. I was so heavily involved with sports throughout most of my school life.
This is heavily based oncertain physical features,=. Especially their built and bone structure. Compared to most of the other people from around the world.
You raise a good point. I partially agree with you on this one.
I understand. A lot of us have experience problems like racial slurs being thrown. That is not good at all.
You raise a really good point in the question you ask. At what point will that happen?
This was such an interesting response to read!
Since coming to Penn State, I have become involved with an African American who grew up in New York.
I think its important. Know why we look the way we do.
People have their own opinion on human evolution. Parents teach their kids what they believe to be true. This is mainly from their religion.
I love how Sam can talk about it freely. I wish schools were taught to do the same. It's an interesting topic.
allow students to openly talk allowing students to be knowledgeable of this subject will help end ignorance  allowing students to be knowledgeable about this subject will help end racism
The groups I made were completely different from the groups on the stage. They were even less accurate than the inaccurate groupings in the front of the classroom.
Dr. Richards asked each of the participants about where their ancestors were from. Some of their responses really surprised me. What shocked me even more was how easy it was for Dr. Richards to recognize where people's ancestors originate from.
Dr. Richards said he found it easy. He can recognize features on a person's face. Second, he can classify where their ancestors are from. He has traveled a lot. seen a lot of people from different places.
Since this activity has occurred. I have noticed myself being less quick to guess or classify people into where I think their ancestors are from. I learned I was actually really bad at it.
I do believe that we are not born racists.
We are subconsciously telling our children and the younger generation something. We say some races are lower than us. We say because of this, there is a gap within America.
By gap, I mean that there is some sort of unwritten competition amongst all the people.
America is supposed to be the melting pot.
People are afraid to talk about race. Because it is one of those unwritten rules that one should not say.
It is important to educate the younger generation of today. The color of your skin does not define the status or the worthiness of that individual.
As a practicing Catholic, I understand the strict values. And set of beliefs that the church expects its members to follow.
Not adhering to every belief forced upon me growing up was difficult to come to terms with.
She asked me if I wanted to disprove God. I cried.
I didn't want to upset my mother. I didn't want to abandon my faith. As a scientist, I wanted to pursue truth.
I wanted to know how the universe began, how it evolved, and like every other human on this earth, I wanted to find meaning in it.
My belief system is complicated.
That was hard for me to accept. It has defined me as an individual.
I still regularly attend mass. Mass makes me want to be a better person.
I also think the disparities are greatly influenced by culture.
In class, we discussed black people. They might not have the same opportunities as white people when it comes to sports like hockey. The expense of the game is high. If black people really wanted to play hockey, they would find a way.
This immediately caught my attention. Accents fascinate me.
I am from New Jersey, and many people at school think that I have an accent.
When they say this, I look at them with a confused expression. I do not think that I have one.
In my area (Central NJ), it is exclusively called pork roll.
After watching this video. I realized that people around my county may have certain ways of saying things/words that are native to our area. Because people have been locked into our particular area. Creating a specific dialetctic.
The main objective of this video was to start looking at people deeper. The objective was to identify them as White, Black, Asian, or Hispanic.
We need to start looking at people. We need to recognize their racial features linking them to their ancestry.
At the restaurant I work at over the summer, my boss hired a new boy.
I noticed he would always look at people very intensely. I never knew why.
I had no idea how he knew this. I had never told him I was.
It amazed me that he could piece all of my facial features together and determine my ancestry.
Facial features all have a purpose. When I take this class I hope I can learn the distinctions between different backgrounds.
The video I chose to write a response on is Pay Attention to Distinct Differences.
I really liked this video. I think it is so interesting how accents, dialects, and facial features. Can help people distinguish where their ancestors are from.
I think that it is cool that by using these features, people can tell where other people are from.
It has always been obvious to me that accents/ dialects can help distinguish where people are from.
I have a lot of family from Boston, Massachusetts. I grew up around the Boston dialect. I grew up hearing my cousins use the word "wicked" to describe things. They'd pronounce car as "cah."
I have also been told that I have a slight Philly accent  I did not know I have until I got to Penn State.
I am from outside of Philly. My accent is not very strong.
My friends tell me that I pronounce family with a Philly accent.
One of my best friends is from Long Island. She has a very strong accent.
I think it is so cool. Each place has its own individual accent or dialect. Each one is unique. Each one is distinguishable to someone not from that area.
It is very interesting. This extends beyond just the boundaries of the United States.
It is one thing to be able to hear the difference in accents and dialects, both nationally and internationally.
It is intriguing to me that something as simple as the shape of someones nose can help someone figure out where their ancestors are from.
In the hot climates the hair is tightly kinked. Because it is limiting the amount of heat it absorbs while protecting the head.
I was surprised with the students comment. It was that UV radiation can impact the brain just by standing in the sun.
It now makes sense to me that where you live greatly affects everything about you like your hair/ nose/ eyes.
I was surprised. Sam mentioned that the tight kinks in hair is so the heat  The heat is reaching the head it does not reach the scalp
The difference in hair between all nationalities can be seen very clearly. By taking it a step further and seeing that it is all due to location makes sense.
This lecture proved to me that evolution created all the differences between humans. The differences were for our own protection.
The differences in climates around the world have shaped us to who we are today.
Anybody can present their personal opinions and thoughts on race into an argument. It's hard, if not impossible, to argue against facts.
Humans have evolved different traits in order to adapt to their geographical environment. However, I do believe that humans have developed societies and cultures in those environments. They are often discriminated because of their physical features for this reason.
I believe that many Alt Right group members would be shocked to find this out. They are very genetically similar to the people they hate.
I understand that race is a really big deal. It's especially so because of all of the racial injustice that has taken place in the last months.
Every time I turn on the new now a days all the stories are involving race.
I feel like it has come to be all that is talked about.
I watch ESPN. Race is a big topic that is talked about even there.
Every time I here them talking about Collin Kapernik and him taking a knee during the national anthem.
He is currently not on the team. Many seem to believe it is due to him taking a social stance.
I understand that this a topic that needs to be talked about. It feels excessive.
People have been trying to have peaceful protest regarding race. They have ended up turning violent due to backlash.
I see what Sam is saying. He talks about both sides having a really good argument.
I started to see race in my high school.
Not to mention the white people were also broken up into subcategories like drama club, nerds, ROTC, delinquent, and popular kids.
I have thought back to my behaviors in that cafeteria often.
I remember fluttering around the room to the different groups like a social butterfly.
I would always eat with my nerd friends first.
If anyone did this, please reply.
At the time, I was not even conscious I was crossing normal high school boundaries.
I loved to talk to people.
To get to know them.
I wanted to really connect with them. I wanted to let them know I cared.
I see it as time I do not have anymore.
I am always wrapped up in my own world now.
How it happened, I am not too sure. I am aware to the fact that it happened.
Personally, I want to reopen the doors to the barriers I once was blind to in high school.
I hoping SOC119 will give me the tools to be able to do this again.
I found this lecture to be very interesting. Likewise, I can relate to this topic.
I was also the first person in my family to get braces and attend private school. So I can see where we have some common ground.
One example that you pointed out was if someone's teeth are crooked or straight.
You also mentioned how Sam spoke about white supremacists. They may believe that they are a part of a more advanced race.
All of those theories can easily be dismissed due to the fact that DNA testsexist.
I can definitely understand your view. We talk about race excessively.
But I disagree with you that race issues cannot be solved by discussion and raising awareness.
Everything we learned was hard for my teacher to articulate. As she said, you will never truly understand it until you live it.
She had told us the best life lesson she could give. In order to learn the ins and outs of something, you have to completely immerse yourself in it.
My friend was in Afghanistan.
I was beyond worried for him and his dafety, and he was even worried for himself.
If we never talked about race issues, Martin Luther King would have never changed the world with his "I Have a Dream Speech". We would still have segregated bathrooms.
I've decided that I believe it is crucial we talk about race.
The times are different. We cannot change our past.
Parents today may be less racist than their parents. Children are still going to learn about their country's history. This is for good reason.
Focusing on our improvement and talking to one another like were all the same. Is completely ignoring those who are still suffering from stereotypes and violence from white supremacists.
I agree that the blunt way this discussion is led makes the class environment more open to discussion.
This class is informative. It has already taught me more than I thought it would the entire semester.
The numbers don't lie.
Like you said humans are 99.9% genetically the same.
I agree with your point. You called the United States a melting pot..
It is important to understand that America is full of people of all races. That leads to conflict.
Racism has evolved in America. Our country has changed a lot.
But its also interesting because it is an approach which can expose stereotypes.
I'm not sure why they laughed. I think she makes a very good point.
It helps white men in power to objectify women who are foreign to them. They don't try to understand who they are.
It definitely added some hardships and turbulence in our relationship that I had not experienced before.
It even led to some issues of communication. I think they unfortunately added to the eventual dissolution of our relationship.
Matt, I agree that sports aren't racist at all. It's just that people make them seem like they are.
Do you remember that student in class who was a tall, black man? Sam said that the sport he played was hockey.
People thought he played football. I think a lot of people were shocked. There's this preconceived idea that if you play a sport, you must have a certain color for it.
There's something that people don't understand about sports and skin color.
People just have this idea stuck in their head that your color must match your sport.
We justify our supremacy over other nations by depicting other countries in a state of vulnerability.
We consider European countries to be our equals. They, like us, have a large population of white people.
Most of the countries that we depict as being in a state of vulnerability and poverty are mainly nations that have a large population of people of color.
The United Arab Emirates is one of the richest nations in the world. They're far richer than the United States. There are several African countries that have a higher economic growth rate than we do.
I think Sam covered the most significant reasons for this focus on race. He mentioned the Native American genocide and slavery. We as a country have never really come to terms with either.
I think that as a whole our schools can do a better job teaching us about the full extent of slavery and genocide in the United States. They should teach it's effects on Native and African Americans.
I also think it was interesting what was said. A lot of the founding of America was tied a lot to slavery and racism. The constitution was written in a way that excluded minorities.
My grandparents immigrated to America from Italy. I know that they dealt with discrimination and racism.
This racism has been directed towards every new group of immigrants that comes to the United States. From Italians and Irish in the past. To Middle Eastern and Islamic immigrants in recent years.
She was like your Grandma. My Grandmom was raised thinking that interracial couples were not acceptable. It was the ideology of their time period.
I asked myself why I had never. I find people of color just as attractive as my own race.
Like they say, opposites attract!
By introducing incredible African American athletes into these professional sports, the leagues became much more competitive.
The first thoughts were white people were better adapted to the cold. Kenyans had naturally better cardiovascular endurance.
That is when Sam introduced the idea that different body types were the most important role in how certain cultures are more adapted to certain sports.
Here's a demographic note. Hockey used to be only a cold sport started in the north for most of its existence. This was until recently.
The opposite is true for African Americans. They lived in warm regions. A hoop and a ball, or a football, was all they needed to play.
There are all of these different ideas floating around. There are ideas about why different cultures are better at different sports. I believe it ultimately boils down to the different body types .
To be a great NBA player, one usually has to be tall/ quick.
For a hockey player, height is not a major factor. Strength and speed are.
A white person tends to have shorter legs with a longer torso.
This body type is better suited for a game like hockey. Leg strength is critical to be a fast and strong skater.
I couldn't agree more with you, Alexandrea.
I chose this video. I think that it brings up a very important topic. This is not talked about often enough in American history.
We often don't even talk about racism against Native Americans. It is an uncomfortable and embarrassing look into the racist past of America.
There are almost 600 federally recognized tribes. I can't even imagine what it would feel like to live in a country that has murdered millions of your ancestors.
This can definitely cause a feeling if disenfranchisement within the Native American community.\
I feel like there are leaps and bounds that America has to make. This would only begin to come close to solving the race problem right now. A great first step is opening a dialogue between many different communities.
The best way to hear other communities problems is simply to be willing to listen. Provide a way to voice concerns. Work together to overcome the systemic racism that we all have come to know in America
And like Sam said, no one really would venture far from there which is something just realized.
I came to college. I realized that I speak differently.
I have never been out of the United States.
I am part Italian and Irish. I resemble people from those countries in a way.
In this case, the genetics of individuals are 99.9 percent the same. This means people from a different race are born with almost the same genetics physically. How does this affect different races mentally?
Different cultures have different values. This can also impact a human's personality. For example, Asian cultures value humbleness. Western cultures value confidence.
Another part of the video, I found interesting. It was the discussion of class differences.
I agree with Professor Richards. There are class divides in America.
However, would people from a different race, income bracket, or political group agree with this statement?
Would people from a different background even take the class divide seriously?
I am from an Asian background. I found that the class divide is taken very seriously in India.
In India, there exists a caste system. People who associate with others from a lower caste are ostracized.
Reading is awesome. Can't argue with that.
It's not a bad idea to challenge the norms of our education system. There are certainly problems with things like tracking where students get lost in a sea of bureaucracy.
I'm glad that you found something positive in Sams teaching. I am personally struggling to attain something positive.
I understand where you are coming from.
Some kids are just simply not introduced to some sports. This is why it may seem that everyone in that race drifts to a certain sport.
I do agree that society puts us in a box. I think it's in a more deeper way.
Society is not just saying that black people are good at football or basketball. It's putting these opportunities into our communities.
The places that we live dictates what we are exposed to.
As you can see there wasn't a large array of sports for my classmates and myself to choose from.
On the surface it may seem like people of the same race are just good at a certain sport. In actuality it's what they are exposed to.
Exposure to one sport will cause people to be better. They practice more.
This is just the preferable body type in that sport. Sam mentioned something in the video. Anyone can mostly achieve that body through training.
If you start to take a deeper look into this topic you'll eventually start to think about culture. You might think about why the sports are so popular with these groups, discounting body type.
To play hockey, you need a stick, a puck, a goal, skates, pads, a rink to play on, rink time, etc.
I was expecting her to say an answer. I expected completely the opposite of what she said.
I personally believe this. It's rare for a white man to like a black woman.
I think we tend to intimidate them. We aren't approachable to most of them.
Ive heard that in other countries black women are more appreciated by men of other races than here in America.
So I believe her answer maybe could have worked. If we were speaking of white men specific to some other countries.
In my 20 years Ive only had two white guys ever show interest in me.
I could possibly encounter a guy of another race that completely changes my perspective on the topic. As of now, an interracial relationship would not be something for me.
With the direction our country is going, I find it very difficult to not assume how most white people feel about black women and men.
I'm not saying this mentality is at all right. Not all people are the same.
To avoid all of that, I choose to avoid dating outside of my race.
These things are the reason why we have classes/ castes.
Another example relates to this. There was a genocide that occurred during the Holocaust.
The Nazis believed that blonde hair/ blue eyes were the superior qualities of the master race.
Looks should not define your class. Internally, we are essentially the same creatures.
I found this topic very interesting. Race in the United States of America is one of the most controversial issues today.
People are often reluctant to share their opinions about race. There is fear of offending someone.
There needs to be more open discussions were these race relations issues can be solved.
Professor Richards stated this. Other countries such as India and Venezuela have major race issues. They just refrain from talking about it.
Venezuela and India have problems such as colorism and caste systems ingrained in the culture.
It's one of those topics that gets pushed to the side.
I do not think race and race relations are talked about too much.
I think you have a very interesting point. You said it depends on the sports stars in your area. That's what sports are most popular there.
I think this makes a lot of sense.
The change started to progress in my parents' generation. Most would call this the baby boomer generation.
I feel that this is the same for people that care about marrying outside your gender. That's a topic for a different discussion.
He went off to Ohio State. He has now had a black girlfriend for six months.
I agree with what you are saying!
I think that increased structure is something that would eventually happen over time It just took a lot longer in those regions. And happened earlier in Europe.
You make a good point. You say that race can never truly go away. It evolved in order to allow for human survival.
I think cultural and societal values will continue to change. As cultures begin to mix more and more.
I feel that over time, we will begin to see these become more uniform throughout the world due to interactions of different cultures and human populations.
I grew up in Panama. I finished high school in Florida.
For me it was very interesting being able to witness two different cultures. I especially liked speaking a different language.
At my boarding school in Florida, I was able to meet people from different places in the US. Likewise, I met people from around the world.
Living in the dorms you get the opportunity to meet a lot of people. From that opportunity I was able to realize how sometimes we judge cultures. Without even talking to a person.
But from getting to know this people. It made me see that we are not too different from each other. Also at the same time we stereotype and misjudge people.
On the other hand, living in different places gave me a different view on society/ life.
I think that being away from home/ growing up by myself I was able to see peoples different perspectives.
Do you and your girlfriend have any opposition from both your parents about the race difference?
Did you personally have any cultural barriers in your relationship that you had to overcome?
I am currently single. I am looking to travel a great amount after college.
I am curious to know some challenges that I might face. I want to know ways to conquer them.
It reminded me of a National Geographic article I read.
I was able to find it again. Want to have a look?
I agree with your response entirely. I think that America's troubled history is definitely the source of many of today's racial tensions.
The problem that then arises is how we could work to relieve these tensions and understand every communities' views.
I believe that the first step that we should take. Is to open a dialogue for every community to voice their concerns. Provide ideas for how to better their lives.
I firmly believe that the only way to connect communities is to allow them to have a productive way to voice their concerns in an attempt to fix them.
It is good to be able to talk to people who are not like you. It is good to talk to those who have differing views. It is a great way to open the eyes of some people. Some only see other communities as statistics. or blips in a history book.
I agree with you. It's easier for similar people to see the differences in people like them.
However, I think that when you point out the differences and especially bring several different people up ask them what the differences they see you see them easier as well.
I like how you mentioned about how many people lump all of Africa together. Their culture is more diverse than many places around the world.
Personally, I believe what we talked about in class is true.
Hockey is played in colder areas. Ice rinks are more accessible.
I wanted to add a possible reason as to why this racial divide exists.
I believe it lies in the upbringing of todays youth in the United States.
Many of todays NBA players including LeBron James are raised in poverty of the inner cities.
This creates a restraint on their possible ability to play ice hockey. It is due to the natural fixed costs associated with the sport.
Going back to what we talked about in class, I agree with the fact that professionals in the NBA and NHL are equally athletic and strong.
You have to start at a young age. It is very difficult to catch up with everyone else.
It is a fact that those living near the equator were the darkest. This is because of the amount of sun rays that hit that area of the earth. It seemed very clear to me. This is after Sam stated it.
I find it interesting. Someone may have dark skin. They might not have grown up in the area where the most sun rays hit.
I have the mindset that we are all the same. We are human beings who might look a little different. Sam asked Melanie to do this, it almost pulls you out of the mindset that we are all the same.
There were other black people who did not volunteer themselves like this. It is interesting. Some people might have the same skin color. Nevertheless, they are not the same at all.
The video I chose was Mixed Race Groups Are the Future.
I thought this was a interesting topic to discuss. There is controversy/ taboo associated with it.
We are observed to be different simply due to traits that we inherit due to geographical differences.
This is the trend we have been seeing. People migrate to other countries to live out their lives.
The generation in my family that grew up in America is marrying into families of other races.
This will evidently lead to babies that are going to be mixed.
The activity was done in this video. The activity was very intriguing.
There are new terms already stemming. Some of these are Indian or Asian American.
During this lecture, I was pondering the same idea.
I then put myself in their shoes. I asked myself if I would have felt uncomfortable in either situation.
There are beautiful people of all different races. Their uniqueness is a part of the reason they are so beautiful.
This is why I believe that I would not be upset in either situation.
I liked how Sam made a point. When he looks at a person's physical features, he sees his or her ancestors.
Similarly, I want to see people that way.
I agree with everything you had to say.
My brother is very Italian looking. He's gotten asked if he is Mexican.
He has been asked if one of his parents is black.
You say in your discussion that after this video and the class you started to see the world differently.
I am Chinese. We are always mixed up with Koreans and Japanese people.
Personally, there are some things that I look at that help me distinguish between the three.
It is hard to distinguish sometimes. I find it crazy that Sam can distinguish between a large handful of the races in the world.
I think that it is a really cool thing.
I personally feel that mixed-race would produce more cultural awareness rather than a loss of culture.
I really like the idea of mixing race,. We really can share a lot. We can learn a lot from each other.
As people start to grow older and graduate high school, they finally start to get out of their bubble that they most likely lived in. I think it's important to try and travel or try to meet new friends who have culturally different backgrounds.
A little kid who was eight years old in Ethiopia knew the amendments of the United States.
This kid lives in a completely different continent, in a country where they had only been in school three or four years. He knew way more about the constitution of the United States.
I wish more people were like that kid. He had a thirst to learn. He was open to learning about a different country and culture other than his own.
To conclude, I think it is important for people to go and see the world from their own perspective. Maybe people will receive a better understanding about each other.
I agree with what was said about why certain races play certain sports. It is a cultural reason not a biological/ racial one.
I feel like no certain race is more advanced to play a sport than any other race.
I think professional athletes are more advanced physically than regular people. They could play any sport that wanted at a high level.
I feel that what sport you play has a lot to do with where you are located geographically.
look at a sport like football. There is more of a balance to the amount of pros from each state.
I have played on sports teams my whole life with people of all different races, religions, cultures, and economic status.
I feel like none of that matters in sports and everyone works together to achieve a goal and be the best team possible.
The Cleveland Browns took a knee during the national anthem. You could see it was a mix of races protesting. It wasn't just of all one race kneeling.
I feel. I have an internal crisis. Sam says something thought provoking.
I felt this way that really stuck out to me was during the Evolution of Skin Pigmentation discussion.
Sam walked over to a girl. He asked her to volunteer. I was surprised to see that he picked my friend Melanie. I had a few classes with Melanie last semester.
He asked her to pick out the darkest skinned person in the class. Some audibly gasped.
I began to get so nervous for her. I wondered what she was going to say. I wondered even if she was going to do it.
A boy volunteered himself. Then the mood in the room lightened up significantly.
I began to think what I would have done in that situation. I was the one asked that question in front of 600 people.
Why does it make me uncomfortable to point out someone with the darkest color skin color in the room?
Sam often talks about white shame in class. I was never fully aware of it prior to this.
I never played hockey myself. A couple of my close friends have. Like you said, they were at tournaments every weekend. They constantly needed new equipment. which can cost thousands of dollars in the long run.
I hope to accomplish this through a study abroad program at Penn State.
There are no real differences between races. Everyone is equal.
I believe that the racial difference between sports is completely cultural.
They are better built. They are naturally going to be better runners than someone not of black descent.
We all have learned of slavery. It's detrimental effects on particular communities within America. The majority of us condemn racial discrimination.
It disappoints me that people were saying mean things about someone who was brave. That person was trying to make a thoughtful point. This allowed us all to learn and benefit from it.
Caucasian is the dominant race on campus. Everyone on campus tends to make friends with other students that are like them.
People do not like things that are different from us. It is just human nature.
Joshua, I totally agree with what you are saying.
Some of which are often linked to a certain race. African-Americans and socioeconomic status, for example.
I've come to a realization. Any productive discussion on race must also include a discussion about economic inequality.
Even though we learn as a child to not judge a book by its cover. Doesn't mean it stays in our brain forever.
One of the biggest problems is that people don't know how to talk about race. We take the easy way out. We don't discuss it.
That's the only way our nation can avoid repeating negative history.
It makes perfect sense. That people develop a dialect unique to their geographical area.
Anyone who plays sports professionally is a freak human being. They have crazy athletic abilities.
I agree with you. Understanding is a very vital part in communicating with anyone.
America is a melting pot of people. I wonder if those physical characteristics have gotten watered down. For lack of better words.
Everyone is guilty of passing judgment on a person from just looking at them for the first time. Everyone has biases.
It's rare for us to see. The taliban and terrorist groups in the Middle East harm the people over there as well. They probably harm them even more.
I have had a similar experience.
I like this class. It opens up our thoughts on controversial topics. It enables discussions about it in a safe environment.
People are using platforms, such as twitter and Facebook, as ways to send hate and harmful messages without ever having to face anyone face to face.
It was interesting to see what white supremacist rationale was. The rationale that supports their racist ideology.
No doubt I picked up small variations in my speech patterns. I pronunciate my words.
You would have to keep people from playing the game to make it racist. This isn't the case with basketball or any other sport.
What sport a child chooses to specialize in depends on their interest, skill, the popularity of the sport and in some cases economic ability to pay for said sport. This includes if it is offered at their school.
When hockey originally became popular, it was obvious that a lot of equipment would be needed. The only way you could play the sport was in the cold, considering it is on ice.
I think basketball takes a higher precedence in the inner cities. Due to the fact that you do not need much equipment to play the game of basketball.
Here in America, African Americans are incarcerated 5 times more often than whites.
There were Japanese Americans during WW2. They had no part in the attack on Pearl Harbor. They were mistreated anyway. They were stripped of their American citizenship. and put into concentration camps.
Understanding is a vital tool. It should be utilized more in the world today.
I believe that to glance around a room and ignore the color of skin, or the things that make us different, is an insensitive way to look at the world.
I hope that, with time, more of this sensible topics will turn into something that society doesn't feel uncomfortable with.
Looking at the races of indigenous people. It shows that the race of Eurpeans have a percentage from Africa.
Sticking with what you know is easier than sticking your neck out.
I started out this class in a bad mood. I was stressed out over something that had happened earlier.
Race conversations come up. People do not even realize it.
I also agree. You said that. Sports have a lot to do with it. One is located there geographically.
The school did not change his living situation. The two boys are now best friends.
It would be unfair to say. It does not still exist.
I think. A lot of people do not realize. We are less than 1% different.
Hello Ashley. I also chose this video. Like you, I agree with what Sam says about race.
This is not a country I am proud of.
I also really enjoyed this discussion. It provides an opportunity for this class to discuss more things that we normally wouldn't, like maybe ears, or cheek bones, or eyebrows.
I agree with Sam. We should be able to talk about the differences in the way we look. It is just genetics.
I do think that racism is worth talking about. I believe that the way we discuss racism is not the most effective way.
This also spills into the real world. How different looking Latinos are treated here in the United States.
I was very surprised to learn about some of the student's background during the activity.
I believe. Many individuals are hesitant to do this. They are hesitant in the thought. They will offend others. or possibly use incorrect terms to describe their appearances or even ancestries.
We have a majority of white people. This majority is slowly decreasing. We see more races come every year.
I was thinking about your first point. People are more likely to gravitate towards sports with stars that are most similar to them. You are spot on.
We discussed this topic during class. I was very interested
I know. They have distinct features. They separate them. I do not know them that well.
I remember moving into my freshman year dorm at Gettysburg College. A kid down the hall from me had his grandparents come along with his mom and dad to see his dorm room.
We are so used to looking at people and acting like we know everything about them before we talk and get to know them.
Everybody gets so defensive and offended about attributes that they personally cannot control. It leads to a defensive lifestyle. It makes others extremely cautious in what they say around others.
In simpler terms, I am pasty all year around and others are not.
I thought your post was very insightful. I enjoyed reading about your personal experiences of dealing with racial differences.
The best reason for why this is true in most cases. Most black women would feel as though they are not truly accepted. Into the world of a white man.
I was talking about race. I was thinking of having intelligent conversations regarding the topic.
You grow up in this conservative area. It's easy to let yourself fall victim to the brainwashing we're taught. It's so important to do some research, through traveling the world, or just looking things up, in order to gain perspective. It is fine with me if after all the research you still want to believe America is the greatest country on earth. but I won't allow myself to see America as this perfect place.
I think the United States could be a bit more deliberative and careful. In the way we deal with race.
The idea that white people are the most evolved is the root cause for racism and white people privileges in the United States.
The United States has never addressed its horrific past. The systematic opression of marginalized people that continues.
I do not agree with what they did. I was raised differently.
By what standard do we define an ideal diverse society without a true standard?
We grow up in a society. It values sticking with what we know.
I personally think that in order to understand others better and ultimately end racism people need to discuss issues. People need to confront the problems.
Subsequently, like any average human would do, we negate our problems. This let them fester.
Things like reforming our laws to give our police forces to combat racial profiling. Establishing a more equal, fair education system to ensure that impoverished areas arent stuck in a perpetual cycle of subpar education, etc.
World War II was solely based on the exclusion and execution of jewish people.
I agree. You said that. We're uncomfortable. We point out things like dark skin. to other people.
America is one country that has a big problem with race.
Many US Government Official are aware of the Social Benefits of the compensation. Are afraid of its financial disadvantages. They have to give money from their pockets.
Russel Wilson, Tim Tebow, even Michael Jordan attempted to play multiple sports. It didn't work.
The United States needs to find a way to cut the tension. We should be able freely talk.
In the video the person speaking in the beginning brings up the point of how in India race is not as big of an issue.
He says that, as a result, people will find ways to place themselves above others in their own heads.
Equal in the sense that we're 99.9% genetically the same person. We're only differentiated by our physical appearances.
Having a big nose has been something. I've known I've had every since I could remember.
I haven't traveled much in my life. I hope to get the chance to.
It wasn't just white people. The Majority of dissent came from the Indian church my mothers family was a part of. They wanted her to be with an Indian man who shared her religion.
People of color are still marginalized in their daily lives.
I agree with everything. You have said above.
Sure, we can all follow our own practices. We can believe in what we want to believe in.
Some people try to explain the race gap in sports. They explain the physical differences within different races.
It amazes me. Educated Americans can base their beliefs on appearances.
I do not think that sports are inherently racist.
That is where I think racial intolerance stems from. In my opinion, the only way for people to see people with a different set of eyes is to sit down and actually have race discussions.
That's all we really get to see.
Many times people think badly of other races. They just dont know people from that given race.
Like he said, experiencing this other culture doesn't mean you just sit on the beach of a resort.
If I ever have a question about someone's culture, I ask. I feel like that's more polite than remaining ignorant.
Most black women do not ever seek romantic relationships with white men.
Throughout history, these faiths and beliefs have fueled entire civilizations. They have been cornerstones of all, if not most of them.
I do not understand why race is still such a controversial issue in our society today.
He was not that cautious with everything he was saying. Some people in the class took offense to what he said.
We all are 99.9% the same. Why do we choose to focus on the 0.01% that divides us?
I hope society can move past judging people just based on the way they look.
The fact that so many of the protesters were young white men. Who have grown up in an era wheera where diversity is celebrated and re diversity is celebrated and honored. Tells us we have a long way to go to be educated about race.
However, the discussion needs to center around how we solve the problem on our hands..
In this video Sam asks a couple students talk about race. He wanted them to explain what race most people are in each sport.
I grew up in Ecuador. And I have been able to witness race discrimination in various forms and ways.
Silencing the discussion of race will never help us solve any of our problems. It will only continue to silence a group of individuals. People who have been wrongfully oppressed for years.
I think. There are multiple answers.
He is promoting that we should be proud of ourselves. Our physical appearance. It is our story. I think this is the way everyone should think.
Trying to tell all the Asians apart was going to be challenging. They all look the same to me.
You can back this reasoning. Many times, you may see players who change sports and do pretty well in both. An example is Bo Jacksonor hall of fame tight end Tony Gonzalez.
Despite all of the negativity that can be put online, SOC 119 is engaging its students. Giving us the opportunity to positively express our thoughts, opinions, along with beliefs.
I missed class to talk to the shc associate dean about it. That was my experience as a Freshmen at Penn State.
My response to that is India has a far more homogenous population.
Social media has become one of the most powerful ways of communication. A great way to voice ones opionons.
I know that it's a lot easier said than done. I also feel like the issue will never truly be resolved.
The psychological needs of a human are all the same. People should show more empathy towards one and other in order to bring society together rather than farther apart.
Same thing for the Native Americans. They did not receive any sort of compensation for the genocide they have experienced.
The class exercise really opened my eyes. We are all equal. There is no such thing that white people are most evolved.
I love the fact. You want to help fix this issue. You're not willing. You are just a bystander.
It showed that you went beyond just the video/lecture and took the initiative to learn more about the subject.
It's always been something that we've been encouraged to learn about in school. It's never been an easy topic to discuss.
The baby boomer generation was taught to recognize the differences of skin color in a negative way.
It did not take much to notice that this man is deeply affected by what is going on in his country and culture.
I think traveling the world candramatically change our perspective of the world.
Listening to Sam, I now have different thoughts. I am looking at the topic with open senses.
I think you made a lot of good points in your discussion. Especially about news networks being biased.
It's because of history. There can never be an ideal world in which race is not a factor that we judge someone by.
It is absolutely undeniable. Police brutality has always existed.
That is in my opinion the most insane part of their ideology. They think they are able to accurately put specific numbers to certain groups to describe where they are in the evolutionary process.
We spent almost two weeks of class calling black people, brown people, etc.
I've never been to Italy. I've talked to my dad a lot about his experiences.
Most people like me make assumptions where people are from due to their accent. Sometimes I can't even figure it out.
People living in the warmer climates did not have this problem. They retained the wider noses.
I really enjoyed the activity we did in class. How we compared people's facial features and genetics.
If they would sit back and realize that just because something about them is different than how we live our lives.
Why do people divide each other?
So many hispanic people play soccer. Soccer makes up a huge part of the Spanish culture.
I find this to be true life.
The student named Arsh made the point that India has less issues of racism. Alhtough there wer more recent genocides based off race in India.
I believe there will never be a point in time where everyone is understanding of other countries practices. Individually, we have to be willing to accept the viewpoints of others. We will have to hope that will be enough to prevent feuds between groups.
Think about the hundreds of generations it took to get us where we are today. Our bodies including are skin color should be a symbol of pride.
America has changed a huge amount in race relations. Compared to 200 years ago. America has a very long way to go until it reaches complete equality.
If they looked like they had an Americanized look/style. Like wearing chill clothes were American. The more dressy and well presented were foreign.
That is an example of pointing out the differences between people.
I agree that we pay less attention to what race everyone is. I would be lying if I said there was no judgement or anything on different races.
In particular, I found the development of different accents to be comparable to the childhood game, whisper down the lane.
I barely speak about race. It is not viewed as politically correct. It is not proper to talk about.
The last time I checked. Basketball is a sport that mainly consists of dribbling and shooting a basketball.
I honestly do not know if we will ever see the end of racism. If we do not try and change the way in which we approach racism, will we ever come close to an end?
This way of thinking seems to be less supported by people.
I too never realized or questioned why there was a white man in the front of the evolution pack.
It's so crazy to learn that big noses are actually better than the smaller ones. Bigger noses do more for you.
The one quote that stood out to me from this short clip was something Sam said.
The atmosphere in class is so light and casual. It brings a refreshing aspect to the topics we discuss.
This is what I think. Skin color is something we talk about frequently in the United States.
I am shamed to admit that there probably have been times where I looked at pictures of poor countries. I thought to myself that the United States was superior.
It was very surprising to me. Our noses are used to adapt to our respective environment.
I dont think that those 4 options of , basically is evolution real or is Christ real, are not the only options.
The question isn't who's on the field but who's in the owners box.
I also really agreed with Sam's comment. Americans should travel the world to see what is out there.
It's all luck. I could have just as easily been born in a different country. I wasn't.
That being said, inner city kids are usually people of color. That is why they are good at sports such as soccer and basketball.
Every civilization dating back tens of thousands of years, have some sort of beliefs. I think there is a lot of power beind that history.
It is not a bad thing to have biases. We have to be able to recognize our biases. We have to ask ourselves why we think the way that we do.
There really isn't a reason to be uncomfortable. We do feel uncomfortable. We are afraid of offending people.
Black people be chilling.
I'm an extremely pale white female. I've always considered the pigment of my skin to be a curse.
I grew up in majority white community. I have never really been in a position where I was considered a minority.
I enjoyed reading this post.
I really like the social media option. I think in such a big class it's really beneficial.
I totally agree with you about assuming right away when you see an Asian.
What is even more crazy is the fact I was dumb. I was ignorant just to kind of say they all look pretty alike.
That leads to a big generalization. Not all people agree with it.
In Italy, generally the more south you go, the darker skin tone there is.
I would agree with this being a factor in the past. Nowadays, states like Florida have their own teams.
The racial idea that those of European descent were superior, allowed them to reconcile with destroying cultures. They beat, murdered, raped people, ripping families apart, and treating marginalized groups like animals.
It showed me how many people cannot tell the difference between Asians, Koreans and Chinese. This could apply to many other races.
It's just a matter of who decides to question and act upon the beliefs of other people.
In all of these instances the comments are slight. They all deal with race.
Until this day I had never thought about the idea. The picture was portraying the message of white people are most evolved.
Or, I wonder, would those gifted in the sport of football still play football?
A lot of white people fail to see it. Maybe they are choosing not to acknowledge their previlege.
What was even more interesting. ,.Was their reasoning for their decisions.
I do not think. Race is talked about much.
It's because of this. There might not be large racial groups that feel oppressed by another.
His frankness about how ignorant we are over the whole USA best country idea is very refreshing as well.
The world is a diverse place. There will be more peace in our society if people are aware about this.
But what comes to my mind is that with more and more people of mixed race, I feel that just by looking at a person's body appearance can not accurately determine their origin and race.
I grew up in a town with very little diversity. I was raised by parents that never spoke of race, let alone in a negative way.
Truthfully speaking it is hard for anyone. They say that. They have genuine reason behind their words.
But I do have a response for your thoughts about racial tensions getting better.
That's what Dr. Richards is saying right?
This is exactly what I talked about in my video response. Mine was based on the Chinese vs. Korean challenge.
When I first came to Penn State, a college with plenty of diversity, I made quite a few friends that were of a different race.
Talking about openly is very knowledgeable. I learned a lot of things. Day to day, people do not have those types of conversations.
Generally speaking, men (white males in particular), tend to be prideful. They're less willing to date a woman of color. That's why the most common combination we see today is a black male with a white female.
This issue was a very sensitive topic. This issue was a very critical topic this past year. It still remains a problem at large. The Korean people want to receive an apology from the Japanese government. of what Japanese soldiers did during Japanese occupation in Korea.
I feel that it is important to talk more about it. People need to understand what is going on in our country. They need to be educated on what is really happening.
Like Sam mentioned. It's important to get real exposure to these places. In order to fully experience a new location.
I agree with your last line. A black person choosing the fairest person is not an issue.
By doing this, I believe that we can discuss race in a way that will not cause problems. We can continue the movement to fix race problems in the United States.
I had some knowledge. Still, it was like I was completely guessing.
Most of our generation is mixed races. Our kids will mostly be mixed races.
For example, in the video, he explains that the longer noses are used for heating up the cold air we breathe in to our lungs during the winter time. Our noses change over time to adapt to our environment.
It's true for many people. A persons race and ethnicity is the very first aspect of information that is received.
Respectively, I am not sure I can say I agree with this point made.
I went to a public school. We were decent at lacrosse. The private schools in my area had really good lacrosse programs.
My boyfriend is half Colombian. Most people including myself do not realize it. Based off of physical appearances alone.
After this class, I started to think about why I've never seen this image with anyone other than a white male.
My dad's family moved to the United States. He was eleven.
During our first two weeks of class. Of the things that Sam had said. Stuck with me for longer than the duration of our lectures.
I see it. White girls try to compliment white girls.
I think this is a really interesting topic to discuss.
I feel like the choices that Sam gave last semesters class were way to broad.
I feel like race is a sensitive subject. We should address it. Put it in the past.
It is rude. You are ruining it.
We're supposed to just accept that racism occurred. We can't speak about it?
There is a recent white supremacy out speaking. In reality we are all equal , all the same.
This will not be a problem to the society if people can truly open their mind. People should appreciate the difference between people from every part of the world.
I would not automatically think to look at the nose or even someones eyes.
However, this activity specifically should how hard it can be to correctly distinguish a person ethnicity.
It was interesting to see what backgrounds these people were from. I said before I would not have guessed their backgrounds. I would have been wrong.
I have noticed this throughout my life. As a child, I have lived in the United States, Italy and Portugal. Have managed to always have at least one friend from the Philippines.
Perhaps on the larger scale we can pin race troubles on the lack of dealing with the genocide of the Native Americans. On the individual level that is not the first thing. It is not even a thought when I think of the problems of race.
I can relate to your point. Regarding having  issues trying to speak about race where you come from. I struggle with that.
While many people arent fortunate enough to go abroad and see what the world has to offer. It is definitely easy for people to learn about the world.
There's no need to bring race into these types of interactions. Doing so can take away from the interaction. It can create unnecessary tension.
Culturally, I think parents of different races support different sports. They base this on what is big in their home countries.
It's what I think. Humans in general have very high egos.
It wasnt until the invention of ships that people were able to travel across the world.
On the flip side, I do agree. People can be overly sensitive about race.
I still have yet to ask my new college friends about their ethnicity. Let alone their other characteristics. Such as their beliefs and values.
I have never truly traveled to anywhere. I have never been outside of America.
Colten said that he was intrigued and interested in what she had to say during class. You can physically not be attracted to a certain race sexually. That does not make you a racist.
It could just have easily been you that was born in less than stellar conditions.
I believe false preconceptions are a disease. They need to be killed at the root. They are the sole cause of race issues in America.
I bet you've heard that. It was said to a black girl once or twice.
It is not just Americans who cannot tell the difference. Asians had trouble telling them part.
There is a still a great deal of progress to be made. But I just hope one day the world will be at peace. Hopefully there will be equality all around.
My skin color is black. It helped me survive the heat in the Caribbean. It is nothing more.
The government that leads this country has traces of racism. It allows racism to be a continuous societal flaw, enabling it in certain situations.
The conversation has to change in order for us to accept our differences.
One example always comes to mind. It is teeth.
She was open to all races. She was not prejudice.
I find it interesting. You say that about the previous generations.
I've had my own stereotypes crushed. I've ended up hating cities I thought I'd love.
As a society, we should crave to understand race. It plays a big role in our lives.
Sam was saying something about it. All that we talk about in America is race.
We all have different backgrounds. Just because someone is mixed does not mean that these race issues eventually disappear.
It's honestly disappointing. Society has tried to manipulate people into believing that a white male is the most evolved species.
I believe culture, geographic location, including economic status all play a huge part in what sports people play.
I'm also mixed. I always felt like I had the best of both worlds.
We might want to uncover mysteries. Chances are there are other people wondering the same thing.
Today, it is more common to see an interracial couple walking down the street.
I watched a video called "Evolution of Skin Pigmentation". During a long time in American history, the average person believed the color of your skin defined who you were in every other way.
I have to admit, I felt just as uncomfortable as you that day during class when Sam made your friend Melanie pick out the darkest person in our lecture.
I remember race being discussed the most. When former President Obama was elected for his first presidential race.
Sam has mentioned that he has traveled to over 50 countries. He still feels like he doesn't understand the world.
If youve never been to the West Coast but judge your opinions based off pictures and movies. You will never truly understand. Unless you visit for yourself.
I believe. They would harder chance of succeeding at certain sports.
I believe that we talk about race enough.
To think that I have inherited my skin color based on my ancestors and where they came from. It has given me an entirely different perspective.
Kristine, I think it is interesting to hear your opinion about Sam. You even used your race in the lecture.
It makes sense. Some sports could be divided on the basis of economics alone.
I do agree with the largest component of this response. People should be judged by who they are individually. They should not be judged by their race.
I like this class. It opens my mind. Made me think about my ancestors. I never have before.
I completely agree. Some people are racist without realizing that they could come from the same ancestral genetics.
No matter what, race will always be talked about. It is a big issue today. It is especially so due to all the police brutality that has been going around.
I agree with your take on the subject. You made great observations.
Instead, we should be grateful. Someone cares to understand the issues of a country that isn't theirs.
I agree that religion seems the main factor in changing people's mindsets. They make us think we are more different than we actually are.
Meredith, this was probably the most interesting class so far in my opinion. I definitely agree with this comment.
That thing you drink out of is not called a water fountain, but a bubbler.
In the 1800s, the United States put up with the issue of slavery. It was very wrong, looking back at it.
We grow up hating confrontation. We hate losing arguments themselves.
I'd like to compare my childhood to yours.
If I had to pick out the darkest person, I would feel really uncomfortable. It's something that you shouldn't be uncomfortable with.
I don't actually think that. There is racism. It is more of a cultural thing.
This collective agreement can be heard in the response to Charlottesville. The President seemed to be one of the only Americans who had difficulty reconciling the situation. Condemning white nationalists.
I think from America's past people are sensitive to the topic. People are cautious when they talk about race.
You soon may find yourself in situations you would never previously imagine.
People are constantly talking about race. Deep, informed conversations are rarely taking place.
Race is a big deal in the United States. Racism runs rampant in the roots of our society.
Studying the image of evolution subconsciously. White people grew up with the idea. That they are the most evolved than any other race.
In this video Sam expresses. This class is one of a kind. It shows a realistic portrayal. We can talk about these topics.
If you look back on history. These differences have caused war, hatred, and seclusion. At the cost of human lives.
Study after study proves people of color are treated differently usually poorly because of their race.
It makes everything seem a lot less political. Instead, it gives off the impression that things just are the way they are.
They are definitely not always an even mix. There is nothing stopping someone from playing a sport they enjoy.
We would still have a decent amount of discussions on race. I never knew there were race problems in so many other countries either.
Our problem seems to be much more difficult to fix. We do not speak about race in the right ways too often, or even most of the time.
I had no idea there was a whole ideology and specific belief associated with them.
I believe biologically many of us go after and want to date what is similar to us.
One thing that stuck out was people staying in their own regions. People were not leaving.
Assuming they are descended from the slave trade. Their ancestors are from West Africa. Probably from hunter-gatherer tribes. Their primary food source was chasing down and killing large game animals.
Why does a native Asian look a lot like a native American?
I grew up in a football household. The culture I was raised in was very football oriented.
I wonder if thats ever really possible?
Your point about the weather was very interesting. I did not think of that before.
Personally, I think race does play a small roll in all athletes.
All humans have 99.9% of same genes. The idea that the white people are more evolved is a great example of White culture.
In this specific case, with that dude Hayden. I personally find to be pretty damn entertaining. There was something that was said. That didn't necessarily go over well with the majority of people.
Refusing to adress these issues only adds to the issue.
I think we are just afraid to address things because of the stigma surrounding race. Even if we are not trying to be incorrect or accidentally say something that we do not know about, people will instantly crucify you. They label you a racist. This does nothing to progress racial relationships in the country. only to shame others into silence.
The problem is not talking about race.
It sounds dumb to me thinking about it now. It makes so much sense though.
I agree with you that many of these athletes train their whole lives to get to their skill level. I think many of them are naturally gifted.
I do think we talk about race a lot. We should keep discussing it.
In this response, I am mainly talking about how I feel as a white female seeing other white people not dating outside their color-line. I know that a lot of people of every skin tone are pressured to not date outside their color line as well.
I have only ever thought about peoples backgrounds. Based on appearance in a very basic, stereotypical way.
As mentioned in class, there are arguments to both sides on whether we discuss race not enough or too much.
His super dark Italian grandfather discovered his grandsons future roommate was going to be black. He caused a huge commotion. He demanded the school to change his living situation.
I feel like being white, it almost feels offensive. I believe race is talked about it too much.
My favorite part of church (not like it had much competition) was asking my dad questions that I felt like were in the grey areas of the bible.
Sam takes this idea to the extreme. Sam talked about radicalizing the bible.
The fact is that all the possible questions cannot be answered by one book. People have to interpret the answers.
disagreement begins here everyone is going to read the bible differently.
The same is true when discussing the Quran in the Middle East. We as a society do not see it like that.
I feel like the United States made it seem like it was for different reasons when it actually wasn't.
I find it very upsetting how little
War is a terrible thing. People need to stop and think about the men, women, and children who live their life in it.
the fish is in it, it lives it's who life in it that it doesn't really feel it. this really opened my eyes. it is an amazing comparison true.
there are over 100 laws that is written
It makes me very sympathetic. I am proud to be American. Its not fair for innocent families to be traumatized.
I was in elementary school. My mother told me about the war outrage while President Bush was in office. She explained to me that soldiers who fought for our country died in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Hey Kazel! I had the same thoughts about Afghanistan. Sam asked that question.
That is the kind of person to consider a role model.
Mr. Razzo there is a man who now spites the US after the same situation.
Race is still very much an issue in society. I definitely agree. We do not talk about this enough.
This last question relates to what Sam was talking about in the video.
It's no surprise to anyone. The current U.S. government is implementing policy. It leans onto the right-winged, christian, conservative side.
For instance, he has been open about the fact that he does not support abortion. It goes against his Christian beliefs.
Although the verse does say this. It also says that a large amount of other people are not allowed into heaven either.
Instead even if one is religious, they should be educated from society to formulate their own opinions on topics such as same sex marriage.
That is showed that a slew of people not just homosexuals, were included in which list in the very same sentence who that all the people mentioned would not get into heaven.
The teachers are taking messages from the Quran. They are interpreting them in a way that is harming these children.
Is it fair to say that the majority of conflicts are based on religious differences?
It seems as if humans chose to deny the fact that other religions exist.
I find it difficult to rationalize that religion often drives wars. Wars are expressions of hate.
have never experienced war
I think it is simply a matter of where the location puts emphasis.
So, there cannot be much room So, there cannot be much room for some advanced some advanced
It means more people are enthused about football. Therefore, more high schoolers go out for football.
A program starts to blossom. The program brings in more talented players.
I really think that the media in the U.S. dehumanized Afghans. The media made their lives worth less than our own.
Although I have been aware of radical or extreme religious groups in both religions. The Christian groups were never on my radar much. Whether that be from the media or my family, or American culture.
has Talking about these ideas been
Therefore, I think open discussion is so important in helping us become more engaged with the world around us.
people can learn more about other cultures and countries in an unbiased way more people might choose to help people in these places they can stay informed
I had never known what the word sharia meant until this class.
It is hard to do. Most peoples' values stem back to their religion.
I understand that their religion and beliefs shape their feelings towards our government. Trying to enforce those ideals on us is wrong.
Forcing government laws in countries like Iraq has taught us anything. It just shouldn't be done.
We cant expect all the worlds problems. it is to be found in a book that cant possibly address modern issues.
I've very vaguely heard the term Sharia Law before. I never knew what it was.
This class, in particular, really opened my eyes. Islam and Christianity really aren't that different. There are extreme sides to both.
I've had many bibles throughout my life. I've never gotten past the book of Genesis. The Old Testament bored me.
I'm not going to go into it. I feel like today the separation of church and state is nonexistent
I believe its religion. The Bible is against homosexuals. It contradicts itself. Saying, "Love thy neighbor as thyself."
That's a way I never thought about it.
Another part stood out to me. Sam compared ISIS to the Christian Sharia law.
Its crazy to think Sharia is an idea. Many people follow it. What if it gets out of hand like ISIS.
Sam talked about. How he gave a speech. That gained popularity. In the middle east.
Basim reached out to Sam. Sam was spot on in what he said during his talk.
We had a chance to talk to basic. Some of the things he said were very touching.
Basims's last message was what last spoken to me in class
Others claim that Islamic terrorists could try to set up Sharia Law in the US.
Many different groups can interpret the Bible and Quran differently.
The Bible forbids many common things. The Bible condemns them equally.
People should open their eyes with religion.
I don't necessarily agree that war in general is for economic gain. The war in Iraq was heavily economically influenced.
"When" Sam was talking about sodomites in that same
We try to ignore a lot that we see in order
Even for individuals who follow a religion different than Christianity, it can be frustrating having to follow rules that simply don't
Unfortunately, for many of us the media is the only exposure we get to Islam. We often forget that the media is owned by individuals. Individuals who own media ave a vested interest in our opinion of people they might want to manipulate.
Many groups all around use religion as an excuse to do terrible things.
When comes to American government, you have keep church and state separate.
Considering most of the nation is primarily
You still have to keep it separate from government.
When we really look into the topic
I personally don't think race plays any role
People in this country are just trying to enjoy their lives with their families. This disrupted so much.
It is so sad that this is normal for these young girls.
LTC Garey explains that they are people just like us in the video.
The class where we talked
This class discussion helped to really humanize the Afghan people. It showed everyone, in many ways, they are just like us. There is no reason to hate them.
It's all about history. Looking forward is the way to change.
I have never dated someone outside my race.
There are many reasons I could think of. They may help explain why this phenomenon occurs.
We view the Willard Preacher as some crazy man. The Willard Preacher preaches how we're all going to hell.
Laws can discreetly promote Christianity. Laws may push certain points like how being gay is immoral. Christian lawmakers ignore teaching that Jesus loves all people.
There is a risk that laws may be based of a single religion I believe this country can not become violent. This country talks about forcing a certain view point on to others.
Sam brought in Lt. Garey for class. I was very intrigued. It quickly became my favorite class of this semester thus far.
Lt. Garey also gave us a look into why is easier for soldiers sympathize with fellow soldiers instead of civilians like us back at home.
I found myself guilty of these false judgements. I think the main component to all of this is the fact that we choose to not educate ourselves better. We continue to stay at a state of ignorance.
Its important to stay empathetic to the entire world. We would hope that such tragedies would never happen to anyone.
For instance, my uncles two sons have both been on tour in both Iraq and Afghanistan.
War is a horrible thing
The war is a disaster. The media over the world has lead the public around the world to feel fear of them.
I think this is something that we can learn from.
the fact that his perception was changed from a negative to a positive through some shared experiences is a good
There were no nuclear weapons, automatic weapons, cell phones or electronics back when these texts were written. Anything to do with modern problems won't be solved by an any religious literature.
I do not know many people who have actually read the religious texts of the religion that they practice.
They think with the mentality oF
For me, Building a relationship With a god  And it takes time It is ultimately a personal journey
I almost raised my hand in class as one of the only people going to Heaven. I realized I misinterpreted the texts.
Not reading your religious texts or only listening
I was someone who used to be a regular church attendant. The whole story of the bible is not being told in church.
In my belief, the church should not be scorning any group of people. People have sinned. One message that is a central theme of the bible is to love your neighbor.
I guess one could callit a defense mechanism. Most of the time, I use it as a tool to connect with the people. Those who I am addressing.
Basically, something you can't laugh at is scary. Something you can't laugh at has a solemnity about it. Something that is scary weighs down your mind.
It was a humanizing moment. I felt connected to my classmates. Sam sent super personal questions into the space of the room.
that is the reason I as an adult have strayed away from church and my old believes
Being associated with that kind of image is nothing I want for myself, even in the slightest.
The example of the texting and forms of communication was a great great example on relating it something we can sort of connect to as millennials.
talked about how we choose
We are pushing these things out of our minds. The system was not able to be adjusted.
It adjusts our mindset of what it means to be religious.
oo often we just imagine Afghanistan
I will be enlisting in the Army. I graduate.
I enjoyed this lecture. I realized that war is a real thing.
It wasn't until this class that it too opened up my eyes to realize this thing is real.
Or coming home one day and see your family home in nothing but rubble.
The media is part of the problem. The media hides the truth behind wars.
I disagree and agree to the use of Quran as the law of a country.
I disagree. It is sometimes.
You look at countries which enforces strict Sharia Law. The number of rape cases are in single digits. Almost close to 2 or 3.
Such good laws are in place. There are also bad to these laws.
These laws were made centuries back. These laws are not applicable to scenarios in the 21st century.
Restricting the use of entertainment seems like a vague idea to me.
I think what Professor Richards wanted
There is no one interpretation for every circumstance in our lives. Extremist groups try to promote their own selfish agenda. Extremist groupes use their bizarre interpretations of sacred text as justification for doing so.
I love this soc119 class. Professor Richards is doing just what I said.
It was extremely interesting to hear. A military man has spent tours in Afghanistan.
I never look at my family or my two year old little brothers. They are still so innocent and full of joy. They think there are kids. This pure and sweet that are stuck in this conflict.
I didn't even realize the biases I had created in my mind.
I need to be more thoughtful.
I don't blame anyone but myself. I often imagine why these are the only images we tend to see on cable news.
I thought that the entire country was a war zone. Which was completely not true.
Sam opened doors for the class. They see the Middle East.
People need to be more open to cultures. People truly do not know everything about other cultures.
He thinks that his family stops doing this work who  will do it?
It means living with the constant threat of getting killed.
And there is nothing more important than standing for what you believe in.
people get to lead a normal life because of men like him
We are quick to collectively judge. We judge groups of people as a whole. I believe this is our biggest problem in this country.
Maybe this is just because I am in the majority of this country. I believe in God. I believe in the bible. It does not even hit me when God is mentioned.
I find it interesting how Sam sort of, to me, displayed Muslims as the stereotypical terrorist-looking people that spread fear and hate.
It always seemed like this was a class
What scares me. This lecture seemed to have the goal to put fear in us. This is what could be coming to America in Christian form.
I do not see real Christians using violence and terroristic tactics to make that happen.
Maybe it was just me
social media outlets should provide authenticity. The generalizations are based on someones religious beliefs.
I also went through the same realization
Some of these actions may be harmful to other people. Some of these actions may be considered deviance behavior.
The ideas of the protesters may be correct under certain explanations of the bible. What these people are wishing for are something extreme and unfortunate.
It may be possible that their interpretation of the bible is true. They may be misleading, avoiding certain contents in the bible to achieve their goals.
Each religion has its own Bible. People may have different opinions on what their god is trying to tell them.
The actions that people do are kind and obeying the laws I do not think that there is any difference between them.
The other day in class, after learning Basims story, I went home and thought about it the rest of the day.
When the rest of the excerpt was shown, even I, as a Christian was not fully aware of all the other reasons one can be excluded from heaven.
most religions promote peace
I think American as a whole do not sympathize for any country that we have occupied in the past 20 years.
I can't imagine what it is like being Rafi.
Due to this, I feel like it is easy to make assumptions about another culture. One may not know.
The negatively charged way people talk about Sharia law Makes people not fully understand the full concept of religion
They are all a set of stories that give rules on ways to live your life.
How can one base every life decision on the laws of a book written years and years ago?
I've never read the Bible or Quran. I'm certain it teaches good positive ways of living.
Islam is not the only theory that gets described differently than what it actually is.
It is important to do our own research. We judge things that are talked about in the media. What they say could be one-sided. It could be not well researched.
Realizing so many lives are being taken as a way of resolving a political or non political issue is heartbreaking.
Every person has their own life and their own
If we keep fighting against one another we will never come together as one world. We will never embrace our humanity.
I think there is some validity to your point though.
When I learned what we went to war in the middle east, bombing civilians, I was in disbelief.
They dress the same
The news shows us the full story. We can better understand the situations there. Maybe we could treat other Muslims fleeing from their war torn country with more respect.
I have lived my life in the belief Jesus is lord. He is the son of God who created everything in existence.
To me, that never made sense. I learned it wasn't the faith that was wrong. The way the people who were behind religions were corrupting the people.
They were able to control and corrupt people by assuring them
They concern themselves with hours long prayers. They always ask for donation from followers.
I don't just limit myself to the teachings of the holy Bible.
I have come across one difference. Not a whole lot of people have payed attention.
I am perplexed at the fact
I think that religion is a very interesting topic. Religion can be interpreted in numerous ways!
I found it sad and unfortunate that the civilians are the ones who get the most harm.
I automatically think of war.
The war there has been going on my whole life.
I never really thought about how its
It is rare to hear the opinion of an actual citizen.
I agree that many Americans have a bad stereotype. It is one of aggression against Afghan people
The way he taught the class and was able to grab our attention by using comedic comparisons. Helping us relate it to aspects of life that we as college students face on a weekly basis.
Almost every individual who reads a book
They act out in certain ways. That is what they believe true.
A large variety of religions exist throughout the world.
Through all the traveling that Sam has done, he has been able to experience and feel for these people.
In the story he explains. He was called into a meeting with Afghani allies. The Afghani allies claim to have captured the commander.
Was he granted some sort of immunity?
I was wondering if LTC Garys tone and behavior toward the commander changed. He found out his true identity.
He would often change the subject. Sam discussed it.
This lecture opened my mind. Christianity and Islam are closely related.
I think religion is one of those things
it can be interpreted over time like a constitution
Just like quartering slaves sounds ridiculous to us now. I do hope that there is a day. where being a homosexual is sinning can be seen. past our time.
Whether you agree with everyones interpretations does not matter. Having a dialogue to help understand is key.
It seems like a ludicrous statement given the decade of media Americans have been exposed to regarding the country.
However, thats obviously not an accurate depiction. That's not what life is really like for Afghanis.
The reason behind why we have an Establishment Clause makes total sense. It is consistent with the idea of the separation of church and state.
How come it never seems to be enforced?
I consider myself a spiritual person. I believe in some sort of higher power. I don't affiliate with any religion.
Sometimes there are terrible things going on. Almost no one hears about the terrible things.
I have my own beliefs as an individual. My core values and beliefs fall in line with those of the bible.
This is actually something
I agree with your statement. People consider their interpretation the correct view of religion.
To an extremist, they must feel as though their extreme or violent actions are the only way to achieve salvation or follow the true teachings of their faith.
In the fight against radical extremists, I think we should be doing more to understand the mentality of these people
They put their lives on the line to fight for our country it is something brave it takes a certain kind of person to do
These are real people. They are trying to live real lives.
If this was happening in our country, it would become so much more real.
It is easy to disassociate from the wars in foreign places. We do not know how much this war is effecting real people.
In class, a face was put to the disasters and the war problems. It made the war seem so much more real.
The video clip that I have selected to respond
It is different to hear Sam say Christian Sharia. That is not a term I have heard before.
Whenever I have heard the term Sharia I have heard it with a very negative connotation.
I found it very eye opening. Sam talked about a Christian Sharia. Usually Sharia is only thought about with the Muslin religion.
That is not to say I am ignorant. Faults and shortcomings of many perceived ideologies of the catholic faith.
The bible is the written word of God our creator. I find comfort in trusting to guide me through my life.
One of my favorite lessons in religion
Original Sentence To have your whole life uprooted in the blink of an eye
My grandmother is also from Ireland. I understand how different the relationship between church and state can be in other countries.
There was a Jewish community that attended my middle school. I would've found it odd if they had been controlled by a christian ruled government.
It creates an impression on the American people. Violent acts are only committed by Muslims, which isn't true.
I never realized that how horrendous war actually
In regards to Colonel coming
He asks them their opinion on why things are the way that they are. The black students never seem to have a good enough reason.
This made me think about the world. I've been brought up in the world.
This allows someone to be trapped in a bad relationship. They are unhappy. It does not seem fair.
The only thing is that it is war torn.
The news we see every day always leaves out key information.
I feel unaware of what is happening in the world. I only watch the news on tv.
the perceptions people have on military men and women.
personally found this video interesting because
he says that this perception isnt true that I tend to think otherwise.
not always in the video he mentioned how new soldiers
what you said
I do not believe in the same God that the hateful people we see in the media believe in.
more people need to recognize the similarities between religions.
I am very confident in my religious beliefs. I do believe that my God watches over everyone. I would never place more value on my values over another person's.
I began questioning hypocrsiies. I questioned translations that exist within the bible.
I believed parts of it. I felt that a lot of the ideologies contradicted themselves.
I was bored by all of the metaphorical messages I received I was irritated by all of the metaphorical messages I received
I was turned off by the myopia displayed by many christians. It comes to commonly disputed issues.
you should have no false gods, (that means no nNetflix binge watching.
The bible also says to love everyone.
Dehumanizing someone by removing or ridiculing their right to be in a relationship look like love?
Using that reasoning, you need to follow it with everything you do.
a huge forgotten point is the establishment clause
I believe in a higher force. I can't say that I live by the Bible.
I admire those who have so much faith in this book though.
However as he continues
There are people that take good from these teachings. There are people that take drastically different ideas from them.
Religions are all really similar for the most part. That is something should be noticed. Religions are a guiding way of life for people.
I loved his comparisons between the Bible and the Quran. It showed me that there were a lot more similarities than differences.
I have always interpreted the bible as the good news. It was so eye-opening to me. To think that white supremacists and other hate groups justify their actions with Christianity.
select group that lives their lives with hate for others.
I was very surprised. We were able to Skype with him in class.
I couldn't believe that Professor Richards gave us the opportunity. We got to really hear his pain and suffering.
Essentially sharia law is a group
The experience of having a real life
They are normal people. They are living a normal life along with a family.
He lost everything he had.
It is so cruel . These are certain things that we can't do much about. It's sad.
I really enjoyed hearing about this in class. It offered a perspective differing from the stereotypes associated with Afghanistan.
All things considered, I think it is important for people to truly understand Afghan culture. If they dont, the stereotypes of it being a war-ridden country will still exist.
It is weird to think that each of us has benefits. The benefits are fitted just to us.
No human being can actually truly represent their faith from its true meaning. Every single human interprets their religion differently.
However, the way they are reading is different.
The extremists interpret what they read. It is the holy word of God.
They cite one out-of-context verse. They base their actions on that specific verse.
The student points this out in the beginning. Everyone finds a way to argue that they are the better person.
Everyone wants to have great success
It does not make it easier for any person involved.
there is definitely double standard as Americans, we often don't notice
Those pictures and video clips shown on the media are sometimes misleading
I remember thinking to myself why are we still over there. Why can we not drop a bomb where all of the militants are. Be done with the war.
However, they get caught in the crossfire.
They to go shopping
There is no defined enemy
That is where I think that is wrong.
This country is so competitive in every aspect of life. That people now feel like they can not have their own piece of mind.
living in a community full of terrorism and war is a complete different story
It's actually quite interesting. All these different religions throughout the world have very similar beliefs.
They are taught otherwise.
hate is something that is taught it is not what we are born with
With that it is completely clear that we are using recent events
never meant to interpret the Bible
It was very smart because it was hard to argue against anything Sam said. If you do, you'll automatically be considered reacist. There is not much you can argue against what was said.
A common complaint I have heard from people. Is that if a muslim does something to cause terror it is terrorism. When a white person does the same, it will be reported as someone having mental issues or being a good person overall.
Islam has gained a bad name. Some radical groups carry out terrorist attacks. They carry them out in the name of Islam.
Another thing that Sam talked about during this class period was the idea of religious freedom bills.
Afghani law punishes discrimination against others for all the reasons
He starts touching upon family life. He touches on the way he has to say bye to his family everyday. He might not return. My heart shattered.
a family (having children) due to the current circumstances.
I have to agree with that. I am a Catholic. I read the Bible.
Yes, I am Catholic. That does not mean that I agree with Bible when it comes to same sex marriage.
I too believe. There is a higher power. I will never understand it until death.
Which is why I think religion is such an easy way. it thought to comprehend people.
At some point in the lecture after talking
Original Sentence It was only in their interest to completely ruin Venezuela
I understand where this man is coming from. They bombed his home using political reasons. They attempted to instill a coup in my own country.
I do not feel any disgust towards this country. I live in this country now.
I believe this lecture definitely opened people's eyes to something they have probably not even have heard of at all.
It wouldn't be in their interest to show all
Would they have been as cruel as the original settlers? They stole, tortured, and enslaved.
This is because racism is something that we are taught. It is force fed to us at very young age.
I completely agree with most everything that you said.
No one should have to face limitations for the lives they live because someone else cant accept other peoples beliefs.
It's crazy how people interpret the bible differently It's crazy how people interpret the bible radically.
I really enjoy where you said
In fact, they are some of the most peaceful people I know.
While he is correct in this point, the elephant in the room is the fact that the
The Quran and Sharia law, interpreted by different people of its faith, terrifies me
the most Muslims do not follow this absurd version of Sharia. Sharia remains an evil. inhuman form of law. order around the world.
Even if your religious book here has a description of divorce, in our country you also have to go through legal divorce.
The four ways women can go about getting a divorce is interesting.
she is allowed to divorce him.
I chose to write my discussion. I wrote on what the Quron says about divorce.
It is similar to child support in America. The man must support the woman after the divorce unless she agrees to not receive money from him.
There is a similarity to America. The divorce cannot happen unless the woman agrees.
It is extremely sad that radical Islamic believers bring so much negative attention to such a peaceful religion.
I am sad that I am not being taught about other cultures and religions until now in my college career. It truly is a conversation worth having.
In this segment, professor Richards compares the Bible to the Quran on how they play a role in dictating the way society functions.
I have never been formally introduced
Many people assume that a large amount of Muslim societies base their laws and norms around the teaching in the Quran. That is not the case.
It is important to note that the both Bible and Quran contain regulation
There are small societies or groups of people that live their lives according to the guidelines. Almost every government has its own laws.
Being a Christian myself, it was very interesting
I agree 100% with your saying about proactive conversation
The way that I look at the New Testament is that it should be open for interpretation.
No one was there when it was written. It's impossible for anyone to know what the author's intentions were.
I started having sex when I was a junior in high school.
All these activities of us are going to keep us from heaven why do we pick and choose which are acceptable?
This is where a lot of my doubt in religion comes from.
Since being in college, I have identified as agnostic.
Some of the beliefs did not make sense to me.
that homosexuality is innate.
You reference the Native Americans and the smallpox epidemic. You feel it limited the diversity of America, as a whole.
I completely agree and support
Majority of the people use these books a guideline of life. it is very true that misinterpretation comes i several levels. you can understand it by relating your real life experiences with it.
I took an African American studies course. I learned a lot about these historically racist laws that Sam brought to our attention. I was incredibly shocked.
Most if not all of the racial inequalities in America are because of systemic racism. Alot of people are not given the same opportunities because of the implications of these racially-motivated laws.
we will not be able to make America a better place
I agree with everything you said.
I love soc 119. I feel as if sam has to dumb down the material to make people comprhend basic things. I've noticed to many of us that are international, from different countries and cultures. Is common sense.
Honestly its a crazy concept for most people a lot of the stuff sam talks about. The average person knows so little about the world.

We experience racism on a daily basis. It makes it an easy discussion topic.

War affects real people had to be that  one of the most interesting lectures we covered that far.

I saw photos of their everyday life. It did change my initial view of the country.
On a different note, I was glad. Sam briefly talked about how war. it was not just about physical fighting.
Who stated that soldiers Which usually send most of their time That negotiating engaging with other soldiers.
It upset me that Bassim lost everything and the United States Government didn't even care.
I was very upset that the United States Government barely even gave him enough money to pay for the funerals of the people that he lost.
It makes me upset that we never discuss these things.
It also made me think about how privileged I am to have a home and my family still with me.
It was eye opening to hear him say that he viewed

Its hard to imagine a world that has laws actually governed by religion. I watched a show on HBO called The Handmaids Tale. The show gives a glimpse into an America run by radicalisms.
I haven't read the Bible completely. There have definitely been some passages in the Bible where I question what it's saying.
Alyssa I agree with you. Alyssa sausys we live in a society. The country Afghanistan is generalized as a country of violence.

Knowing Raffi put his life on the line to do the work he does is scary.
They are ignoring the fact that their Bible that   says that is wrong to hurt another person.
mixed up with law
However, I believe religious law gets a bad reputation.
I would argue that if those lawmakers lived in today's modern era. The laws that have been written would be different.
I believe that the religous books are given by God as a template for how society should work.
Society progresses and so does beliefs change of the human kind.
Because of this, Islam has gotten this image of being an aggressive, hateful, and violent religion.
It's a terrible truth of life that there are some people
That is innocent people that are being killed because of the war and just
We are so privileged to live somewhere where we are not afraid of being bombed or attacked while we are in our homes.
I am grateful that Rafi could join our class and share his perspective. It opened my eyes and informed me so much on the lives of people in those kinds of places.
Personally I think Basim is such a strong person for going through
goodnight to the people
how it is difficult
ways I understand
I appreciate your post. I do have some things to comment on.
the racial tensions have heightened in recent years. they have been there such years.
The KKK is a hateful group that has a history of severe racial violence against black Americans.
Though I am 100% in agreement that there are still instances
The tensions in Ferguson, Missouri. Are more of a reflection of the discriminations of the past. Than anything that happened to MIchael Brown.
I am also yet to hear any leaders who helped stir the pot in Missouri acknowledge the falsehoods behind that particular situation.
Being schools designed for thought. They do not establish the laws of the land. In the minds of the next generation.
What we need as a global society is free and publicaccess to proven factual information. Without the endless distraction of advertising and corporate interests.
I feel like in the US, we tend to believe that our society
we keep sliding into this into these so-called religious freedom debates
I was raised Jewish. Basically slept my way through Hebrew school. I don't really associate myself with any religion.
In class I learned that there are similar parallels between the bible and the Quran.
Not to be offensive, but I don't believe in any religions and I don't think that a book should be able to justify someone's actions or tell someone how to live their life.
No one should be looking at a piece of text. it is base their life off of it.
People find comfort in their religions. They value some of the same things, too. They believe in Heaven and Hell, Satan, and similar commandments. Commandments are a set of rules given by God for people to obey.
Religion is a choice and if people chose
This was the first time

But if everyone can just cherry pick or create their own interpretation

Yet many of our leaders who call themselves Christians. Are no different than most Americans who have also gone against the teachings of the Bible.
It is incredibly hypocritical when a politician argues. The policy change on the basis of religion. Politician has more than likely done something. Politicians would go against what the Bible says.
It was truly impossible for me to figure out what makes a personNative American, Chinese, and most of all Asian European.
This all makes sense to me. I guess I just never knew how similar these people could look.
This shows me that these words actually have very little accuracy
There are issues with both of these things. One allows us to forget that racial disparities exist. The other could allow us to focus too much on them. Possibly dividing us even further.
the advancement of race relations.
I am glad that we got the chance in class to hear that Rafi talk about his life back in Afghanistan
Especially like Rafi, since his partner died doing peaceful work
They believe that every problem that occurs can be interpreted by the Holy books.
I found this class very interesting. I grew up my entire life attending Catholic school. Never really had an idea about other religions.
This was honestly my favorite lecture of the year
It questioned people on why their understanding of other peoples religion without truly understanding
In the beginning of class, I remember thinking the attack on Sharia Law was crazy. Sharia Law could never happen in the United States.
The Torah (although much more complex than just a simple book of stories that it looks from the outside) is basically a blueprint to understand how to live a good life.
Some people radicalize the ideas of the Quran, but people radicalize ideas from every religion!
the New Testament have to each other
If the Christians were to truly follow the bible and their beliefs, most of them would be going to hell.
rest of eternity
We have so many issues happening that a book cannot solve.
I loved your comments and agree that no one person has the power to say that their belief is right and yours is wrong.
I also found Sam's fish in the sea comparison very interesting.
People find motivation and purpose for life in many different ways. It might be difficult for people to relate.
you do not agree with another religion's customs. it is important do not display this disagreement with hatred violence. it make an effort to at try to look at it with a different view.
I come from a very generic
Coming to such a diverse environment such Penn State. this Soc 119 class has opened my eyes. many of the issues that minorities. other religious groups face.
I agree with this due to the fact that I am Catholic. I believe that the bible is old. Due to the advancements in society that it is interpreted differently.

I feel like people fight so much due to the fact that they

Here in the United States, we are so numb to what goes on in the rest of the world.
the hate that goes on in the world, that it is hard to relate to the innocent civilians being affected by the wars.
I can only hope that they are one day able to continue their lives without having to be fearful every time they leave the house. I hope that s here in the United States we learn to empathize more with the ones that have to live their lives in fear each day.
Like you said, I never picture all the civilians that are living in those areas or the tragedy they had to experience.
Afghan cities completely differently.
Not to mention learning about all the tragedies that were mentioned. they were to have happened where I live. I know I would devastated.
These innocent families who just want to live their lives peacefully, just like me, but cannot because of war.
the side that Colonel Garey was talking about during this presentation.
I think of war. The first thing that comes to my mind is fighting.
My older brother joined the military in 2008. It was during the war in Iraq. He was 19 years old.
they've encountered of fear
I have a photograph of my brother that was then during his time in Afghanistan with civilians.
I thought to myself wow, there is so much more to war than just fighting.
There is a part about war that is making sure the people that the people you're protecting, feel safe.
Colonel Garey struck a cord with me. Colonel Garey was speaking about the things that civilians really don't understand about the war.
I believe that they both provide good guidelines of morals that you may want to teach to your children. There isn't enough content to create concrete guidelines. For something as large as government.
I feel as though every religion share the same values.
Some Americans do not want more  that terrorist attacks.

At that time Ronald Reagan was the president. Under the Reagan Doctrine, he believed that he must fight the Soviet Unions red scare at all cost.
The Mujahedeen are the Taliban. They fought against the Soviet Union. Now, they turn the other direction and fight against the United States.
This is the first time
It sounds bad but it is the truth
everyone is a bad guy.
I do believe that the military should find more ways to learn about the culture of the Afghan people to better distinguish actual culture lifestyles of the citizens
I think it is definitely beneficial to address the attacks
I agree with what you are saying in this response.

other countries are portrayed badly.
Separation of church and state is a cornerstone which the US was built on.
Our founding fathers thought it to be much safer if the two remained separate and did not consolidate power.

This is a very interesting idea that I had not thought about previously.

sharia law does seem like a good thing
While these are all impressive and significant improvements
That's why I wasn't surprised when our guest began to talk
I just thought of them as foreigners that happened to live a different way of life than the average american. My opinions have changed fast over the past year.
He was very kind to me. We got along. We never really clicked. On to fall I went with similar opinions.
I definitely agree with you on the fact
I believe that the reason groups like the Westboro Baptist Church arise
they are doing the work that God has intended
Bible does it ever justify
The constant practice of justifying hate using the Bible and Quran needs to stop. It's detrimental to the target groups and immoral overall.
The way Sam was able to explain got me to understand how other people follow their own laws.

If the citizens of Afghanistan or Muslim followers are looked at in a negative way
Many extremist and radicalizers are very hypocritical. Which is another reason why nothing would ever be solved by looking in the Bible or Quran.
My journey from a practicing Catholic to essentially an Atheist. Was largely driven by the hypocrisy in the church. More specifically, in the interpretation of the bible.
I found this topic particularly compelling. It is due to my experience growing up.
In the recent years
I recognized that this was wrong and in my opinion, unlawful, I never saw the hypocrisy in it.
For instance, when Mike Pence signed The Religious
I would not have thought of nor put it on the same level as Islamic Sharia until after Sam's lecture

I thought LTC Gareys response was

I personally found this interesting
another misconception people have about war.
His point was that we often dont realize how much time soldiers spend doing other things.
LTC Garey said something specific
the United States government needs to understand where our enemies are coming from.
I think thats how so many hate
more people in power were willing to learn about other cultures, Id bet there would be a lot less conflict throughout the world.
I will never forget
I have never been someone who has supported war. His experiences just made me hate it even more.

I think Rahfi made me better understand his religion

It is important to not take one verse out of context. The next verse may justify a statement. The next verse may explain in detail its meaning.

I remember this class. This specific part caught my attention.
We as a country would have so much less hate and animosity toward Afghanistan if people took a step back. We should look at Afghanistan as a country with real people in it. We shouldn't judge them based off what is portrayed in the media.
something I found intriguing
Seeing his daughters on the projector and hearing how he risks his life
The fact that his partner was murdered for doing the same type of work that Rafi does really emphasized the risk Rafi puts himself in by speaking out against the problems in Afghanistan. It is something that would definitely scare me away if I were him.
erspective on Afghanistan was really cool.
hat you believe is right.
That's no different

Many people look at these two religions completely differently.. Many people would laugh at the thought that these two religions could be similar.

absolutely agree
This whole section
It was heartbreaking to hear about his tragic story
great value to him.
I was shocked. He forgave the United States. His religion tells him that he should.
Even news outlets rarely report on many of the bad things
Most Americans do not have an opinion on the war
Professor Richards mentioned
real families that have to live their lives
That could have been me in that mall if the United States were to be bombed.
more people even watched this eight minute video there view on the war would dramatically change.
It was shocking to me. This was one of the first of several pronouncements in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Reading government cannot start a church. They cannot pass laws that aid any religion. or promote one religion over another.
The politics of race within groups is seen. It is seen in national politics. The President is often calling on hate. He wants to achieve a certain agenda.
the bigotry used to elicit hate
make everything about it
iving too much attention to it
The one thing that gets
Everyone knows they are there. There is no way to define that it's wrong.
he colored person gets the job over the white person, it is to fill the quota.
f the colored person does not get the job,
There really is no winning
India is a little more progressive. India is not to the point that everyone is equal.
This man had nothing to do with the war. He has lived In America. He committed absolutely no crime. He had his entire life changed in a day.
it made me feel all sorts of emotions.
his house was bombed
only feet awaY
I could not believe
his war affecting anything other than their career.
I knew that civilian causalities existed
I just wish more Americans thought the way Bassim does.
there is a war.
When will people realize? Life is too short to have anything but love in their heart.
It is unbelievable to be exposed to a man. He lives his life through his religion.
It is people like Basim who inspire me to become a better person everyday
It is truly inspiring how
continues to keep moving forward
Basim is my idol. Whenever times get tough, I know not to make excuses. There are other people who have lost so much. There are other people who continue striving for greatness.
Some people find that it's
I personally can't speak

whatever point is being made.
She promised
follow the bible
parts are more important partsthan others.
We get this mindset
We need to of away with the misconceptions
there is any way to reach peace in the near future we should strive
positive aspects of society
he idea of a single overwhelming religious group
speaking in the short term
Many people, myself included, only see it from the perspective of a news outlet. We should be thankful for opportunities like the ones we have in class. We should get a deeper look at the devastation.
This closer perspective allows
Many people are overridden by religious motivation, financial gain, or political influencc. They could not be bothered to think of the consequences their acts of war bring to everyone but themselves.
definitely fun
I can agree. Sam would never want anyone to feel vulnerable to being attacked by certain beliefs people have in the class.
I am with you. There are more pros than cons. We are using social media in the class. We can interact with one another. to make the class feel more like a family.
He definitely did a good job of addressing
He never said
I loved how Sam opened
it doesn't affect our daily life,
we dont remember that there are millions of peopl
many Americans forget that real
children who want nothing more than to live peacefully have their homes destroyed, families ripped apart
happily with family
they are in a war zone.
Could you even imagine leaving
We never seem to put ourselves in other people's shoes
This is the life that they are used
One thing this class has taught
choosing involved in whats deemed heretic
Its interesting to me how society
I was younger
slack Christianity gets in this country is kind of wild.
the people trying to spread the word
a lot of people convert over to Christianity in their respective colonies
past the damage we
still going to die for other peoples
would not consider myself
I would be Christian.
I feel like God just wants everyone
the South are very Christian, some things continued to just not add up in my mind.
Im sure most of the people that live there are from there are kind
the South is also known for a lot of people still supporting Confederate ideals
Sam also talked about the Lords Resistance Army a little bit. I do not know much about. I had the little bit of information I found about it on the internet.
This groups used be
makes sense
I find it tough to live my whole entire life based on the Bible.
To me, it is all about personal interpretation. You choose to follow the Bible.
I believe it is meant to be seen in numerous ways. Life simply is not one sided. It is full of complexities.
He also talked
I was wondering one thing. I was wondering the extent to which it debated in the United States government.
there are people making religious arguments on the conservative side however
In some places in the middle east, the people do not really think about the country borders
Most of these countries consist of tribal groups, which have different interpretations of the Quran
The same thing has happened
I was kind of shocked.
hey are compensated by their husband is an amazing fact.
say they I mean women more
day societies its a little
wife be treated badly
countries like Afghanistan
differences in culture
living through it for the last decade.
The only difference is that Afghans live in a war zone
It is very true. Many religious people like to pick and choose what rules they follow in their religion.
can be seen in many of the examples you provided above.
discriminate against people who
this is also obvious with Muslims
on their religion.
The war in Afghanistan is interesting. There has never been a time in my life. I knew there was no war occurring in Afghanistan.
understand more easily
being able to understand Afghanistan
higher powers message
only certain people of that religion do.
ven agree with other peoples evil actions.
I am attracted to them
shoot my shot
I find only one difference with girls of the opposite race. You have to find different things to relate to them. They are from different cultures.
good experience either way.
The only challenge is this. You have to bring the girl back home. You have to see how your parents react to the situation.
Afghanistan by risking his life every single day.
The thing that drives me the most at the end of the day is my family
he said it was his responsibility to do this work.
you could probably say it is not Raffi's actual responsibility
I also don't have that responsibility of building and providing for a future family. I also, just as Raffi, feel the need to do it.
This people are willing to give a big portion of their lifes to help others.
we got to find a way to pay them.
I thought they all prayed 5 times a day that   chose to cover themselves.
Sam compared them to Christians, this completely changed my point of view
I am Christian.
When compared to Christians, I became more aware. Muslims are similar to me.
in hearing from Rafi Richard that I feel like I am getting a better idea of the realities taking place, which  only lends to more confusion.
just be incomprehensible.
I am baffled by other just essentially saying no to those causes
all of the things being achieved
I was happily surprised
I really think I will research
I strongly believe
Who is to say that a religion in specific should   be the basis to tell us how to live our lives?
I believe this shouldn't happen
I believe that your religion,
which I think is anotherreason
they really arent all that different.
I think this was a good point to bring up to the class
Sam brought up the topic of Christian Sharia. Religious freedom can make it hard for the LGBTQ community to get any rights.
should be allowed to have the freedom to deny marrying a couple
Gay marriage is legal in our country now
gay marriage to be allowed within my Church simply
In this country, there are many things that people do that I do not agree with. I respect the differences in everyones beliefs. We live in a great nation. It allows us to hold different ideals. and ideologies.
I thought it was very insightful to have a first hand experience from Rich
Afghan citizens.
It really highlighted to me. There is the huge impact the media must be having in the United States.
the media coverage of the situation in Afghanistan
affecting citizens lives
Its interesting that you highlight that the Afghani culture may be more social
I honestly think the world would be worse than it is now.
no real repercussions
take away everything we know today.
at the same time I feel like it would be less crime
they want to live.
I googled CSL got some prettY
going to a private christian college, basically keeping your children under a rock
I absolutely loved the way he explained this.
rest of the passage.
I'm always baffled by the hatred some of these Christians display. It doesn't say anywhere in the Bible to act like that.
My aunt decided to disown her daughter. She found out that she was marrying her longtime girlfriend. It was against her religion.
My aunt is divorced. My aunt had a child out of wedlock. My aunt considers herself a good Christian. My aunt disowned her daughter.
sinned more than her daughter.
not that different.
I never thought it about it that way
ISIS is literally pushing their idea of Islam on people
our experiences varies from his
their individual jobs
I have always thought that a book that was written 2000 years ago is not fit to decided law in the modern time.
video goes hand in hand with that.
business interest at hand
many modern-day aspects that are not even address in the Bible
he mentioned how all of the different groups of people all identify
Some might say that the white supremacists are not truly Christians
someone what religion
Christians following the
basis behind trying
speaking about Muslim
do not think that they are nearly the same
I thought this was interesting
I thought this was very important
it is often justified to kill a woman
This poll also made me wonder. Sam consciously avoided mentioning any statistics which did fit the perception that Sharia law in Afghanistan was similar to law in the United States.
During class, Sam Richards discussed how civilians
Often times, these different groups have difficulty understanding war from the perspective other groups.
n the lecture, Sam Richards went on to explain how civilians dont see how war affects military personnel, from being moved to a hostile, foreign place, to engaging in firefights
handled in a cordial matter.
hese differing viewpoints can at times cause disagreements
The second video Im going to discuss is the lecture
I am confused. You bring liberals into your viewpoint.
I think we see this problem
I agree. Many people in the U.S created these violent stereotypes. All people living in Afghanistan are dangerous, aggressive and a threat. It is because of the terrorist attacks on 9 11.
against the U.S
other Americans had the opportunity to speak
any country has invaded us
war ridden country
Our media doesn't show that family. They show such orthodox Muslims. They believe their way is the only way. That is not all Muslim people.
We can not judge a group of people
We use what the media
whole need to stop
ignorance leads to misunderstandings
an Afghan citizen speaking to us about their experiences.
In this video in particular
Personally, I really only thought of Afghanistan
I believe that this is the case
Whenever I heard anyone say anything about Afghanistan, it has all been war related. All I ever really associated that country with was war.
Sam put up
agree with you about how the public makes unjust generalizations specially about Afghani
I believe this characterization. This characterization is due to what is played constantly on the news cycles.
I just assumed for this country to be less safe.
Religion is not a topic
I do not devoutly practice one religion. I am aware of the fact that all people are different. People are bonded by the same practices.
the images of all the different hate groups in the nation that claim to be Christians.
religion are some of the last things that come to mind.
However, in their eyes they're following the words of the Bible.
idea sounded weird
more progressive
Especially our generation
These people are the ones that inspire the misconceptions  that we have about the multiple religions.
I am not an orthodox Christian. Nor am I highly religious. Just like you, I wasn't aware of the reasons one could be excluded from heaven.
This is because we probably don't read the bible on our free time. We don't immerse ourselves fully in our religion. We are easy to manipulate into believing stuff that we don't know about.
how they represented certain groups of people.
worse in my opinion.
In countries where one religion is practiced it seems
think it makes sense tat you hold onto the basic morals
There aren't instinctual
ts influences we wouldn't feel doubt towards it
he always tries to incorporate a lesson of empathy in his lectures.
Bringing Rafi Officer Garey
most Americans.
iolent things have been done under the name of religion
People really have misconceptions about how Afghanistan looks. Nobody has really been there during these times.
I also agree with your statement. Certain racist and sexist ideas presented in religious books are pass their time. They do not fit into modern society
The picture of the shop is also part of the video. It stuck out to me.
The increasing number innocent afghan civilians who killed  is mind blowing.
Its upsetting knowing that people who are dealt with living in Afghanistan have a higher chance of dying just. they could be caught in the crossfire of this war at any moment.
Even military personnel of the USA. it have been losing their lives over a war. it probably should have ended long ago.
I really liked what he said at first. The way we live our lives, a lot of times, we are like fish in water.
The only things I heard about Sharia Law before this class had a strong negative connotation.
Again, never having crossed paths with someone who abides by   that I havent had to understand it.
Another thing that stood out to me in the video was that Sam said the Qaran. the New Testament were similar from a sociological point of view.
Also, I live 5 minutes from New Jersey that  people over in New Jersey speak differently
It is interesting to see how our environments that we live can affect the way one speaks, their appearance, values, clothing choices, etc,
someone who talks to me that has an accent. I am able to tell where they are from.
From personal experience I realized how fake these people are that. i go to church every Sunday.
it is wrong to judge people. I started to make some observations.
I kinda think that it would just go back to how things are somehow. I kinda think some way history would correct itself to how it is currently.
I agree that citizens of America we need to educate ourselves on the world. we are living in be aware of what is going on around us  most importantly what we are doing to our world. the media does not show us the realities of America. which includes the mistakes we make and the destruction we bring to other countries.
I really like that the points  you made.
I think that is a big problem today. we are only fed a sliver of the information available to grasp these topics. we never talk about them.
It truly opened my eyes to Afghanistan. I thought I would never get to see.
It was much more uncivilized and more of a dessert war zone in my thought
That is the part I find to be really crazy.
their everyday life is different than my thought on it
I have never been off of the continent. I have been to a few countries. Their cultures are so diverse.
Who think many of People. who take this concept of reading hearing. who want into our everyday lives.
I just instantly thought of many people. it could definitely benefit from listening to this lecture.
I thought they needed to hear this the most.
They cannot let a book that was written so long ago, rule their lives in my opinion, especially not mine
it comes to other things. it comes to the topic of gay marriage or abortion. my parents have a lot to say about that
We can decide to let a book control our lives. We cannot be hypocritical.
nothing is more upsetting to me than those who preach their religion but do not follow it themselves
people go about religion this way. it makes me very confused.
I do not want to deny the idea of a God. That is why I just consider myself agnostic.
My grandmother my grandfather met each other in the church. my granddad was an asshole to everyone in the house apparently. my grandmother put up with a lot of shit. they both believed that they should never get a divorce.
Its weird to think about how much power it holds in people's lives sometimes.
They didn't know each other very well. It was a popular practice back then.
Afghanistan is portrayed in America as a very poor country it is portrayed as a country full of Muslim extremists.
They heard the same response . we get when we try to bring up the problems. got to see how frustrating it can be.
Don't judge someone based solely off of one action in their lifetime. It forces people to live life with constant fear of consequences.
I think of Afghanistan I just relate it to war I relate it to fighting I relate it to negativity
It did a lot of things for me it made me realize how lucky we are to be living in a mostly safe country it made me realize how nave I was being when thinking of Afghanistan in that sense it made me sad that all Rafi kept saying was how important peace and brotherhood is we need to have more of it in the world.
They started a proxy war with the Soviet Union. The CIA supported Afghan rebels against the Soviet Union. The Afghan rebels were called the Mujahedeen.
Today the Mujahedeen are known as the Taliban. They are fighting the United States. Originally they were at the the same side. Fighting against the Red scare of the Soviet Unions communism.
I think that interracial dating has been able to allow people to experience other cultures. It allows people to learn about other races. It allows people to break down stereotypes that surround some culture.
The reality of Sharia law is that it is based on a book that promotes peace,which  is actually quite similar to that of Christianity.
However, people interpret the story differently. This means people will live life different ways.
It is true that Quran is the guideline that  teaches people to live in this world.
However, it is impossible to fully understand it. it is so tiny. agreement and disagreement can definitely occur.
who can never fully say that who is the definite meaning that Quran It wants to understand.
I feel that in the end. we have to respect Sharia law. Quran was interpreted in that way. some people agree to live life like that.
how many meaning people understand from Quran, in the end. we have to respect the majority of peoples thought in quran.
I found it interesting. in this rant he said that there is a school of thought. people look to the Bible and quaran to answer questions. instead of fact, they are left with interpretations.
That's the same thing people do with the Torah, everyday.
A mulatto person (black white), no, it does not concern me that  people are marrying other races.
I was growing up, I never thought about the fact  that my parents were different races.
And I look at other interracial couples I don't think much of it
The video I chose is Christian Sharia in America. It discussed some things that I feel very strongly about.
I developed my relationship with God by praying, reading the Bible. i trying to live my life according to His teachings in the Bible.
I have my own beliefs, I am not one to judge those that do not agree with me.
Today, the bible is available in many different versions. The Bible accommodates the preferences of many people.
In my KJV of the Bible. these 2 verses sound EXTREMELY similar. it comes across in a way that I feel is less harsh..
It is unfortunate that we have not been able to get  completely over our past issues involving this topic.
To think that there will be a twenty percent difference in salary. it increase between the two races in dissapointing.
we are not directly affected by the issue. we often tend to generalize the issue. it look the other way.
Rafi has to go on with his daily life to live and support his family He is such a great example of those innocent individuals They are simply trying to live in the midst of the war
I can definitely agree with everything you just said I add on top of what you just said I believe that interaction with people from all different cultures is so essential to understanding the world
I was also raised Christian
My father, however, was not very religious that  today considers himself an atheist.
I am glad that we have religious freedom to allow us to uphold our beliefs. it enables us to keep our morals aligned with our faith.
The more people that become aware of what is going on the  more help we can give.
A life in which they dont have to worry about which  a bomb destroying  their house.
I really liked hearing about why her hair was the way it was.
that was the kind of hair of particular race and gene in my opinion
He said the hair protects peoples head from the sun. it doesnt burn their head.
A question I didnt think of at the time . there are fair skinned people in south Africa with straight hair.
I've honestly never really thought of it as a normal city with typical every day families. people who are just trying to live their lives peacefully.
They only ever talk about the tragic and horrible things. These are going on and portray the whole country as being one evil and violent nation.
Religions aren't umbrella terms under which everyone holds faith in the same way. the actions of radical individuals are no representation of other individuals. it share their same religion.
Take this example. Would you think their would be the same amount of racism and mistreatment throughout the different ethnic groups? people actually understand and comprehend more the other cultures.
I also agree with you. cultural ignorance creates a barrier throughout the different ethnic groups.
you have to use your own judgement in wrong and right at the end of the day
I feel that you interpret every part of the Bible literally  that it just doesn't really work well.
You mention the audience question to Bazzim. he is angry about what had happened.
I completely agree. what you wrote.
As a fellow Christian that is how I live my life. Some of the things written in the bible I do not agree with.
Its brings us to really appreciate the way that I  feel most of the people in our generation look at religion.
That's not why. this country was founded.
From the time that the US occupied Afghanistan, weve been bombarded with pictures of active combat zones . men in camouflage covered in dust in the middle of dry-looking land.
Its strange to think what a skewed vision we have of what  the word war really means.
I think that is what stuck with  me the most.
I used to think. War in Afghanistan.
we first deployed troops to the middle east to Obama's plan to get our troops back I have always tried to stay up to date with the United States issues around the world
This is selfish to say but unfortunately true. the Obama pulled our troops from the Middle East. I losing interest in the war.
I have never experienced any type of comparison to war.
The picture of the traffic jam. Sam talking about the emotions . they experience are just the same ours.
In this post Ill be reacting to the Radicalizing The Bible video from SOC 119
a terrorist attack occurs they almost always mention that the person was Muslim . that sticks to the viewers mind.
My response this week is about the recent exercise we did in class  where we had white people, black people switch roles.
who to find out that his duties who consisted mostly of drinking tea with the enemy  who was quite shocking
In particular, I liked your statement of how soldiers are people at the end of the day. Instead of these killing machine robots that society tends to categorize as.
I never really thought about the perspective of the people. they have to live through war every single day of their lives.
Another interesting thing you brought up is about how Sam said that we  think of war, there is just a general idea of fighting that comes up in our mind.
I completely agree with that statement. he made in class completely.
My heart feels heavy just thinking about how Basim went through that something like that but he chose love over hate.
Hearing Rafi describe his life there. seeing pictures of his family really gave me a better understanding on. the vast majority of the country is like.
Being able to free those people from the fear they face every day should  be a main priority in the amount of time weve been over there.
Religion is changing vastly across the nation. we are seeing many more people joining our family. We do not believe in christianity.
This means radically changing our laws to those that are fitting with the bible.
Sam pointed out that we do adopt a Christian Sharia which our country we will be affectively pushing out country back into the past about 150 years.
I agree that it was nice to hear a different perspective on war.
I do not want to deny the idea of a God. I see many people preach this that. do not really follow everything their holy book tells them. it leaves me confused.
It disquiets me too,. Faith, we're able to put in others to guide our own.
We seek short cuts . convenience in every aspect of our lives. , even in relationships special as the one many of us hold with ahigherpower.
Sharia law really stops people from the way that they  want to live.
I absolutely love the way you explained your interpretation of the Bible. I loved your entire response.
I did a response on this video. I mentioned how important it is to stop passing judgment on the sins of others.
I believe some Christians pass this judgment it could stem from the version of Bible they read
Obviously that would be extremely hard to enforce. that is where it has to start.
It brought up an interesting thought. I was in the lecture.
How has our society turned into killing our own kind. destroying lives that are harmless?
we see attacks against us Americans. doesn't mean there aren't other Christians behaving the same. using their justification religion well.
It is extremely difficult to put my selves in their shoes without interacting. understanding what their lives are truly like.
Hearing from LTC Richard Garey was an eye-opening experience. He mentioned how rare combat was compared to how common many civilians think it is.
I thought this just went to show how off the American publics. perception of not only the Afghani people. the American soldiers is.
we really cared to look into how the war has affected the innocent lives over. there who just want their family to be safe. I do not think any single person would be in support of continuing war.
This is the problem. we discuss religion and people of religious faiths other than our own.
Being able to sit back actually study the religion to understand it  is what needs to be done
The fear built from the religious wars cause us to look at the extremist Islamic people. We apply that to every person from the religion.
Obviously, this is an issue. Not every person of Islamic faith is an extremist.
he gives examples of what those words mean in today's term
I instantly think of a better world without religion when this is brought up
some topics people will agree who with some topics Which people won't agree with.
history has contradicted those views
Understanding an entire country's way of life and seeing how different it can be from ours is something that is difficult for many people to grasp.
I'm not proud to admit  that I find it to be a common thread with my peers.
Similar to the Bible, the Quran was written a very long time ago. The Quran can be interpreted in many different ways.
these are two completely different religions they have fought wars with each other over their differences they still have so many similarities in their religions
There has been a fear of muslims. it has been going around the United States.
i had class. i discussed the topic of racism.
This is probably due to the board of education. The board of education believes this is not an issue in the community. This belief is because the community is primarily composed of all Whites.
who digging into the psychological roots of why racism is not tlked about much. which in our education system. who is that people never want to talk about something that they are ashamed about.
the topic isn't ever brought up because of their pride
This kind of street-level oppression might seem like history to someone in the U.S. . a similar kind of domestic terror is exactly what is happening to places like Afghanistan. its important to make that connection to improve one's understanding with empathy.
Which violent attacks are not written in the bible. Who are wrongfully interpreted.
The brief point of my response to the response is that  religion is something that people need to grow to an understanding
Which terrorism crusades that go on in our world They are key to how the people move  the perceive religion
Every time I interact with people from other cultures  that I am amazed by the different things we do.
I saw a foreign soldier on my property. I think that they are here to cause me harm.
It was powerful to hear that 99% of the interactions. the military personnel have with civilians in war zones is peaceful.
I thought they were more of a nuisance
I know the level of communication involved between civilians/soldiers is high. It made me realize the necessity of learning cultural cues.
It was a huge cultural development who greatly helped which soldiers in Afghanistan.
my family is from Puerto Rico. they only have Puerto Ricans that live on the island.
Sam brings up a point that  is very interesting here.
This is why this specific activity  was interesting.
You discuss think about things that youd never talk that think about in your everyday life.
This is a great response to this video. in most cases the Sharia law in lots of middle eastern governments is imposed by radicals who have taken power. many places do not accept gay marriage. punish it severely.
there are case where removing of a religion had destroyed society and culture of peace and justice
it is great they are so open to talk about their life stories
watching this video, some of the points were really interesting. I had a lot question in about it.
Its something that we can take pieces . apply to our lives.
This sounds completely obvious. only you fully put yourself in the shoes of a person like Ahmed Rafi. who has two young daughters with dreams, aspirations.
I agree with you. Stripped down, Christianity and Islam do not seem fundamentally very different.
I completely agree with you. I have never viewed the two religions similarly.
It is happening in our own country. where different religions are creating bias towards certain groups.
That is why they are able to maintain their straight hair despite living in a climate. which would have people evolve with more curly kinky hair.
And, whats more important, these customs which  the Bibles teachings can be interpreted in different ways.
Yes, the Taliban with ISIS are extreme groups that follow the Quran word. punishing those who dont do the same.
it may contain some law set to guide few people it could not be considered for everybody
everyone in the world does not have the same ideology, beliefs or culture
Sam, also, said about how different people interpret the Quran that   to bring a solution to unsolvable situation
These disagreements had been created. Sharia law has some things missing. Sharia law can't be considered worldwide.
I cant imagine. just inviting someone in my home casually.
My families pack tons of American souvenirs and products to give away
The Bible was written centuries ago. it means that what it says probably isnt very accurate.
in the bible there are 10 commandments they are laws that should be followed to avoid committing sin
This is a perfect example of how we can follow the ideas of the Bible. the actual laws stated in it arent needed to be followed strictly.
I love how people who have visited Afghanistan say that  they are the most welcoming genuine people
There are some major issues we face in society being women (and men). It needs to be discussed.
Just food for thought. Looking forward to seeing what Sam has in class next!
a man looking at a woman besides his wife would automatically be an adulterer
Homosexuals may be forced out of society
literal interpretation would alter what we consider as a christian
Today, there are many verses we fully disregard in our society. those aforementioned.
Few modern Christians follow the Bible, verbatim. Those who do, could be marked terrorists.
There are people that generalize that Muslims in this way.
I thought that it goes that way there. Hardly anything can be done.
But I started to see the slides of real people listen to that Mr. Rafi, I had many other thoughts through my mind.
Mr. Rafi, a lawyer, that can't lead a normal  simple life.
In this video, Sam is talking about how broad both of these books are. how differently they can both be interpreted.
One of the biggest arguments. The Bible raises is whether not God approves of gays.
Sam made it clear to me that The Quran is the same way,that it is  entirely up to the person reading it to find their own meaning amongst the words.
Your response was spot on. I was thinking.
I didnt get a chance to talk about this in my discussion group. I totally agree with everything youre saying.
the Quaran was written takes place during a time of war. many references are relating to violence with fighting.
I know i was raised catholic but have been to several other churches that were not Catholic attending many services in Synagogue with my Jewish friends.
both speakers came up in front. the clas explained their perspective on who the Afghan people. I was thrilled to hear what they had to say.
It is very unsettling knowledge. People should not have to live under circumstances that Afghan civilians do.
Taking this course has definitely opened my eyes in many different ways. in regards to how unaware we are.
I now know the importance of learning about people from difference place, different cultures and seeing things from their perspective
I have chosen to talk about the clip  what The Quran Says About Divorce.
I do not know much about Afghanistan at all. I quickly assumed that women barely had any rights in their country.
I am still waiting on the first woman president though.
this is why dr. richard first statement made me believe
I never realized how extremely seriously people took the Bible. They actually believe they should live through what the Bible says.
Since I grew up Catholic, I am technically a Christian.
However, the older I got the more I questioned. practiced my faith less.
the bible does not support many of these reasons
The Bible says things along the lines women were created to be the helper men. luckily that is not exactly how it is currently going women. they are fighting to increase our rights.
who i agree with your thoughts on this video which of how eye opening it is that whcih many people are hospitable generous
I feel the America is unlike this. it is shocking that these people can be welcoming to anyone  even strangers.
would be hard to make it one most likely not work. such a long time,  I think it would be something nice. try to moving forwards just a Sam says they do now.
I thought back to my religion reading your response
Just like you, the older I got the less that  I practiced my faith, beliefs.
I feel totally horrible there are just some things I do not agree with my religion
Many of these people who do believe this are Christians. in reality, the same thing is happening with Christianity.
Now no one said how to live,  that the world may have been more chaotic.
Rules that we cannot see with out eye.
you look deep into atoms you will find that. we area bunch of hydrogen.
Everything is our society is being ruled by sciences way of interacting energy. we choose to ignore it we will fight each other on our books of our ancestors.
We have no idea. it made up our rules that govern our nature.
By someones interpretation of the Quran that could be considered stealing that  may result in someones hand being amputated punishment.
interpretation of things are important it allows people to explore and debate different ideas
In my opinion, having different interpretations is a good thing.
it would be difficult for us to apply the constitution to today's social issues without being able to interpret it
Growing up, I was taught that people didn't get divorced. The only way people were to be separated was through an annulment. It meant something in the relationship was very, very wrong.
I often wonder about how people can say doing something one way versus another way is allowed.
who people whether they are jewish muslim who are allowed to believe what they chose. which believing in something comes along with actions.`
So, a result, they judge, critique. compare to their own traditions, beliefs.
But what Sams lecture taught me is. who are we to do all of those things.
Those people, whether its my new Muslim neighbor that my Jewish roommate, are doing the exact same thing, interpreting something choosing to believe in it.
That is what I am doing with the Bible. why cant they do the same with the Quran.
many argue against it. the bible is very much interoperable.
I think we should all just be more open minded. it comes to interpreting things like this.
I was raised Jewish. I no longer follow any religion.
I agree that we need to start being more understanding, accepting. remaining ignorant to one another.
Yes the world was changing. the book had to stay the same. the no matter what shit it has in it.
One person might firmly believe. Taking a random paperclip is stealing. Another person might think the opposite.
the world has evolved tremendously since Quran, Bible, and other religious books
how would such actions  that be accounted for?
the government would not be able to know about your sex life
Marissa, I completely agree . feel the same way about what you are saying.
Sometimes all we need is to take a step back. gain a different perspective.
my cousins had their bar mitzvahs, bat mitzvahs, communions. I sat respectfully in the crowd wondered. such a monumental part of someones life could be based off a single piece of writing.
It is comforting to know that generations are moving away from that  literal interpretations of the bible that could hurt others.
In summary, I believe in todays modern society people shouldnt live their lives solely based on religious writings
Christians living in America are going to interpret it way differently. people living across the globe.
Instead, it should be a guide to how you can live the best life that you  could possibly live.
I ignorantly thought and judged many things about Islam as a whole before introduced to it
youre not familiar with Abrahamic religions. the Islam is one of them.
many of the nicest people I met in middle east were muslims
the Bible calls for the death penalty for people They commit these crimes The crimes are cursing a parent, disobeying a parent, adultery, homosexuality and a woman losing her virginity before marriage
who had only thought that they both basically who have the same god had not considered the similarities which in ethical codes ideals.
As Americans, we take any violence mentioned in the Quran immediately conclude that is the reason why Islamists are radical and violent people
this class, I really never gave any thought to just how wrong our views on other religions could be. honestly, this I actually did believe that all Muslims prayed five times a day.
This gives us a general sense about something. It is about how to live our lives. This is very important and essential.
I have seen family such us my own struggle. financially, mentally but church always seemed like a place to relax the mind and find peace.
There are constantly arguments with those who are Christian. disagreements on how to interpret the bible.
which this is all subject who to interpretation in the same which way that the Quran is
Sam explained how the Bible, the Quran are similar in many ways. the idea of using a bible is the same in the Muslim societies toward the Quran.
I love how Sam compares excerpts from the Quran. the Bible alike. people don't realize how similar the two religions are.
Hence, Christians will only focus on the religious standpoint of the Bible. disclaim anything that has a negative connotation.
It really shows the negative stereotypes It shows how uneducated people are about religion and the Middle East itself.
I have many friends who are Muslim. they treat you like family every day. In America there's this constant fear-mongering. People are misinformed about the truth behind religion.
I think that put the topic of Sharia Law. the Quran into perspective.
I also agree with you in saying the role that the Quran should have in society regarding Sharia Law.
a guiding principle, it works. a legal system,  I do not necessarily see.
As unreligious person, I cant imagine saying that Im a part of a group with people. We are on the other side of the word committing massacres.
I have never been explored or influenced by another religion or someone in it
in reality, the people who are saying this have probably never explored other countries. gotten a different perspective from someone from a different country.
is there something that mentions. how to deal with online bullying harassment.
It would make it hard to come to a common agreement. How should each specific situation be treated.
who is a book that is not very long we can not address every possible situation that can occur in society today.
There are, indeed, some interesting rules associated with the Sharia law about the divorce.
Sam put statements on the board during this discussion. I will not likely enter heaven. All the people I spend time with would not be either.
That is not to say we aren't good people. It's just the way we live life.
I would not consider myself a religious person. I do value some of the things that the Bible says.
it's hard to apologize on behalf of history and the entire white community in my place
who opened this discussion with the myth Which that in Islam men can divorce their wives without any reason  who showed this was not the case
In the conclusion of the video Sam draws attention. many of our political leaders paint Islam to be a religion that follows antiquated rules. after this class, I can now see how similar our laws are to each other.
Some things got lost in translation
more of my rights will be take away if life is done by the bible
in my life. I have read the king James Version of the Bible in one year.
there are those people who call themselves. they are not really Christian.
When reading the bible what version or translation of the Bible is actually true?
I do not know if that makes a difference
living by the Bible can is hard that should not be done at all
Again, there are some things that are outdated and really old. It does not fit into what the world is today.
So why do we put so much faith into the Bible if we only selectively choose what to follow?
Don't get me wrong. The Bible or the Quran are certainly places for some amount of guidance. The Bible or the Quran should not be where 100% of someone's dependence lies.
The topic of divorce in Islam is very controversial. This is due to the fact that a man can basically instantly divorce his wife by repeating the word talaq three times.
I think that even the men, women have the same laws, they should both have go through some formal process to divorce.
I agree wholeheartedly with your statement. The information that is fed to us affects our view of Afghanistan so much.
However, I can now see. This is not even close to accurate.
I thought that this class was really powerful. As it broke down the walls of ignorance and misinformation that divide us.
Islam is stereotyped in Western societies.
The issue of race that weve learned about is very similar to the issue of religion in the world. There are slight differences that cause such great issues to people.
they could only see past the minute differences . relate to each other, there would be a lot more peace in the world.
Christianity is just so insane to me. I can not just say Christianity. We learned in class this day Muslim religion is practically saying the same thing.
This class was just proof to how far out the bible versus are and how many people would actually be going to heaven if heaven was real.
That is the percentage just in our classroom. I cannot imagine what it is within society.
I do not want to upset anyone or how they feel. I think religion is a wonderful thing. Has so much meaning spiritually.
Another thing that is crazy to me is how much Americans are ignorant to Muslim religion.
Everyone is so bias. Christians have the same thing going on. Certain people that change what the bible says. It states how to act.
People who argue that the Christian faith should be first foremost . the administration of this county need a serious reality check. running a nation based on a religion has failed throughout history.
In my opinion , people in power will use religion. It is a way to control the larger population. When there is no separation of church and state.
If religion is blended into government, it will be one of the greatest attacks on American liberties ever experienced.
This information may be otherwise censored by mass m.edia This information may be just thrown the back burner. It does not fit with the views or goals of modern news networks.
You explained that you are someone that looks at there own religion. You not take time to see another person's religious views.
I think that there are so many that do this in the world.
Everyone who thinks like this has just not explored the world . The possibilities they have!
he didn't talk about how the Afghan people weren't bad. I would have never believed two of my cousins who served over there a couple years ago.
They said some positive stuff. The families hosted dinner for the soldiers. The families gave them water, towels, etc.
I think the media plays a big role in that as well, because you always see news stories about soldiers being killed over there or bombings happening.
What you don't see is what those two videos showed. We had to watch it for the quiz.
Listening to Rafi made me think. more from a personal side.
Sam said in the video. most people think sharia law is backward, sometimes even wrong.
sharia law is based on The Quran, people would just assume that is Islam taught these Islamic people about these backward laws orders.
The Quran contains fables. They teach people about good morals.
Most of the time, people tend to use religious texts. People support their acts. People justify their wrongdoings.
There are individuals. They use religion to achieve their personal desire.
Henry VIII, for example, initiate the English Reformation. Henry VIII separated the Church of England from papal authority. It was an effort to have an annulment with his first wife, Catherine of Aragon.
It all comes back to the point that we should not stereotype a religion because of what we heard about it.
I am assuming this is why religion cannot be brought back into schools.
I see public officials bringing. the religion into their points though.
Its ethically and morally wrong to have a bible based world. Not everyone believes in the same things.
It is breaks my heart to see. religious freedom bills from various states that go against same sex couples.
The one from Georgia that Sam read to us really shocked me.
Essentially it says that religious priests can deny a couple just because they dont follow their same religious beliefs.
Christian sharia can deny you from employment. Your religious beliefs don't align with the companys.
I hope that more people can get educated on Sharia Law and the Establishment Clause. One day we won't have to worry about stuff like this.
However, the Quran does recognize that separation is a possibility between a husband and wife.
I think people, myself included, may have had an idea that  in Islam the man holds all the power.
I find the concept that when a woman does want a divorce, she is not guaranteed it to be wrong.
This is what is wrong with the world.
It is sad to see. People use religion to achieve their personal desire.
I feel like that is a common occurrence back when.
For example, President Trump uses specific words and connotations when talking about Islam or Mexicans that creates fear and uncertainty in the eyes of the American people.
As citizens we all must be aware of these potential threats against our liberties. We must be able to realize when someone is fabricating an enemy through fear and uncertainty to control us.
I went to a Catholic high school. I have been told for four years that the Bible is where we base our moral knowledge off of.
When Sam started bringing up different situations that were obviously unable to be answered using the Bible or the Quran alone, I felt puzzled.
However, I do believe that we can use the stories and lessons from the Bible to infer what we should do in these specific situations that we cant find in the Bible.
I do think that Sam refers to this exact idea at the end of the video when he says, Sharia law, what is it is taking this book and saying, look, its filled with a lot of stories.
Both Christians and Muslims have interpreted their books in a way that has led them to engage in violence and destruction.
Why do we neglect to talk about this, as much as we do, when it comes to Sharia law?
Both the Quran and the Bible are subject to peoples OWN interpretation of what is written inside them.
Specifically, seeing the images of Rafi that young children sparked emotions of sadness within me.
I think this is. These pictures really helped me to make connections to aspects of my own life.
It is upsetting to imagine the childhood that some children in Afghanistan. they are forced to have due to this war.
In my opinion, I have never really been able to make real connections with war. I feel as if I am so distant from all of the actual violence.
War affects everyone. When the actual violence is taking place in your country, the regular civilians can be affected just as much as the people fighting in the wars.
one of the audio recordings suggested for the first quiz in this class. Al Letson, repeated the notion that Trump continually denies the issue of white and Christian extremism in America.
However, as shown by the classes responses to the claims of the Bible. Fre people follow the text so strictly.
One can assume that many students in the lecture identify as Christians. The standards set out by the Bible were still seemingly absurd to them based on their collective reactions.
Sam is right when he says it is real and involves real people.
Their reality is not knowing if they will die when they step out of their houses.
I hope to make myself more aware of what is happening in places like this.
I hope to educate myself. I can spread the word. I can help others be more aware.
War is not just this thing that is out there, it is real.
How can people who do such good work end up dead fighting in a war?
I don't think anyone can really follow word for word what the Bible and Quran are telling people to do. Beliefs are too different now. For rules in the Bible and Quran to try and interpret the sacred books.
I think that most religions are all saying the same.
I really think of the fact that Afghanistan is more progressive than us
The United States always tends to feel they are the best. We are actually moving backwards.
I totally agree with people wanting to express their religion. There cmeos a point where it is just too far.
Another thing within the video that struck me was the laws that Georgia is passing.
This shows that the United States is in fact moving backwards rather than moving forward with time. That is something that needs to be talked about.
If people really want to follow the books in that way. They can't pick and choose the topics. That are going to be more wrong than others.
The books say gay marriage is illegal but they also so many other things. Like, the examples Sam put on the board.
No one is ever making a big deal about any of those issues.
He has almost become accustomed to the life he lives.
Basically the fact that. he life is waiting a game.
He continues to put his life on the line every day.
He even mentioned that. his wife did not want continue this.
This is not something that we, in the United States, are used to.
There is bad happening all around us even when we do not know it.
Through my personal observations, the media likes to paint groups in stark contrasting ways.
I start thinking about the point of this class. I begin to think that we may have something that works here, That doesn't mean we should take it upon ourselves to change how everyone else in the world acts.
I realize a certain pattern in commentators I listen to looking back
Most of the base agreed that both Christian,  Muslim law could not solely run a government.
I have since learned from my mistakes.
I decided to look into it found that, like Sam showed us in class, that a lot of the hate groups in the Middle East form in some of  that the same way gangs do in America.
Young men that are down in their luck or born in poor situations are promised a future and power.
There are many cases of Christian Sharia that are working in the American government right now. This is ridiculous considering how hypocritical it is.
Too many want the Christian religion to be intertwined into life here in America. the very people are almost disgusted by the same thing happening with Islam in the Middle East.
At the end of the day the establishment clause was created to keep this very thing from happening. Ensuring that no religion took precedence over another. Christianity has always remained the most favorable.
In what world is discrimination justifiable in this instance compared  to it was based off of the color of ones skin example?
You make a relevant point. I think I did not initially think this way because I have a different background. That can limit me from thinking from different perspectives.
Back to your point, I wonder how we can solve this issue. Religions group people who believe different things.
The Sharia law uses the Quran to understand how to build a lifestyle.
I was trying to understand if it promoted a form of government. From the class lecture, I concluded that it didn't.
One thing that stuck out during the discussion is that we all have the ability to have our own religious beliefs.
A lot of people use religion as a way to guide their life and choices. It is important to understand what motivates other people.
Its obvious that our class is full of diversity. It proposes different opinions and beliefs.
Some of the reasons are torture and health which make sense . another one is that the husband cannot provide.
It is odd to think that one universal term such as marriage can be so similar yet so different.
I never really knew anything about divorce. I never knew that these laws existed. I think that waiting a certain amount of years is helpful to the relationship. They could work things out. and eventually feel the need to not divorce.
Yet I was fully aware of the violence that was being committed by Muslims and others under the Taliban ISIS rule.
If the media wont make Christians look bad. They'll put it on another religious group like Islam. To prove that Americans and Christians in general. Are more superior and commit no crime.
I always thought the bible was the bible. It really only had one way to interpret it. It evidently does not only have one way to interpert it. Groups like white supremacists and the alt right read a passage in the bible that says its acceptable to hate and kill others based on the color of their skin or what religion they practice.
Another Christian could read the same passage. Another Christian could interpret it as God wanting them to give back to their community.
I personally think religion is important because it shapes peoples lifestyles and choices.
I do think it is interesting. People of the same group can act differently.
Whether it is religion or a completely different topic, we will never get anyone to fully agree on everything.
I also like how you talked about how people turn to religion for good. It is the backbone behind many conflicts and disagreements.
Religion is a complex ideology. Religion becomes personal to the individual's lifestyle.
The video link you included was interesting. It tried to make sense of conflict that arises. There are many different beliefs. Different beliefs can be centered on the same concepts.
I dont think people should be generalized based on the group they are in from their religion.
Through the media, some religions become generalized. being bad based on the actions of an individual,small group of people.
Thats why I find it hard  to believe in Sharia law.
These speakers who came to class show us that not everyone is bad.
I find it humbling. They are a very gift-giving country.
That was one major thing that I wont forget.
It changed the world. Sixteen years later, it is one of, if not the biggest thing that has happened in the past two decades to affect the world.
We went to war after the attacks on the World Trade Centers. All sorts of scary things happened.
I remember hearing about the attacks going on across the world because of how mad Americans were.
this class I really started to wonder why everyone thought that it was alright to do this.
In class I really started to understand. Sam was angry. Sam was frustrated.
We went to war right away. Many innocent people were killed.
I think there needs to be more conversation going on.
The things you read in the Bible, or other religious literatures should be taken with a grain of salt.
An example of what I try to follow is the Ten Commandments.
Those who do could find themselves jailed.
Hardship of the variety that he described is so far removed from what we are accustomed to in our modern American society.
I could have been born to different parents and have a completely different reality as well, one closer to what he has experienced.
Basim's life story reminds me again why wars should not be fought. Wars should not be fought how they are fought now.
Everyone grows up with some sort of beliefs. That is usually what they go by as they get older.
That is why this class discussion is important Class discussion broaden our minds. We really question those things we have grown wo live by.
My only input is that not everyone is perfect. As humans, we are going to make mistakes. Go against things from what the Bible says at some point.
That is something I question. to the Bible.
Back in the day everything that the Bible says was way more enforced than it is now.
I believe what the Bible says. It's not the same. Someone else might believe.
I think that is why so many people may feel uncomfortable with talking about it as well.
Im not really sure where someone reads in the bible that they should kill people who arent like them.
I found it very interesting. Muslims and Christians do not have completely different beliefs.
It actually makes me really happy that they are similar religions. I think when more people learn that, it could really bind them together. Also maybe give people more of an understanding of the radicalization of their religions.
There is this strange divide between Christians and Muslims. That is really misunderstood, in my opinion.
I feel the same way that you do.
I found it really interesting. We had such similar ways of living. I never thought that we did.
That is mainly because I only ever saw the bad things happening. I never thought that we could be so similar.
I think that it was really nice to have Ravi come in our class. Ravi helped us to understand what exactly life is like in Afghanistan. How their religion and things in their every day life work.
However, until this part of the lecture in class I never thought about the bible in the way Sam way conveying.
I thought so as well the bible is about god and jesus I should follow as it should be true and correct
I understand now. I can open up. It is better to talk about issues.
I consider myself a Catholic. I fail to make it to mass every week.
It is so hard to take the Bible word for word. I like the examples that you have laid out.
I have done many things that the bible condemns. I dont think that makes me a bad person.
I still have my faith. I attend mass as often as I am able. If I were to take the bible word for word I would be a horrible person, according to some of its writings.
I found this interesting. I have often wondered how to categorize the extreme Christian organizations.
essentially attempting to implement the exact same thing. a different book.
I think tha Americans see these groups differently because of the moral that our country was founded on .
We had a war on terrorism. Where were we fighting abroad in the Middle East?
I was never taught about how European settlers acted like the Americas were uninhabited when they discovered them.
It makes my blood boil when people talk about slavery as just history. Think about it, would it really be that easy for you? Could you not draw connections between then and now? Even if your history was that gruesome? relevant to your day to day life?
It's definitely not a one-and-done situation. We commit one sin. We receive one blowjob. We can't get through the gates in heaven.
The Quran is a book of teachings. It is meant to explain how people should live their lives.
The two sound extremely similar. As long as no one is forcing their beliefs teachings on anyone. There should be no judgement.
Everyone has done something in their particular holy book that is wrong. This means everyone is going to hell.
The judgement comes from those who speak without having knowledge on religions other than their own.
If everyone was aware that these two different religions are ultimately created by two extremely similar books. I think a lot of peoples opinions would be changed.
Being able to seethat the points Sam made between both books were similar  to one another really makes you question the point of having conflict that  different religions in the first place.
It is an excellent novel. It is clearly not representative of at least a majority of Afghan marriages and divorces.
This is the second week in a row. I've been really shocked. Islam culture and American culture are similar to each other.
There are only the four reasons why she can say she desires a separation. Torture, the man being unable to have sex. The man being unable to provide financially. The man simmply leaving his wife without explanation.
The dynamic in the United States is different in that the divorce rate goes up almost every year. About 50% of all marriages end in divorce. Both genders have the same rights in deciding to go through with a separation.
In some senses the United States Law is more backwards. The United States Law has more loopholes than we wish.
We live in a completely different world. the time period where it was written.
1st century Christianity is still present in a 21st century world. 1st century Christianity is filled with tens of different religions and beliefs being expressed in just the United States.
This class has enlightened me in seeing different perspectives. I can relate in your feelings about what the class is bringing you mentally and emotionally.
Sam's points in this video were actually true. He made us see Christianity in new a point of view. I've never thought about that before.
It's not that we are selectively religious. Some people do consider themselves strict with their religion. They are only strict in certain aspects.
That was what I was always taught. Thats how I interpreted the Bible.
That is how they interpreted the readings.
I personally think the picture with people sitting around praying, reading is the correct way to practice it.
Ive come to learn that unless Jesus comes back and tells us the right way. We are constantly going to be in disagreement.
At first, this concept was very hard for me to understand. I was raised being taught that it was clear which way to act.
Thats why I really enjoyed this lecture. It showed me how the other side thinks. It is able to justify their way of thinking.
That's why I feel like there should be no arguments surrounding. This all deals with personal preference.
society is continually growing and changing to fit different norms of this world
Many people may agree or even disagree with me. That is the way it is meant to be. It is all about interpretation.
However, the same passage has the power to confuse someone.
In example, the Bible says people cannot be gay, does  that mean anyone who is gay will go to hell?
I honestly do not think so, but who knows?
It is how you interpret these books that dictates how you behave.
Some Christians take the bible word for word. They believe that anyone who is gay or gets divorced will not get into heaven. Some interpret it more loosely. They don't necessarily believe that.
it is unfair to the whole group when their reputation is determined by only a portion of the group.
When you think about it as if it were happening to you, you realize how incredibly terrible it is.
It really clicked for me when Sam showed us the pictures of Mosul.
I think we need to make more people realize the terrible things happening to the civilians in the Middle East. There is not enough awareness of what those people are going through on a daily basis.
All of these common factors are pointed out. There will inevitably be people who deny this. They will become angry.
I do believe that killing innocent civilians who had nothing to do with 9 11 was horrible.
These people living in Afghanistan are not all bad,. It's something that a lot of Americans need to understand. Come to terms with.
find there to be issues with people attempting to live out the Bible 100 percent. Very, very old terms come into play. Standards come into play.
I believe that the general motive and ethics behind the Bible and Gods word is what needs to be lived out and, actually, without much interpretation.
Not all Muslims are terrorists. Not all Christians are supremacists.
In all honestly, I really have not since I was little . It is like it did not matter because it was not directly affecting me.
He is a parent. He had to worry about his daughters.
I really cannot imagine it. His best friend was murdered.
I think it is really cool how Sam brings in these special guests. I think it is really cool how these special guests share their stories. It makes everything so much more impactful.
I also just appreciate these special guests for taking time out of their day to talk to us because I do not think they know how impactful they can be.
Arianna, the things that youve mentioned actually sound rather similar to my reply on this thread. I'm thankful that we share two different viewpoints that are very much identical.
I found this lecture very interesting. I grew up only knowing the Bible.
I would like to learn more about every religion. It is interesting to me.
I do not think it is fair how we judge people just from what we hear.
I went to church when I was younger. I got baptized. I was confirmed.
He asks us to imagine using the Quran to adjudicate any legal situation.
I remembered at the beginning of the video he said that the  Quran New Testament are very similar.
Sam mentioned The Georgia Bill at the end saying that its legal for a religious leader to deny performing a marriage ceremony for someone conflicting with their beliefs.
The second law about faith based organizations not having to offer social, educational. charitable services to people who are in opposition to their world view is straight inhumane.
I find this devastating that it is actually coming from somewhere in America.
I'm sure plenty of people are aware of it but the same amount, if not more, are unaware of it or ignore it.
Sharia law prevents people from believing what they want unless they support the version of Sharia ruling the nation.
States that have passed Religious Freedom Bills. The states should abolish them at once.
the majority students at my high school were Catholic. agreed with every aspect of Catholicism. including to the teachers.
religion is interpreted literally but differently by so many people
It blows my mind that two individuals can dislike each other because of how they interpret a religion.
It can be understood. It can be utilized an infinite amount of ways. Why does that matter?
Religion was never meant to be a divisive tool. Religion is something to bring structure. Religion is to serve as a moral compass.
I think our responses are pretty similar. I mentioned the people of the United States. Freedom isnt based on a rule book.
People still attempt to do exactly this.
It seems that this form of governing creates more issues than it solves. Some people will interpret the scriptures differently than others. Have arguments about who is correct.
It discriminates against other religions. It forces them to obey laws of one religion.
This may just be because I am not very educated when it comes to different religions. I am pleased to know that women have the same rights as men.
I also learned that when divorce occurs in Afghanistan, it is very similar to what happens when people get divorced the U.S.
I find this to be very interesting. I highly doubt this is practiced in America.
I am curious to know if court is involved at all with divorce in Afghanistan. In America, courts are used in nearly every divorce.
After this lecture. I began to think that the message african americans are trying to send. Not that only black lives matter but that their lives do matter. In our society it can feel like this is not the case.
I agree we always celebrated Columbus day. In high school only had a small chapter in history class that addressed the inhumane ways the native Americans were treated.
However I do believe that the founding of America was a positive turning point for the world.
It took way too long for blacks to be given the right to vote. Blacks weren't considered a full human which is complete uncalled.
I had always picture the KKK as a relatively small group who did terrible things.
I use other sources of information to back up my opinions. That is what I believe most Christians should do. The person you debate against would not listen to your argument.
Turning the tables and making it so that the white people have the ancestors who were enslaved by black people forced people (at least me personally) to think about things in a different perspective.
I obviously was always aware of the issue of racism. I never truly thought to put myself in other peoples shoes who were experiencing racism and discrimination. I have never experienced it myself.
These things sound so ridiculous when watching it in Sams exercise. What is very alarming is the fact that these are real comments that have been made by white people toward black people getting targeted by police officers
When seeing things in a different light, it made my mind really think. I have found myself yet again feeling guilty for not understanding how ignorant and rude so many white people are. I wonder why this is a problem that has yet to go away.
If people were more educated and aware of how unfairly people were being treated, I believe there could be a difference in the way a lot of people think today.
Sam says that the Quran is the New Testament are not that different. from a sociologists perspective.
Why do Americans oppress Muslims? They, too, believe that Jesus is a holy man.
The Quran is also a book of stories and teachings to help people understand how to live and succeed in life, just like the Bible.
Sharia Law is based on the Quran. The Quran is used as a general template for the justice system.
This is discrimination towards women. They are not receiving equal power. They are not getting power men are getting.
That is very strange. in our culture I feel like a lot of people just give up on their marriage. They get a divorce without trying.
Include the thought that the male has more power in the society than women.
At where I come from which is China. There is still something about divorce that affect the female more than the male. Even now in this modern day.
There still are lots of females who are afraid to say divorce to their husband.
That doesn't mean I followed every single one.
I believe the Bible is just a guide to life.
That is why I really think the Bible and Christianity is less strict than Islam and The Quran.
I believe Muslims are more devoted to their religion. There's ONE version of their religion.
Its hard to follow all the rules because sinning is an easy thing to do.
We do things we say we can't.
I believe it shows you examples on how to live a Christian life and make it to Heaven. When my savior is ready to come save us.
I believe it teaches you not to do bad things. Possibly could end up in Hell with Satan.
If I was to choose, I believe I would've been a muslim from birth. They are more devoted and serious about Islam.
In my life I was questioning that myself  it due to conversations with my mother.
She was really against any other religions. She was very concerned. I talk to people with different religious background.
Is it a good thing or bad? We will find out in death. We all will die eventually, right Samuel Richards?
The only different thing is the leader we follow.
He comes back to describe the outside world to the mino. The mino pictures everything and everyone with a fish body.
Sam talks about how we are fish. We have not left our waters. We do not realize anything. A culture comes in. points something out to us.
We should not look at it as negative. It is how Christians would view the Old Testament.
We look different. We may have different opinions on things. There is a separation between cultures.
If everyone looked past that, we may all live in a peaceful world without war.
You remember Afghan people in the 60s. They most likely did not have strict laws.
People are trying to leave these countries. This means forcing something against their will is not really working out.
I wouldve not listen to the advice from the bible that says if you were hit on the right side of your face turn your left side and let that person hit you, because God will save you later.
it was interesting hearing jesus mentioning in a book where he is not considered the son of god
This chooses to neglect the parts of the Bible that were considered unsavory. For the most part, it wasn't until I left the church. I really learned about the negative parts of the bible.
Thank you for bringing up the comparison between the Quran and the New Testament.
I believe that we simply take the best of the teachings from  that both religious documents, the messages would likely be very similar.
I do not feel any sort of hatred toward the group. I believe many of the generalizations that are tossed around.
For the most part, in America the husband and wife are both able to file for divorce.
There is obviously a process that it must go through before it is official. Sometimes this process is messy and lengthy.
However, people still appreciate the shared power of men and women.
She can also choose to just leave. She would have to forfeit the money promised at marriage.
He has to pay for all of the wifes needs for 6 months. He has to take care of all of the needs of the children for 16 18 years.
In America, I know there are divorce settlements. They vary on a case to case basis.
In America, there is this view that Muslim women are completely oppressed, but in reality, it is not that way.
This is true when it comes to divorce. This is true in many other aspects of life.
He says that God wants you to read the Bible appropriately. What is the appropriate way to read it?
I did some research. I found some controversial bible passages.
He would not hearken to her prayers. Being stronger overpowered her and lay with her [II Kings 13:14].
It's a way to get through tough days It's a thought to hold onto.
Lastly, I just want to ask to those who are religious - why do you believe and what about your sins?
People I trust as friends who did that to me.
For awhile it was hard for me to believe in the Bible because of what happened to me.
I agree on everything you have written.
I liked that they were so connected to their religion and god that they wore a hijab every day.
The conversation between the white girls and the Muslim girls was extremely interesting to me . They asked most of the questions that I was thinking in my head.
I feel like western culture is very into looks and fashion and their appearance. The hijab is a good way to avoid this.
Of course the girls want to look good thats not the only thing they care about.
I give the girls so much power for wearing the hijabs.
I had no idea that other countries had to pay child support just like America. I think it makes sense considering it's their child.
However, I found out that it is a part of Islamic law, derived from the Quran and the Hadith.
I found it interesting how there are many similarities between Islam and Christianity. Before this class, this is something that I would not even imagine.
Extremists have altered the perspective of this religion.
In life, I feel as though many read what they want to read. Many hear what they want to hear.
You made really cool comparison with that childrens book.
That idea really resonated. me Rafi came in to talk to us.
I always assumed that women just could not show any skin, I did not think it would be for religious reasons.
All of the girls are proud too, I thought it was great that they were able to discuss and educate the whole class on the background of the hijab.
I have never learned anything about muslim religion before they are actually similar in some ways according to Sam's comparison of the bible and the Quran
Raffi cleared this up in lecture. Raffi explained what Muslims actually follow in the Quran. Raffi explained the version the Taliban pressures them to follow.
They have standard beliefs similar to the Christian religion. Which is something I would never in a million years assumed.
It is extremely important not to judge something you aren't familiar with. This is something I've taken away from the class.
It was funny when he asked the class who is going to heaven based on what was listed on the screen. I think one person in the entire room raised their hand.
I too found it incredibly amazing and eye opening that nobody actually truly knows what Jesus would want them to do. Unless he were to come back and tell each person how to act and practice their faith.
we will always argue as human beings
The words written in each of these books are subject to their own personal interpretation. Until people realize that these books were not written to govern bodies of people. There will continue to be strife and sides taken on this matter.
This goes to show what the civilians in Afghanistan are really like. This goes to show the character that they uphold.
I think that he started the class really well. He was talking about some of the stereotypes we associate with Sharia law. They come up whenever we hear the term.
It is also viewed as a negative thing here in the west.
dr richard pointing out how similar the quran and bible are is helpful
They are used as a guide in how to live in the world we do ethically today and also where we are going in the future.
It is also neat to consider the value of interpretation in regards to the way we live our lives.
Though I was raised in the Middle East, in Dubai, I had no idea that Afghanistan had malls and extravagant houses.
I always thought it was one of the most war-torn countries. The country has zero to little development.
What really bothers me is when innocent lives are killed. When people with good intentions are murdered.
Rafis partner, Rahin was killed for his attempt of bringing peace. This really hurt me.
I never understood the concept of what U.S. soldiers do in Afghanistan so I did some research and found out that U.S. soldiers are trying to protect Afghanistan from constant threat by remaining al Qaeda fighters and feuding warlords.
I agree with everything that you said Jill. This part of the class also resonated with me. I thought that it was also very interesting
I think that Dr. Richards did a good job. Dr. Richards showed how there are going to be extremists in any religion. This is something that is not just associated with Islam.
I was intrigued. The point you made about American divorces.
It is interesting. See the differences between the two countries.
In my discussion group, one of the black devils was in my class. talked about how they had scripts to follow, which makes sense. I wanted to hear more from them.
He should definitely do this again. I think a few adjustments would make it much more interesting.
I personally do not agree with this Bible verse. If this were true, there would not be a single person in this world going to Heaven.
People cannot help who they love or want to be with and to punish them with going to Hell for loving someone of the same gender is not what I believe God would say.
I believe that he loves all his children especially if they are good people.
I have a cousin who is gay. He is also extremely religious. He is dedicated to his family.
he goes to church every sunday, wear his gold cross around his neck every day, and has sunday dinner with his family every sunday as well saying he will not go to heaven just because he is gay is an outrage to me
I do not care what you practice. Do not force Bible stories down my throat.
In this class period, Sam asked Rafi why he continues to do work that threatens his life and his family.
Rafi has a beautiful response that said, if not me than who
Theres so many things going on in our world. It's not threatening our lives. There is something we can do to fix it.
Whether we see someone being discriminated against because of their gender or religion or sexual orientation, Rafi insists that its our job to be the change we want to see.
I personally think this is a lot easier said than done. I personally think this is a lot easier when I try to put myself in Rafis shoes.
I know people who join the military in the US accept this kind of threat. They are protecting themselves with weapons. Whereas Rafi just tries to stay peaceful
Anyway, its really just the desperation in Rafis voice that made me so emotional listening to his speech.
I agree completely as those books lead to various interpretations that can be considered erroneous from both sides.
Due to their conciseness and lack of detail. These books can be manipulated to morally police people who don't follow their interpretations.
Now to go off on a different tangent. A lot of people make their religion dominate their life too much.
From what I have seen, what every religion says is to be a good person that dont screw someone elses life.
If you are an atheist it is easy for you!
Rafi is just a humble man begging the world to be a more peaceful place. If my country is trying to silence people who share his viewpoints I dont understand how we can call ourselves the home of the free.
We are a predominantlyChristian nation. founded on Christian principles.
Maybe its because at that point in time humans did not fully understand the capacity of their minds but they attributed all their ideas to, hearing it from God.
I really enjoyed this clip. Sam changed the perspective. We use the Bible in Christianity to adapt it to make it work for Sharia Law.
I think that the Muslim religion is commonly associated with a negative stigma of Sharia Law in the United States . That is not the case for every person who practices the Muslim religion.
The issue with that is everyone reads the Quran with all different interpretations just like the bible.
Christians view Sharia law with such a negative outlook. If we used the Bible to run a country, it would look very similar to Sharia Law.
It is hard to image how life would be. The Bible was the main source. The Bibles was the guideline for our law system.
It is so hard to connect with what is happening in the middle east when you do not have any immediate connection to the war that is happening there.
Being able to know someone directly affected really moved me.
It got me thinking on how little the US does a country  in order to help out the people whos lives they have ruined
It is perplexing that Americans see our involvement as justified.
All the destruction we cause. Oil is a natural resource. Oil is prominent in a country that is not America.
Why are we allowed to take someone elses resources by force it makes no sense to me?
The economy, social work, and education have all been impacted by the war.
This is something that never really crossed my mind.
It is easy to put myself in their shoes. I think about my neighborhood, my family, my friends.
LTC Garey told the story of the village elder. The village elder will be compliant with any side that is imposing their will on the village.
I to started questioning my religion last year. I realized there are so many holes in it. I realized it sometimes contradicts itself.
Honestly, at the end of the day that  everybody is just trying to have an enjoyable meaningful life
He talks about how every Christian interprets the Bible differently.
This is just one example of Christians even in the same denomination. Christians have different views on social issues. They have different views due to their specific interpretation of the Bible.
This would be extremely hard because people of all religions interpret their version of the Bible differently. Even if they classify themselves as the same religion.
This applies to Muslim society us well. Quran does not explain all specific details about everything, either.
If the Bible were specific enough to describe every situation without any room for interpretation,. There would be less argument against what each passage means.
For one book to explain everything would solve a lot of issues, but people would still find ways to bend it to serve their own purposes.
It is all true in the sense of the word because it is all relative to different people.
I agree. Living life as the Bible would have us live is a ridiculous way to go about living.
I grew up Christian as well. I barely go to church anymore. I question faith.
The Bible's teachings will always be important. As the world changes faith needs to account for these changes as well.
this is a common theme I found in my eccentric sociology class
Sam will always force conversations with people about the very reason they are hesitant to start a conversation in the first place.
let me say this kind of thing has changed my perspective on so many things
We have to talk about the stuff that makes us uncomfortable. Race and cultural relations will not improve.
The American women literally put themselves in someone elses shoes (hijab) and walked around.
The problem why these people are not being equated to ISIS is because they are white, not Jewish though.
In result, the people can somehow, atleast  by some convoluted way relate to twisted people like Neo Nazis.
This is why SOC 119 is important for getting people to understand all sides
I remember this class very well and thought it was interesting.
I agree with your thoughts on how Americans fail to recognize extremist in the United States who practice Christianity. I actually wrote about that in my first response as well.
I think in reality both Islam and Christianity are very similar. People are unwilling to see that. They do not want to explore other religions.
religion one practices. it is all based off of your interpretations. vary from person to person no matter what religion it is.
Ive always wondered how a person or a group of people can read the Quran or the Bible and interpret it in the way that they do.
In some cases, they will torture kill people in order to get  that people to submit to their extremist views of their religion.
Both the Taliban and Christian extremist groups have killed, even slaughtered, those who didn't believe in their version of religion. Both the Quran and Bible enforce that people shouldn't kill.
I agree with everything you are saying. It's nice to know that this class is impacting everyone. Making us all think outside of the box.
I grew up catholic. I do not follow it anymore.
I also find it strange that it seems like religion in the west is laid back now compared to earlier generations.
It is really sad that people will use their religion as an excuse to discriminate against others. People end up doing things that totally go against other teachings in the bible.
There are even pastors who will not marry two because of different Christian denominations.
I do agree with you. We could be moving backwards.
I'm not just talking about one specific party either.
Not pursue violence. simply we disagree.
When leaving this lecture discussion I was left with the overall thought that is that religion can be a good guide for many but can also be an evil curse and excuse for others to act in barbaric ways
In order to stop this religion needs to return to its original meaning of peace and unity. Adjust to the changes in society today. Or, the threatening hostility levels will continue to grow.
About 8 years ago, my family and I traveled to New Mexico. There we visited reservations where Native American tribes were still living.
Both of these issues, genocide against Native Americans and slavery. Are the reason why race is such a big issue in America.
Women have the right to divorce whoever they want, similar to the United States.
It would be interesting to see if other western countries grant women the same rights; such as Saudi and Yemen.
it is ridiculous how much of the bibles teaching is up to interpretation and manipulation having been raised as a catholic
It is also easy to see only extremes. We are only looking at passages without their knowing their background.
However, it also allows us to see similarities between different groups.
Sam's test in class on who was going to go to Heaven on that criteria alone is very accurate.
By that criteria alone Not many people would be going to Heaven. Especially with how society and the media promote some of those acts.
If you killed or captured enough of your opposing forces troops, eventually they will give in.
However in more recent years, late 20th Century and in to the 21st Century, this status quo has changed; warfighting is no longer conventional.
they will and don't sometimes
We now have to learn about the culture of the people we are fighting against We have to understand the culture of the people we are fighting against.
In a complex world, winning by mean of unified land operations requires more than that.
It is also about winning the hearts and minds.
I am not an expert on Islam. I am fairly confident it is the same. Muslims can choose how religious they would like to be.
A prime example of this (Im pretty sure someone during class said this), is that a Muslim said they do not pray five times a day like you would typically expect.
When Sam began to talk aboutAfghanistan, he asked the question, When someone says Afghanistan, what do you think?
It made me want to become more aware of the fact that Afghanistan isn't just some country far away that gets bombed, and that is filled with war.
There are two things that I took away from this video.
The other thing that I took away from this lesson is that if we wanted to be involved we can.
You brought a lot of ideas to the table. I completely agree with them.
The idea that people should live their lives based on a book, has always amazed me.
life would not be as interesting if everyone were to follow rules of the bible or the quran
That is what makes life what it is.
What I find ridiculous is that people spend their time worrying about whether others are following the rules or are living their lives as they please.
We do not push it to the extreme. We have to think twice on whether it is a sin. The act should not occur.
I like your point on how it is important to know that different religions are interpreted in different ways.
I liked your connection to the Bhagavad Gita and was thinking about this while watching the video.
If you interpret it exactly, it talks about how Pandavas and Kauravas engage in war on each other (fighting their own families) but if you understand the situation, it is advising to take situations carefully.
Not I decided to read a novel. that was written by Afghani writer.
And how one of them was a rich one while the other was the son of the rich family servant.
I cannot describe how I felt when I was reading that book.
I cried severely in the sorrow moments and I smiled hard in the happy ones.
I always got the sense that religion stayed out of places dealing with the government. I never knew that there was an actual piece of legislature saying that its not allowed.
If This really was actually kind of surprising to me and considering the amount of religion that is used in political campaigns and such.
I understand that people can like a candidate due to their religion. It's not like they would be able to bring any of the aspects of that religion into their position in the government. Why does it even really matter?
The fact that this man, who was involved with the trump administration, is even respected in any way, is ridiculous.
Hi Alex, I liked what you wrote. I just want to clarify things out.
For Shia it is slightly different. There is not divorce if the man just said the word. It has to be in court.
Hope you this help you to understand. divorce is not some easy thing in Islam.
However, it is at the choice. your own free will to do so.
can I understand Sams perspective that the Bible may not be specific enough that it caused it to be open to personal interpretations
The Bible was written from a historical event.
The Bible is not a guideline on how to deal with specific situations. Otherwise, the bible would have been a book with infinite pages that no one would read.
I was taught to believe that we are born initially as sinners.
Iindividual to see if they want to change and live the Christian function.
I agree with you. People are really good at appearing very religious. People have proven not to be religious based on their behind the scenes activities.
If thats the case, then it is not faith. It's simply a coping mechanism by appearing religious.
I do agree with everything you are saying.
Isn't the end goal of believing in something the same for every religion?
So when the establishment clause comes up. It almost seems like it isn't very effective. The vast amounts of Christians.
Looking more closely, one can tell. Various religions are being more accepted here everyday.
I can see the issue of religion from many different view points. I can for sure say I agree with your view point.
It was shocking to hear from someone who experienced this first hand. He believes that Mosul will not be a habitable area for about another year.
It was good to see that the country was making steps in the right direction toward recovery. Bosim hopes that in four months he will be able to move back home. Bosim hopes he will begin a life in Mosul again.
I agree heavily with what Sam said at the end that history is hard to study. currently we are living it.
It just shows how much the country changed in just sixteen years. Many people are blind to the conflicts that occur frequently in the Middle East.
Eeveryone lived behind the words. Used them as a guidebook for daily lives. There is no room for exploration. Expression on how we make decisions.
time changes, innovation increases, education is expanded. individuals are able to expand knowledge on not only subjects in school. about religion, mold their own views regarding it.
We all cannot have cookie cutter minds to make decisions. Life is about failure and expedition personally, religiously, and in any sector of life we come across.
Nonetheless it was an intriguing idea to me before. I knew that back then. Christians and Catholics use to have wars and kill each other
He turned to his religion. He forgave the Americans for what they did to him.
Basim did not proceed to stereotype all Americans as violent and harsh.
This is completely wrong. Only a select group of people are committing these horrible crimes.
I assumed that Basim would angrier with America. what happened really he learned. it how to forgive the Americans who made this mistake.
If long story short, it is important to not make assumptions about a society based on the actions of a small set of people.
I agree with you that government should be separate from religion. I disagree with your point that using the bible as a daily guide of life can be harmful.
If i think and I was in preschool so I can't say I remember anything that happened.
I cannot fathom the heartbreak. the reality that this man has gone through.
Sam explains, we have trouble empathizing due to sole fact that these war zone.
Growing up the news was something I would hide from. My parents turned on the tv.
To this day I can find it to be scary. I am older. I believe it's important to know what's going on in the world.
I did not know. The exact reason for going into Iraq was for their oil.
disgusts me that America has this superiority complex where. we can take whatever, we want from others.
Who look back on history The Americans have always have been this way.
I did not know that they could freely leave their marriages though.
I live love. it breaks my heart to see two people spending their lives together. do not unconditionally love one another.
Everyone deserves a life partner through all the life's ups and downs thrown at us.
After all that has happened to him how does Bassim not loathe America?
Everything is destroyed. You lose your significant other, daughter and dog.
what really shows his character is the fact  that he realized he is not benefitting from his attitude.
He looked at his religion. Bassim forgave us
That quality right there reminds me of the Afghan people. who invite complete strangers into their homes to share a meal. they are under attack.
Once again Soc119 has brought another new topic to my attention.
Who said we were going to reverse the roles of white  In Which black people, I honestly did not know what to expect.
I understand he was trying to provoke an understanding in white people by explaining all the ways black people have been oppressed by putting ourselves in their shoes. I thought it could have gone a bit deeper.
In the activity the black people would respond to the white people with  comments such reverse discrimination is real, working harder will help you  accomplish anything, that all happened in the past, I don't know why you're upset about it.
I didn't do that, it all sounded ridiculous. I put myself in an oppressed, black persons' shoes.
Imagine if something like that happened in America. an Afghan plane accidentally dropped a bomb on the homes of innocent people.
Who hearing the story gave me Which a whole other perspective On life in Afghanistan
It is almost like we have been conditioned. America to think of war zones anytime we hear about Afghanistan.
I like how Sam compares the Sharia law to the Old Testament. It is very similar to that.
Even though it is a good basis on how we should live our lives in general, it did not have everything we as humans are going to face.
It is true we all interpret it differently
Most people believe that the whole Islam religion is violent. fight against people who are not part of them. laws which seems to be oppressive to us on the outside.
These are just a few of christian extremist groups we have that  we never say Christianity is a violent religion.
Book is subject to interpretation, which I have found reflects more heavily on the interpreter than the book its self.
This has caused tension towards the topic of Muslims in America. We never really take the time to consider how these terrorists are seen in the minds of other Muslims.
I have recently begun to wonder what it really means to be one.
I completely agree that old books should not determine today's laws. The old books are so ingrained in our society. I don't know how we would change this.
America was founded on Christian morals. We claim that it was areligious.
I agree with you that laws created from religious texts are now probably outdated. They have been in legal codes for very long. It is again probably extremely difficult to remove them.
of course the class isnt going to be entirely made up of Christians. the realization I think we all had was that almost every Christian  we know of does not follow those rulesmaybe the Willard Preacher does. the chances are very slim.
Extortion, sodomy, intoxicants, gambling, all of these things mean. it youd be turned away at the Gates of Heaven.
That statement is understood by the general public. Homosexuality is still hated by many.
Barna Group, an evangelical Christian polling group that has been tracking spiritual trends in the US for 30 years says only 17% of serious Christians.
The US did not make them wear certain clothes. The US did not take away privileges. The US did take away lives.
He knows the Iraq he knew  that has been taken away from him.
He has witnessed this shift to the horrible state Iraq is in right now.
This man had to watch his family get smothered out of his life.
If he now believes that Iraq will not return to the height he once knew
No matter what he has been through, he wants to be himself. He wants to be there for his son.
I do not know what Iraq was like before the war. It was much better than what it is now.
It is a lot easier said than done. The future is unpredictable. who knows what will happen?
If the Christian and Islamic (as well as other religions) are very similar in the fact that we all pray and live by the same standards of life.
US especially we tend to tie the Islamic religion to terrorism because we have seen and hear of stories of terrorists announcing their horrible acts in the name of Allah the God of the Islamic religion because these stories we tend to automatically assume that all Muslims who practice the Islamic religion are terrorist .
we see extremist in our own countries such as the members of the Westboro Baptist Church (in the United States) They proclaim that God hates Muslims, Gays and Jews we say the excuse that they are not real Christians they are just a bunch of extremists who dont really understand the Bible and Gods teachings.
Sam mentioned in this video. There are other Christian groups who are just as violent as the terrorists we see in the Middle East. We dont talk about them. They are not real Christians.
we take the time to learn about other religions we can actually  that find a lot more similarities with our own personal religion than differences.
It's crazy to me. People interpret the same exact words differently.
If my question though would be if Jesus himself reappeared and told these violent and hateful people that what they were doing was wrong and how many of them do we think would change their ways and become the peaceful people Jesus wants them to be?
I read the Kite Runner. It was a very good book.
It does not matter what country you are from. You have a life.
If i can be glamorous or retched but you have a life
So many are invested in their own lives. They look at other people. They reflect back on themselves.
you look at someone from another country. treat that view like a window not a mirror.
the article mentioned. a majority of women's rights were taken away. the Taliban came into power.
Taliban won't allow women to attend school or work. These are the stories the media covers.
Lastly, making a law system in the United States based on the Bible that  goes against the incentive that led people to move across the  Atlantic to come to America: to have religious freedom.
Even if it is done with good intentions or written in a sensitive and manner, developing a set of laws based on one specific sacred text.
We would be choosing one religion over another, which defeats that  our goal of creating a nation where all men women are treated equals.
This got many kids and parents worked up across the nation. It never bothered me. There were a number of Jewish people in my town. For a child, a party is a party!
These demands reverting back is ignoring the fact. the founding fathers distinctly did not want a repeat of England. it where only one religion could be right.
He brought up Basim Razzo. He was walking us through his life.
it took a complete turn. Sam said that the Americans had bombed his house.
And all I could feel was a sense of dread for this person that I had never even met.
If Sam continued to tell us that his wife and his daughter, his brother, and his nephew all died from this accidental bomb.
Sam read to us the message he received from Basim. The message was about how his light of his life was gone.
I dont think I could even begin to imagine anything. He went through.
He came up onto the screen through Skype. I was instantly taken aback.
wher However, hearing about Basims story actually forced me to think about what was actually going on in the world, realize that real people just like you me are going through life situations that are much worse than most of us can imagine
Sam introduced Basim to the entire class through Skype. You could actually hear the gasps and shock in the room.
For me, it just cemented the reality of what Sam was telling us.
However, those stereotypes are no different from the  Christians that we see preaching hate to everyone on the street.
The reality may be hard to swallow. Sometimes, It is important to know the truth. Hear someone else's side of the story.
Luke, you make some awesome points in your post. Your post shows the change in your thinking.
I was raised christian. I had the period of questioning what I was taught to believe.
If i agree with you that the Bible is able to be interpreted differently by individual people.
I agree with you that it was an eye opening experience. showed the thought process of people that thinks differently than me.
It's important to remember that there are extremists in both  religions who skew the view of what the teachings actually are.
The lecture focuses on the people who follow Muslim and Christian religions.
The KKK is quickly referred to as a hate group who identifies as Christians.
Its Christians claim that these people are actually followers of the religion claim.
There is a lot of distortion and misunderstandings about the Muslim religion that people are scared to confront . They have a conditioned fear of Muslims because of what the Muslims have been generalized as.
This lecture is titled "A Class on Empathy." I think it was a perfect fit for this lecture.
Its such a tragic thing what happened. The fact that he was able to forgive after that is inspiring to me.
If lot of us hold grudges on small things and we often forget that there are people out there losing their life treasures and cant do anything about it.
Life events that Basim has gone through, its amazing for him doesnt hate Americans.
I feel like many people are quick to jump to conclusions. We often forget that cities like Mosul have real people just like us.
It takes time to forgive. I mentioned this earlier. Both forgiveness and anger go a long way.
It would do no one any good for him to be angry about what the United States did.
I think that is something that. we Americans are not good at doing.
we were able to forgive the people responsible the attacks of 9 11   any other terrorist attacks we have suffered were able to separate the small portion of people actually responsible them from the larger portion of people that   were not involved in any way, we would probably have much better relations with people of other cultures.
Amazing how Sam shows us that we no different from other undeveloped countries.
He said that everyone should come together. make peace, not having fighting wars going on all the time.
Your home is destroyed. Your family is taken from you. It seems difficult to me to have happiness again.
Everyone makes mistakes in life. I feel blessed to have the life that I do.
Yes, we are trying to protect our country killing innocent people and destroying the lives of so many, is not the way to make our country any better
This shows the other countries that we are weak.
Quran and Bible are similar in the way that they can easily be interpreted based on the beliefs of the person read books.
Who agree, that are the Americans Who really making the best decisions for us?
Today, it is so hard to see the good behind the evil.
You have to ask yourself. What is it that I actually believe?
I understand what you are saying. The US is being selfish. The US is not thinking about what other people are going through.
I can not imagine a day where we are all in peace.
I believe that is an appropriate, I think if I was in Bassims shoes I would be numb for a very long time.
He said he was a couple months but I feel like I would be numb years.
Its agree with this due to the fact that staying angry for long is not a good thing and that is not a good way.
If I lost them due to a bombing, I would be so angry with the people who did it and Family means everything to me.
I feel like people make up their own interpretation the words to justify their own actions thinking that they are right
If we have to think twice of whether or not an act is a sin. We shouldn't have to go back to the books for it to be verified.
I always wondered why women wore hijabs. they ever feel uncomfortable wearing hijabs.
I also had a lot of questions and wondered what it was like.
The women also said that they felt empowered. They are walking around campus with their heads up and almost above others instead of being oppressed.
He talked about how he deals with it today. How it has impacted him as a person.
If i found it extremely humbling to find out how he did not hold a grudge against America for this and how strong Basim truly is as a person.
In general, people shouldnt be racist towards particular groups. they have experienced a bad encounter with someone of that race. they have experienced a bad encounter with someone of that religion They have just heard stories and stereotypes.
However, he is better than that even has American friends, like Sam
I sat in class listened to all of the horrible things that happened to Basim, it really put things into perspective me.
However, I never thought of what it would be like  that I didnt have them here to tell me important things.
It was interesting how this was the same question. it someone asked him the previous year he spoke.
Due to the fact that he is Muslim. HIs religion told him to forgive and guide him through his life.
Which something like this were to happen to me i know i would be angry at first
However, I agree with his response. learning to forgive is extremely important
You simply will never move on in life. You are at battle with yourself.
I believe that God would want me to see that there is still a purpose in life. I believe that God would want me to keep my head up.
This really hit me, the kindness forgiveness that  he shows in truly incredible
I agree that religion and politics shape our beliefs. It shapes nearly all the influences we are exposed to everyday whether it is your family, friends, or a personal experience.
Which In my personal opinion, I think those who follow the bible, Who is just simply a book, to essentially live  In which their lives is an interesting concept.
However, this is just another thing. I would love to learn more about. hear different peoples opinions on.
I wondered that same question. I was sitting in class listening to him. He described the destruction he has faced. He described the family members he has lost.
Basim does say he went through a period of a few months where he was angry. he raises a valid point that the anger would eat him from the inside. that his religion tells him to forgive.
He had a good experience meeting many Americans. befriending some to see the good in Americans.
I dont believe everyone would be able to forgive. easily they were in Basims shoes.
In that fact alone, was one of the main reasons  which I enrolled in this class.
We are so ingrained in our perspectives of the world. we can take time to understand another persons struggles and look through their lens.
I wonder if any people in class are having trouble seeing the points Sam tries to make. I personally experience many.
Never did I expect to see fancy buildings similar to what we have here in the United States.
These people deal with the direct impact of war on a daily basis. They still live normal lives in some aspect.
He is a father of children. He wants to provide the best possible life for them.
This happens all the time. We are self-indulged in the affairs of our own. We rarely leave the American bubble.
Which Something had to be done to retaliate but the fact that thousands some people millions of innocent lives were affected by our direct action is not right.
The idea that it mentions all the people. who would be excluded from going to Heaven. the long list this it is amazing.
Its idea that the people opposed to homosexuality but picked that out that passage and only specifically that one line sows how people show.
I completely agree. People fall in love with whoever they fall in love with.
There is no way in stopping that. The people who want to stop that should realize it.
It is hard to try to imagine all the hardships. the people in that country must endure with war right at their door step.
Hearing the perspective from both sides of the war was very helpful to surface things. I would have never thought about.
I agree with the fact. It is almost ironic. Many Americans scrutinize against and are afraid of Sharia Law. In fact Americans are just as sexist and controlling in the Christian faith.
As even sadder than seeing people died from natural and disaster because obviously innocent people.
Theres always a joke (or a truth) between Taiwanese people that China already have thousands of missiles aiming at us. they really want to take over Taiwan they can easily bomb us. destroy the island within minutes.
This video reminds me of the topic that we always joked around.
The first thing that come to  my mind is kind of selfish.
If i feel like they have already realized and the true meaning of life to a level that I can never reach in my life.
Most of the survivors look so peaceful. Most of the survivors taking about the disaster like nothing big happened.
The painful it will be to overcome the sorrow of losing love ones and a place you grew.
But shouldnt the government be representing the people in the country?
Politics might be a thing. I can never understand politics.
This was the most moving lecture I have seen yet. I feel very lucky that I was able to experience this connection.
Basim explained that his anger was hurting him more than it was helping him. he had to channel the energy to elsewhere.
He had many American friends. He was able to recognize the American people he knew, were good people.
Basim amazingly uses his Muslim religion faith to forgive the people. They committed the most evil of crimes against him and his people.
Basim uses his faith to guide his life. Basim transformed his anger into motivation to fight for peace. Basim transformed his anger into motivation to work with foreign affairs.
You also raise a good point. Most of the information we get from the news are statistics. Most of the information we get from the news are line graphs.
Personally, I did not love that class. I did think that it was hard to follow. The roles were reversed.
He is trying to say that you step into the shoes of other people see the world through other people you see the world in a different perspective
I agree that tolerance level is always going to be challenged long. we are open to it.
It has been eye opening to hear about other types of people. it in this amazing world that we live in.
The US entered Iraq looking for mass destruction weapons. While they were there they dismantled education.
The saddest thing I watched was how he lost his family.
Basim forgave the people. They destroyed majority of his family and his home.
I would never think that I was better than someone who was raised following a different religion.
A lot of people have the stereotype and Islamic people are radical, but Bassim is a real live example that this stereotype is wrong.
Sam said that Basim told him that even his dog  did not survive I felt sad.
He is not angry. he has learnt to forget, not forgetting all the people he loves. forgetting the hurts
In his life did not end in that bomb  that he has to carry on.
He does not have the hate towards other Americans. He wants more people to know. Many people in Iraq lives worse than him.
The American government has broken a system. It has to do something to fix it.
Its religion we believe, we are all expecting the same for ourselves families.
I mean is that the Arabic version at first glance that looks like a notably longer book at a glance.
With what I am about to say I am not trying to accuse Sam of anything. However the generalizations might not educate people well about a relatively important topic.
If Although it would be a bad idea to implement Sharia law fully with modern society and its important to realize that it was arguably appropriate for its time.
After this lecture I began to research ISIS and everything they have done.
I could never imagine something. it like that happening in the United States.
All women to wear veils, force all men grow beards, cut their pants then taking away the internet, cable etc its absolutely.
When ISIS came in what happened to Iraq's previous government?
Do we know what ISISs end plan is? Does ISIS plan on taking over more countries?
The United States had already changed Iraqi peoples lives. Before ISIS came into Iraq, as Bassim said.
I personally think that the United States has affected Iraq more than what ISIS has.
Its Sadly, Iraq seems like if it was not going and change nor improve.
This situation not only regards to Iraq but to many other countries and around the world that are being intervened by other countries.
They could receive advice. They are the ones that must decide where they want to stand in life along with their country.
They need help. They need other countries start listening to what Iraqi citizens are saying.
This is what has made Iraq what it is now. People want to stop it.
How could my country, a place where I luckily feel safe. it commit the horrible act of bombing an innocent mans home.
As miscalculation; however, this does not change the fact that Bassims wife, daughter, brother and dog were killed.
They were killed by the people of the place I call home.
I had never thought about devastating things that happen to innocent Afghans. They are at war with the US.
If i had only thought about the people committing these acts and sometimes foreigners that had encountered these terrorist groups.
I had heard it so many times that I began to believe it, I knew that life was different in the Middle East, but how different?
Bassims story made me realize. the lives of innocent citizens were far from different than my own.
I am informed I come across that brutal exchange of words I will use Bassim as an example and his heart wrenching words my light is no more
It is inspiring to hear him speak about his faith. It guides him though out his life to forgive others.
I told my family to watch this lecture. It impacted me in my life.
I just feel that the way he responds to this event in amazing.
I agree with what he said about anger.
Agree nor disagree with Abigail because we have been in Bassims situation understand problem then happen the people.
I really respect this man. I do not know him.
If I think that he is a great example, as I said before, but which many of us should follow in our lives regardless of the situation in which we might be involved in.
I found this interesting. Most professors at Penn state do not alter their lecture plans from semester to semester. Even if it would make sense if they did.
Violent group such as the KKK in America are rarely ever thought of being Christian because they are radial.
This could be the same for the radical terrorist. They identify as being Muslim
I am not saying that. As a Jewish person, I am offended by this. I don't give it a second though. I am just raising a point. religion is embedded in places that you may never think of.
I thought it was interesting. You said that religion is outdated. The world has received technology enhancement.
This was very beneficial for early societies. Now with the information overload these books leave a lot of room for misinterpretation.
The acts of terror that Americans view in the news are often strung back to a religious view at the core of it.
I do agree with you. Religion can be an okay guide or outline to society rules and values. it can lead to a lot of evil and hate.
Religious and race conflicts are so deeply rooted, and are very hard to fix.
I think that the idea of forgiving is difficult to actually carry through
The American government took away everything Bassim had.
Its smaller and lighter problems, but hearing Bassim say that he is able to forgive after this incident is very touch.
i think that he is wise to be able differentiate between the American Government Americans.
I respect that he does not group people together. The United States government grouped people together.
Some may think that Muslims are solely hostile. In reality, their religion teaches forgiveness.
If i believe that learning to forgive is a quality of a great person.
Which another topic that was interesting to me Who a comment that Which a student made after bassim spoke
This is a good thought. It makes me wonder about the tension between religions.
We humans become less sensitive to tragedy. it is away.
Overall, this was the most impactful lecture of SOC 119 for me so far. it gave me a new perspective to see from.
I was very surprised. Basim said he had forgiven Americans for killing so much of his family. I personally do not think I would be able to.
think at the heart of most religions is essentially just the message of being a good person
we divide religions up based on many different factors can almost all of them come back to core values of forgiveness, kindness, love.
Its world, you have to try extremely hard and look at multiple sources and events
That's what shocked me the most.
Which everything he's been through, Who I am amazed that he is strong enough to forgive.
It wasn't in the clip, I want to discuss  that something that was said in class.
I don't think anybody really hates this country. They want to have discussions. It is part of the history whether we like it or not.
I do agree that the United States is not the only country that has blood on its hands.
to really get past the issues we have in the United States, we must talk about it. it can be uncomfortable at times.
I was surprised how much information I learned by those interactions. Those questions were the ones that are afraid to be asked in normal interactions. It is not acceptable in societal norms. There is a fear of offending someone.
It shocks me. So many different European countries have banned the wearing of head dresses. There are 12.
France tried to ban the Burkini style. That was later lifted. Due to the ban being so confining and oppressing to women.
I noticed. they started putting the hijabs on the other girls. there was an instant connection over fashion. It is nice. because that is a universal topic that most girls faun over.
Basim made the choice to not live his life in fear despite his country. being consumed by war by both our government Isis.
Parents who learned from their parents about how great the US is and the opportunities.
This is how people grow up. They don't really know anything different.
If there are major wars or revolutions that I am just learning about now because our history classes were so focused on the USs history.
The thing that is amazing about this class . t it helps students to see issues from anothers perspective.
American girls to things that they were wondering instead of guessing or making assumptions incorrect.
The white and african american women were able to step into the muslim womens shoes (or hijab in this case) and see what that feels like first hand.
He is trying to accomplish in this lecture is a valuable comparison between the Islamic then Christian.
Ive havent heard much about the Islamic sharia  which I would consider myself a Christian, butI was open to learn more about it.
Shocked me the most was when Sam said speaking from a sociologist point of view, the Quran is very similar.
If i would have never guessed that because I would have never even guessed that and Jesus was mentioned in the Quran.
He gives a few real life examples: your neighbor's dog pooping on your lawn, drinking driving, driving fast, etc.
I think it is rally cool. Sam gives us the opportunity to learn first hand about many different cultures.
The thing that surprised me the most was when the white girls asking the questions tried on the hijabs. Not one of them had a negative reaction.
The Muslim women in our class. They freely choose to wear their hijab. They like it. They feel more comfortable on it. and they each have different reasons why they wear it.
I disagree on your statement that religion is an excuse to do inhuman things. You're referring to the minority of people in those groups.
Your main basis an argument is history which to some aspect: yes, the way they lived wouldn't be accepted today
I do agree with you that saying SOME passages in religious books are outdated. to say that all the morals. beliefs in the Bible Karan are outdated is completely misleading.
The best way to overcomesomething so tragic is to forgive. It is an extremely tough thing to do.
It was very interesting to get his perspective on the middle east. as Americans, the only perspective we have is our own
I cannot express enough his bravery that he can  openly share such a tragic experience in his life
You're going about your everyday day life.
Who think often about Bassim saying that his wife was just two feet away from him
This was the first moment where I found admiration in Bassim.
Something I found appalling was the dollar. The U.S. offered Bassim for his losses.
If he recognized that living his life in anger was only hurting himself and hindering any progress.
Think about anyone you've ever held a grudge against.
Bassim can forgive this unforgivable crime. We can can forgive others who have wronged us.
He made this lecture hilarious. He was also making a point.
Its parts of the Bible can get to be extreme and irrational but only if it was read and radicals.
The same thing applies to the Quran. It can be extreme. Parts can be taken out by extremists.
I like his point. It could be an extremely confining religion if the Bible was taken literally.
they Bible should be looked at as. it was the Constitution.
Both were written many years ago without much knowledge on precisely how  the future would be but set universal standards that should be followed.
It is not explicitly said what can/can't be done. It is still stealing. That commandment can be adapted to modern times.
I think that it takes a certain amount of humility. confidence to wear something everyday that outwardly expresses . the what you believe in.
I think that women live in a culture today. We feel pressured to look good all of the time.
Which we talk about America Who we really are talking about it from a historical standpoint.
Being closed minded is what causes issues.
You have to be willing to really listen to other people. you may disagree with what they're saying.
It bridges the gap between Christians and Muslims.
We speak so hatefully of Muslims for crimes that very very few of them commit.
If it is important to note that Sam isn't hating on either religion and he's simply drawing perspective and shedding light on the hypocrisy that we live amongst.
Its curious about hijabs and had so many questions about their reasoning person.
Who was surprised that in Which the girls were not allowed to shake hands with men.
In addition to the swimwear I was surprised about the community pools for females only. they could wear any type of swimsuit they pleased
I fully believe that our country has laws  that are reflected off of the bible.
Both religious books are a combination of stories explaining how we got to where we are. Both religious offer guidelines on where we go from here.
Sam brought up imagining. Use one book to determine every rule in your life.
I thought this was interesting. There are extremists, both Christian and Muslim, who do this.
We evolved when these books were written.
They are a wonderful spiritual guide. They need to be left as a guide not a rulebook.
Sam brings up things like drinking and driving stealing its interesting.
which we all know that legally which morally, these things are wrong.
which someone following this book to an exact interpretation how  do you handle that?
It is something very interesting. every person who reads the book, can interpret the stories differently.
Its liked the way Sam tied in other religions kind of to say religion.
Today we are so numb to hearing about all the horrible stuff going on in the world. We never really put much thought into the people that are actually affected.
I can't wrap my head around what Basim went through.
Two families were bombed. Multiple people were killed for absolutely no reason at all. No one even heard about it!
The way they celebrated this holiday was similar to the way in  which Christians celebrate a holiday like Easter.
Agree with you when you said that we as a whole fail to understand that no one religion is interpreted the same way by all people.
Start doing is opening the discussion on how we interpret things in our own way link.
We are actually learning about the what Islams believe. We are actually learning how similar it is to both Christianity and Judaism.
I agree that it takes an open clear mind to discuss these issues. it is such a touchy topic.
The more we talk about them, the easier it becomes.
Catholic, I never really questioned or deeply thought about my religious beliefs, because going to church every sunday and learning about Catholicism in school.
Sam has even done a Ted Talk. It was called, “A Radical Experiment in Empathy” It was about the importance of empathy.
I believe empathy is the most important thing. that we can emphasize today in society.
We are told treat others how you want to be treated from a young age. This mentality never hooks deep enough in us.
Learn about an issue. Having open dialogue about an issue can create empathy for people involved. It helps solve the issue.
someone lives in a different country than you, looks different than, worships a different religion, its easy to feel less them.
which Its our job to reject these feelings by educating ourselves about lives other people live which is what Sociology 119 does well.
I agree that every religion gives input to be a good person.
Religion values, whichever religion we talk about defines. it what people expect of themselves based on the beliefs common to the religions they practice.
which that week I realized I didnt want to be the person In whichwho didnt know anything about what was going on with the world outside of Philly.
It is up to us to do something with this lesson.
One way I plan to do that is joining that the Peace Corp graduation.
Its hand in Guatemala and they truly make a difference in peoples lives, all over the world.
Teachers have the opportunity to change that in our teachings.
Now it's up to us to do something about it.
He realized the anger would eventually destroy him he realized.
Basim taught me in a class period what it truly means to forgive.
Hardships in Iraq and Afghanistan are ones we Americans hardly understand.
We lack the empathy necessary to understand their ways of life. We act as if they are the ones who are wrong.
How are we supposed to develop empathy for people who have a completely different language, norms, and experiences?
Basim is an ordinary middle-class guy. He had his life turned upside down because of this war.
He cant really do much about a Muslim, is forced to move away from his home because it is dangerous
Its American I feel that there is just this sense of normality in life.
Our military can destroy people who didn't choose to be involved with the war and expect to fix it with a small amount.
Many Americans did not support going into Iraq in the first place. The decision was made despite this.
My mind that the average American isn't fully aware of the destruction the place.
Partially the media's fault because I feel that stories from people like Basim stories.
Americans don't know exactly how much damage we actually created. I doubt that they would support it as much.
But I do agree with your perspective.
All isnt God supposed  to be merciful loving?
I dont really understand a lot of whats in the Bible but I dont think all of what is written is set in stone
It is unfair to citizens who do not follow that religion.
America was founded on laws related to religious beliefs, creating a nation of freedom that is only acceptable sometimes legal under one religion
many historically famous documents quotes are related to religion, Christianity, God.
I grew up learning the ten commandants being told to follow them but you put it, it seems impossible to not break one.
I break the Christians ten commandments does not mean  I do not try follow them.
Sam invites friend Basim Razzo to talk about himself, a regular person from Iraq to talk about his experience and what he went through in the war.
Basim Razzo is a typical person. He came to America to study, got his degree, got married, and went home to Mosul.
He says his religion taught him to forgive. He uses religion to guide his life.
To speak with someone who has been through so much horror from my government was an experience I will carry with me for the rest of my life.
I admire his faith in his religion. He forgave those who wronged him.
Another countrys citizens at risk in an economic fight that have easily been resolved through diplomacy.
can I may not have any connection to Basim, but I do have a connection to the Iraq War
I remember the joy I felt when I heard she had come home.
It hurts me to see a story like Basims. I realize how devastating that war could have been for my family.
I truly feel for him. I hope something like this never happens again.
He was comfortable being Christian or atheist. It doesn't matter to him what religion he is defined by.
Anyone can claim that they are any religion. Are they really living a life that follows the rules of that religion?
For these reasons, people should not generalize all people of a certain religion.
Even so, he still was able to move on from what the American government did.
The way Basim forgave is truly inspiring. The way Basim was able to move on with his life is truly inspiring.
Why'd you have to take most of my family, but leave me to suffer
I think its easier to stay angry than try to move forward, but on  other hand, like you said, it will only fester inside of you eat you alive.
It prevents you from living your life to its fullest.
The words are not meant to be taken literally. We should use the morals of each story to guide our lives.
Life then making life choices is so complicated unique to every individual that a single book could never address.
Topics like divorce could never have a set list of rules right and what is wrong because there are so many possible.
the things that are stated can be interpreted. in many different ways.
I agree with everything you said!
Young ladies in Hijabs in the front of the class seem to radiate with confidence more than anyone person.
I honestly had no idea. I am glad they were able to share their lifestyle with the class.
However, I got older, I started having guys that I have had relationships with tell me to stop looking at them certain ways
can I think this class really tied into the points about empathy towards other races that Sam commented about in a previous lecture.
I like how you included your personal feelings. This was before and after class.
I can not bare going through the  same thing that he has went through.
I amount of strength this man has is something I have never seen before.
I honestly never thought this was possible.
The people to get mad at are the American government. He stated that in the video.
Another thing he said was, “his friend is helping him.”
After a while as well, you have to move on with your life
what happened can not be reversed  that should be one of the reasons you move on.
associate every Muslim with 9 11, but radical Muslim terrorists have made the image of a Muslim man woman something to hold prejudice against even you try not to think of them in that way
Making western white and black woman who dont wears Burkas ask questions made it even more prevalent to how we as Americans see the world.
Generation of Millennials starts grow up into adults we are changing the way we see people.
Panel directly post 9 11 it would have been very racist and very ill seen.
I agree. The media plays a huge role in the ignorance Americans have today.
So, thats why we have to uncover the truth ourselves of relying on stations like CNN to tell us what happening in the world
Thats why I try to keep up with whats  happening in the world.
I think that this clip should be viewed by all of America, personally.
However, meeting Basim via Skype, my entire perspective has changed
We brought negatives into areas like Basim's town. He doesn't hate us because of his faith.
I find this to be so beautiful in a sense.
They're often painted with a negative image but people like Basim totally change that
People in this country that could learn a lot about different cultures just by taking the time to have a conversation person.
More students at Penn State everywhere had the  opportunity to meet such wonderful people like him.
I agree it is something terrible that  needs to be expelled from society.
However, being able to do this is such a tall task. The type of people drawn to radicalism are lonely, lost, scared individuals looking for a place to belong.
Sams point of showing so many different religious groups, but explaining how they see themselves as Christians really hammered this point.
Our society tells us to get an idea as fast as possible.
In the United States, there are 892 active hate groups showing just how infinite the possibilities  could be worldwide to not only interpret one religion that skew any  religion in any way humans see fit.
I find your point about religion the government being combined in the Middle East very interesting surprising.
I don't believe that a religion has to define someone
I agree that holy books should really that only be used guidelines.
that doesn't mean  that I am any less a part of my religion.
Government to be based on religion can make controversial topics even worse dicision.
That's not saying Basim's family didn't mean anything to him. The fact that he was able to forgive after being wronged so badly is extremely noble.
Since 911 people in America have been scared of Muslims. Americans started to stereotype all Muslims as radical. The majority of Muslims are peaceful people like Basim.
Agree that everyone should pursue the religion they feel most connected with especially since that everyones right.
I know that forgiveness is something that is important in the Christian Bible. it is one of those things that is much easier said than done.
Imagine if all the people who themselves Christian Muslim could forgive like Bassim how different everything.
I always thought that I was accepting of all cultures. I realized that was easier said.
Sam invited the girls wearing Hijabs to the front to be interviewed however, I realized that I had never asked a Muslim these questions.
If I am so accepting how did I not know these things? I should at least ask someone.
But seeing those girls in front of the class, I realized just how open they were to the questions.
Sam tried to high five one of the girls they looked at him like crazy.
This was something I just never knew. I was so surprised.
Sam brought up the point that it is a special connection between man and woman. The woman saves herself only for you. I connected to that.
Sam talked about how there is no way for him to teach us all about others cultures and everything going on around the world, but he can instill a greater sense of empathy person.
Important to view others with an open mind and not judge them for their beliefs.
I come from an upper middle class suburban area. Spending time in the city of Oakland was quite the change.
School, it was very expected for people to graduate so I never really thought it was a big deal, but at this graduation kids were ecstatic to be graduating, dance.
Chinese who have learned about this part of history,which the nation hated Japan decades.
Hearing the accounts of others who had these experiences is eye opening.
How they made women wear veils, men having to cut their pant to a specific length above the ground not letting women drive, etc.
I respect their opinion on wearing the hijab. They have their reasons behind it.
When we were talking to Rafi, Im not going to lie, I thought that Sam brought him into class since he such a great person.
I thought he wanted to show us this one great Afghan. Rafi is such an impressive individual.
I do not regret following my faith. I am glad it has been a part of my life and upbringing. I do feel that people should have more of a say in their beliefs rather than parents guiding the whole thing.
I have learned some through this class. I really wish I can hear voices from all parties.
Islamaphobia is rampant in the media today. This video really showed me how some Christian groups are responsible for the same heinous acts.
Being Muslim Pakistani is difficult due to the  biased view that people have.
A lot of people are selfish in the way. They only are concerned with things that involve them.
I think that we should take Bassim's advice. We should try to educate ourselves.
I usually feel so lost when people talk about other world issues that are currently happening. I do not take the time to watch the news. I do not pay attention to other parts of the world.
I want to learn more about the war. I barely know anything about the war.
Having conversations with others that do know what is going on is   confusing frustrating me.
I think that they are just like anyone else. They just ended up getting a bad reputation.
I definitely agree with the argument you make in this  response to the lecture video clip.
Christian Sharia law is absolutely absurd. The video clip explains it simply cant be done effectively. A small book like the Bible just cannot cover everything needed to govern every aspect of every day life.
Basim is such an inspirational person. I admire him for his values. I admiire the way he has handled his situation.
He told us about his story. I had to hold back tears.
I have been so blind to all of the horror that goes on in the world. It was shocking to me to hear what had happened to him and his family.
He teaches me that life goes on. We must forgive. We must learn to be happy with the things we have.
To treat others with respect and love, and always forgive. I have been forgiven myself.
He is strong. he has shown everyone his strength.
I also like how he did not let this tragedy impact him for the rest of life.
I admire the fact that he did blame America as a whole for what the government did to his family.
he was here already was already exposed to the good side of America
I've always been away from religion since it is something that requires belief. Anytime someone's belief is challenge there is always a backfire or a fight. That grows from it.
What is happening to the Muslim community is the same thing.
humans wish to continue. further ourselves in this world. on this planet that we'll need to actually record what is happening. recollect the information that we've lost. so we can prevent ourselves from repeating it.
Sadly, humans as well all are have to much pride in what we believe. As long as we keep on believing we're right nothing will change. We'll kept repeating.
I've stated all I wish to state for this video response.
I guess I can add this at least. The world has been here for so long. We haven't progressed as much as we should have. 2000 years after whatever and we're still behind.
It is time that we stop generalizing all of these people. really look at their individual actions..
It is not fair to target an entire population when it was only a small group that committed the wrongdoing.
I do not know where he found it in him to forgive from such a horrible event  that changed his everyday life; but I understand am thankful of  how he did find it in him to forgive.
We can see that there is a problem that people use  the bible just to justify their actions
This whole objection of who is christian and who isn't.
The bible is giving events  which other people have witness.
people took the time to read the bible word for word 3 times over. they would still be confused, wouldn't have a solid answer in all honesty.
Like he said from his experience from living in England, they seem more aware of what  is going on in the world than the people of the United States.
Like Bassim spoke about, this would help us learn about the world, that understand that there is much more going on than solely what  is happening in the United States.
Also, unlike the U.S. media portrays it, people around the world live similar lives to us  in the U.S. have the same ambitions, a point that was made by Raffi.
This advice from Bassim was powerful and simple. It can be taken up by us in Soc119. It will bring positive change.
I have known and understood that innocent lives are loss. Reading those facts and statistics make everything so distant...unconnected.
Many people at times do not even support what our government does with it.
Along with the fact that he had lived here had friends here, in the states, who  he knew werent the evil those bombs projected us to be.
To put this into perspective I think about the 9 11 attacks, I did not lose anyone  personally, we all grew up with our country at war with the enemy.
They are just like us. People in their country are and have been making some evil. Terrible decisions in their lives.
I could never relate to what Basim is and has gone through. The idea of goodness and regular people in his country exist.
These are the two places that I care most about.
I feel that I would have a better and broader perspective on the world if I had care more about the other parts of the world.
To the best of my understanding, I believe that he is asking  us to be more caring about the people living outside the countries we know of.
These people live in countries that are considered war zone to the majority of population.
They are all human. They live like we do despite the slight difference between us.
The media is a fantastic tool. It can be considered as window to the world.
If we take the time and make good use of the media, we can know more about the other parts of the world. Be more understanding about what is happening around the planet.
Instead of allowing them to do this. We are interrupting their live, not really for the danger we feel. The resources we want.
That is crazy to think about. Could you imagine that a nation would bring war to your country? They could profit of your resources.
It was really cool to see the paradigm shift from this idea of an oppressive  culture into this the hijab being a sense of protection that allows you to be  which more confident in who you are.
It is absurd how we don't think of groups like the KKK being Christian. When we think of Isis all we think about is Islam.
In order to have more peace we need look at every angle. Before making executive actions that can ruin others lives.
You are moved by that is great. You are educating yourself is great.
They look at us the same way we look at them.
We talk about Muslim terrorists like ISIS. We associate them with the religion of Islam. We have to talk about the Ku Klux Klan. We need to associate them with Christianity.
They are the same radical people. They the same radical views. They are just directed towards a different group of people.
It is necessary for us to understand each other as humans. As people of different origins and backgrounds.
Professor Richards brings up the topic of trying to get us to look through the eyes of the Islamic people. Professor Richards brings up the topic of thinking how they must feel about the Christian religion
I agree with this part of lecture tremendously. I feel that most people dont understand that Americans tend to somewhat block out all the negatives that come from Christians. the United States is heavily populated with Christians.
they were to look at themselves through another lens, they would see that there is plenty of violence issues being raised by many other religions other than just those of Islamic descent.
Leading up to Basims skype call, we were introduced to him through a series of slideshows. The slideshows gave us a little background about his life.
I admire Basim. Basim goes on with his daily life.
I think it was so brave of him to be able to tell a class of 700 Americans what our country ultimately did to his family and life.
Basim calmly responded. He does not hate America for what they have done.
He knew the people he met here were not evil out to seek any harm against any other country
It is upsetting however, to think that many of us dont personally know an Afghanistan, or a Muslim, or an Islam, ect.
I think it is safe to assume that. far more of these cultures travel to the US.
This makes me think an even bigger divide in America and other countries. Are solely based on religion. Being as America is a predominately Christian counry.
It is obvious. Basims has religious beliefs in the situation. His beliefs helped him move passed hating us.
It is hard to put yourself in his shoes. if this happened to any American, I think we would struggle a lot to try and not hate that country. I know I would.
Basim was able to seek religion in a time of need to prevent his hatred  I think it is embarrassing that some Americans hate his country without  anything nearly personal happening to them.
Gabriella, I have taken away from Sam's lectures many of the same ideas that you have.
Since taking this class. I've realized that I know little to nothing about what goes on in other countries. Other parts of the world.
In the past class Sam brings up a good point. there is a lot of Islamic phobia and distortion of how we see things he tries to shape his lectures to show us students a different lens of perspective
I do think that it is necessary for this class to change. This class needs to evolve over time. World society is ever changing.
Only by absorbing implementing new elements from the latest trend can  we learn about race ethnicity issues around the world.
You mentioned about moments when Sam talks things that truly open up your mind.
As an international student, I do not feel as surprised. He shouts out to the American students in the class.
society is always adapting to new things. it is important that people do not always reference the bible to every little thing, decision that life brings.
Mostly everything that I hear about that is related to  this country is something very negative.
I guess I take my own life for granted.
He has a wife children  who he is responsible for.
They are no different than us except for the fact that they reside in a country. The country is constantly at war.
Rafi wants peace in the world. Rafi will do whatever he can to find that.
I want to help him find peace. One day I want his children to never have to worry.
A lot of people think Christianity and Islam are different. They are strikingly similar.
Shining the light on this hypocrisy was refreshing to see in class. I think a lot of students don't realize how unfair it is to only label Muslims as bad people. Christians commit some heinous crimes in the name of God.
I agree with you that church state must be separate,  that I wish to see this happen in my home country of Pakistan.
We should most definitely not allow ourselves to just assume these negative views on Sharia Law. It is what the general population does. Instead look deeper into what it promotes and the meaning behind it
I am a young American woman, but more than  that I am a jewish young woman.
Basims reaction to if he hated Americans, is similar to how I feel regarding the question, do I hate Germans.
It is very interesting to see how powerful religion can be. It helps a man who lost everything in his life still find happiness and peace in this world.
we have access to their personal blogs. We can know their stories. learn about systematic facts from geographical classes.
I am also impressed by the fact that he is willing to talk about this every year.
I agree when you talk about how a progressive nation became a backwards society. It's difficult to understand.
At a certain point in time. The Prophet (peace be upon him) came to learn that there would be an assassination attempt on those who did not believe in Islam. He and the fellow Muslims fled Makkah. Made their way to another city named Madinah.
I feel the Quran is a good guideline to life. you understand the context behind these lines in the book.
A lot of these lines do not apply in regular,  which day to day life.
Turning to religion meditation, I began to plan my revenge, envisioning the satisfaction ecstasy that would result from getting even through  violent retribution of the person who wronged me.
In my experience, this train of thought is not worth driving for long. I could not legally achieve what I wanted to do. I could not logistically achieve what I wanted to do.
It was very eye opening. When when it came to the misconceptions of people in Afghanistan.
Rafi's reality is not something I expected.
I knew people lived there, but not Rafi stood there talking did  that I fully comprehend that there were actual people out there who have nothing to do with the war.
We tend to view things from a close-minded perspective. We don't look at the whole story.
People tend to make generalizations. Classify all Muslims as violent killers. They associate this religion with violent actions.
Why cant those Muslims that commit crimes be seen as fraudulent.
We need easily accessible justifications. its really easy to say oh he just did that. hes Muslim all Muslims do that.
It is probably frustrating for those who are judged based off their religion.
Thats where the empathy part comes in  which we need to look at things from a different perspective.
Many people have been severely wronged. They lack the psychological wherewithal to only respond without violence.
My point is that, it's okay to hypothesize those ideal solutions. but we cannot forget/ ignore the other. ess ideal solutions many of us often turn to.
I thought that we might hear from Basim. Basim tied to convince us that life isn't all bad in Afghanistan. Many people live what we perceive to be normal lives.
I never expected the twist  that Sam dropped on us.
I couldnt imaging losing any of my family members even to  old age much less to a bomb from a foreign nation wanting my nations resources.
This talk really got me thinking about how war not only affects people  directly in the war zone, but even outside of it.
Growing up in a Christian church I was told many things about religion. I always remembered one thing. Following the Bible is the best way to live.
My parents have set the foundation early for me when it came to religion.
I heard growing up. There are many stories. Jesus and his men were on different joineries.
I choose to stop going. I started seeing things that my parents were talking about
Growing up following the Christian religion has been a good journey for me. I will always have faith in the lord.
The bible is just a cornerstone on how u should live your life. It has many different examples and stories that are interesting.
Jesus Christ, the son of God,. the Prophet Isa (peace be upon him) came with the Bible.
The Prophet Muhammed (may Allah honor him and grant him peace) came with the Quran. That is where another group split off. That group is called the Muslims.
there are parts of Sharia that refer to harsh punishments and other areas that seem very radical. Most Muslims who use Sharia law as a template to go about their lives believe in the more moderate version. It is against unjust harsh treatment of others.
we have people in our own government. people in our own government crying out Sharia law. it is a threat to our democracy. the slightest bit of understanding about what it is.
From a fundamental aspect, both the Bible and Quran are very similar. Both emphasize on treating others the way you want to be treated. Forgiving others, not killing, etc.
They also both contain violence. We do not hear about the violent side of Christianity nearly as much.
There are many extremists who have carried out attacks in the name of their respective Gods. Muslims get scrutinized the most. Muslims are who we hear the most about on the news.
You just never know what type of person is in the room.
If more people went out and experienced different countries. They might have different opinions on those people.
One thing Americans tend not to do is  travel outside of the country.
We are introduced to Basim Razzo who is a man who  has lived through horrible misfortune.
Somehow Basim goes on. Someway Basim is not filled with hate.
The fact that he could get on a Skype call and talk to 700 american students that are from the country that changed his life for the worse is amazing and admirable.
Our country did something terrible to him. He still shows us compassion and kindness from across the world.
Islam is a very peaceful religion. These violent acts are of those who are in the minority. They call themselves Muslim.
we could all learn a little from how Basim approaches his grief   learn from his compassion it would make great strides our country.
We killed. destroyed his life.
I was surprised to see. Women in Afghanistan have so many rights.
I don't think that it should matter where in the world you live.
I strongly believe one of those rights is to be able to get out of a relationship where you are being treated poorly.
I feel like me personally I am catching myself checking  up on the validity of news reporters.
It is another aspect that makes it difficult for us to be like come on, that's a joke. We're on the other side of the world.
if this were happening in the US we could easily discount this. not being exposed to lifestyles in Afghanistan and the middle east It really at all makes it so easy for us to fall into this trap of hanging off the media's every last word.
I felt Richards was trying to get us to view issues from a different perspective.
I enjoyed this segment of the class. open-mindedness is very important to me.
We can't continue to make these blinded assumptions. We should not speak on things that we know nothing about.
I think this is true regardless of where the violence happens.
When a muslim or someone of another religion commits a crime, they are automatically labelled a terrorist.
Newspaper articles have shied away from this label. Newspaper articles say he had extreme values.
I enjoyed reading your post. I agree with everything you pointed out.
To me its not really a choice of when to wear it . If you are going to practice that religion you should take it seriously.
The hijab is a symbol for Muslim women to cover their body form men who are not their husband.
Everybody is entitled to practice any religion they want to. It's just up to them to keep their faith strong.
I also thought this was a super interesting topic in class.
You really really love your religion? Why not live your life by its rules?
I wholeheartedly agree with everything you mentioned in your post.
It must be difficult when good-natured Muslims are being disparaged when someone from ISIS carries out a terrorist attack.
This statement made me think how big this problem has escalated  just the fact that nations are competing to own this natural resource.
If Iraq did not have this natural resource, the U.S. wouldn't be in this country. Most of the wars could have been avoided.
Sam received a facebook message from him. U.S, soldiers had bombed his house. He lost most of his family.
We had a Skype call with him later. He mentioned how he saw no hope for Iraq becoming what it used to be before.
A similar tragedy happened in Panama in 1989. The United States invaded Panama to take own the Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega
This type of tragedies is what makes me think how short and harsh life is.
By taking time to educate classes like Soc 119 . Basim is able to take a terrible thing that happened to him. Make a difference with today's youth. Who will hopefully magnify the change.
How in one second you could lose everything you love and stand for. That is why I think we should be thankful everyday for the life we have. I am from Panama. In 1989, we suffered a U.S. invasion.
I know that this advice really constructive. I am almost completely oblivious to our own government. I am complete oblivious to the rest of the world.
That is very detrimental to people who want to learn about what is going one that  get skewed information are misleaded into thinking a certain thing  without being about to form an opinion on their own.
I will be sure to see what is truly happening  not getting brainwashed by the media.
People will take the same exact reading interpret it in multiple different ways, that some people kill others over it, some people abstain from certain activities, that some people eat certain things, etc.
I think it boils down to the person. they choose to translate. what they're reading.
I think that a lot of issues and events happening in the world between different countries and religions. Stem down to the individual person committing these crimes. Participating in these events.
I thought about this during my group meeting too. It's how I view the whole Black Lives Matter issues. It's how I view the police brutality issues.
it makes me question. how can people participate in some of these things but swear against others?
some people use some of these things. a guideline to murder others.
Another thing that is important to understand is the fact  that the world is constantly changing, evolving.
One thing I agree on is the fact that we need to take a closer  look into other religions, races.
Being a white female, I have grown up to be accustomed  to the norms of my specific religion.
The idea that only Islamic groups have caused terrorism is not right.
We are taught specifically that only people from certain places can cause such harm.
I like learning about the world from a different perspective.
I think everybody was wondering the same thing Stacey asked. I am sure Basim had responded to the question several times before.
The reason this is what caught my attention left me thinking ,reflecting.
He actually had good experiences with Americans in the past. Why should he hate them?
That is something his religion taught him encouraged him to do  that forgive, just like in my religion (Christianity).
I agree. There are a lot more similarities between the religions. We may not realize this.
I also want to emphasize. We take the chance to learn about them.
When he was explaining what had happened to him and his family, I put myself in his position. All I could imagine was the intense burning anger I would feel.
I would not necessarily hate the United States. A big part of the blame would be on them.
People tend to lump both Arabs and Muslims into one category. In reality, being Muslim is a religious belief. Arabs are people that come from the Middle East.
I was glad that I got to hear Basim speak about his lifestyle. The way that he goes through his life every day.
He lives a regular life. Consisting of work and taking care of his family. Like many Americans.
It is important to understand. We can not marginalize and create stereotypes of groups of people. We must first trying to learn and understand how they live their life.
Our religious are more similar than we thought.
If we all realized that, there may not be as many wars.
It is horrible that different cultures see each other in different ways because of their beliefs.
I feel that I had a book with stories that establish my laws  that I would not follow them.
In America, people who did not lose anything personally in 911. Use their religion and religious differences to hate others.
I am angry with America. I have so much to learn from Bassim.
How do you forgive people who seem to hate you?
It is hard to hate someone you truly know
The more you get to know someone the more which you build empathy understanding.
Hate comes from not knowing another person.
He was able to connect with this man. He started to relinquish his hate.
With these stories in mind. It is imperative that each and every one of us continue to push ourselves to meet people from all over the world. With all different backgrounds. Connecting person to person is the best way to dispel hate and build empathy.
To truly forgive this country, one must understand the suffering and struggles of those who turn to this hate.
Picciolini said he sees people in these hate groups as broken people with underlying problems, struggles, and suffering. This led them to a life of hate.
But if we do not try to do so, we are no better than the hate groups themselves. We are hating others without connecting with them as people.
With this empathy, we must build relationships that change minds who support those who can like Picciolinis organization Life Hate.
The country we believe that our past few presidents are drastically that different from each other represent vastly different ideas.
Basam has said that about many administrations. promised to help with issues that his community faces.
Each administration has not followed through on these promises.
This may not be a well known fact to many Americans. What we hear about our presidencies is very much focused on ourselves.
Following through on our promises, we could possibly help a war zone become a community that fosters education Following through on our promises, we could possibly help a war zone become a community that fosters hope.
It may also help to create a new worldly perspective on the impact of politics.
I didn't realize the damage that not only ISIS was creating. Also the damage created by the United States.
I also never knew about all the changes that ISIS brought upon parts of the middle east.
This leads me to believe that there is hope. I'm sure Basim knows better than me.
A question I had was in relation to headdresses.
Basim said that ISIS made women wear them. Why do women continue to wear them? If they are no longer being controlled by ISIS?
For example, if a Muslim woman is in the US why would she wear the headdress.
Before ISIS, not all women wore it. Why wear it? It was mostly an idea coming from a radical perspective.
I think that we tend to put racial groups (people) in a box. It makes it easier to judge people without even knowing them.
He understands. It is not the people's fault. What happened to him was a result of a very minute group of people.
Here in the United States after the events that took place on September 11. The poplulations persceptions of people from the Middle East shifted into negative, hateful thoughts.
Nobody sought to understand that what happened that day. A result of a very small portion of people. That the whole country does not share the same mindset and values.
I like the controversial topics that we talk about. How we do not have to be politically correct. It makes it so much easier to talk about these issues. See the different points of views of people in a more open way.
I think that some issues I really have been able to empathize with people that couldnt have before because I hadnt thought about the ideas that Sam brings up.
Everyone has their own right to interpret the bible in their own way. They do not have the right to be ignorant of how those interpretations hurt our society.
I think that now more than ever society needs to see that religious teachings need to be modernized.
By modernizing it, we may be able to eliminate some of the hate that  is directed towards people who do not fit into the mold of what the bible says a person should be.
Not everyone takes the teachings of the bible and overtly does hateful things. Their beliefs could be teaching the next generation. That people that are different are wrong.
I always thought that people in hijabs would be shyer or less confident. To my surprise, it is the total opposite accordingto the girls we met).
We do not change our beliefs. It is always good to understand someone else's. See where they are coming from.
People are very judemental. Instead of focusiong on how all our religions are different. We need to look at how they are similar. Use them to accept people. and not judge them.
In Chinese international student in America, I always found it interesting that despite the fact that we enjoy technology in our daily life, most of us are  not aware of what is happening around the world.
The big data analyze everything about us feed us the things  that we might be interested in.
What if we in fact are not exposed under new information at all?
It was my first time to meet talk to someone from Iraq,  suffered from great loss, managed to survive the tragedy.
It was beyond my imagination that he can truly forgive the ones who  have taken everything from him.
I realize that it was his religion that gives him the power to forgive. The power to move on.
He believes. There is a written ending for everyone. There is a written ending for his daughter, wife, and brother.
Every war has a reason. , most of them relate to interest, like power, money, resources.
However, speaking to a real person, who lost almost everything in this chaos, that  was both mind-blowing heat-shaking.
Many years ago, his wife daughter were killed in a  miscalculated bombing by the American military.
I were in his position, the sadness pain that I would have felt  would have transferred into a deep anger America.
The rage that would have been built inside me would have caused me to want to take extreme measures against the US to get them back.
However, Bassim, as he stated and showed through his calmness in a Skype chat, is no longer angry at America.
His mindset was one that I decided to share with my parents.
She experienced moments where she would be thrown out of her home which  have all her familys belongings taken from her.
This is a hatred. It has never escaped her.
She explains to me that I had only experienced what she has  which I would feel the same way.
I have absolutely no idea. What must she have gone through?
All I have are stories.
However, in hearing from Bassim  that I decided to give it one more shot.
Though they maintain their level of dislike towards many groups of people, I am confident that they are beginning to realize that the hate they feel is only tearing away at their own souls.
It was designed. Religion would not influence it.
I want my government to be based around factual information on the healthiest decisions for people. The smartest diplomatic relations. Opposed to what the bible says to do.
Not hate the country that ruins your entire life.
His religion tells him to forgive. He always uses his religion as a life guide.
The Japanese government never admits the massacre. The Japanese government even tries to obliterate the history.
This is basically the reason why the relationship between China and Japan is always very intense.
I would never forget the history.
Basim told us the story about his house being destroyed by the United States. They offered him $1,500. I felt embarrassed to be an American at that moment
We took this man's entire life. turned it upside down. we said here were sorry. how does an insignificant amount of money sound.
I understand that there are accidents in the military. When it comes to dropping bombs from hundreds of feet in the air. We never stop and analyze the effects it has on civilians on the opposite side.
There would not be world peace. There would definitely be a decrease in the number of war-related deaths.
I thought to myself. he sees no difference in how the presidents conduct business. they are not the ones making the daily decisions.
I led myself to another dead end but then Basim made another comment.
all he saw of the world were the shadows  of the townspeople that crossed it.
He went back to his friends in the prison to explain what he saw. They could not understand. They have always been living in darkness.
This relates to us today. All we know of the world is what we experience in our environment.
We can only assume what the world is like based on our society.
With that comes the risk of a twisted perception of the outside world. inability to acquire a full understanding of what the world is like.
professor Richards gave us an example. how twisted our reality is of Muslim countries.
The only way in which we can truly discover what reality is. Understand a culture is by getting out of the darkness. Experiencing reality ourselves.
I realized that he was only one of many that are  affected by these unfortunate circumstances.
The only reason why I did not see. how much of a big deal this was in the past. was I have been living in the darkness.
I believe it takes a very open minded person to realize that if he were to continue to be angry, he would only hurt himself more.
Having Basim come speak in our class was something I will never forget. Listening to him talk made me feel so many different emotions.
The event that happened to Basim was a heartbreaking, devastating tragedy. It is inspiring how he can still have such a hopeful outlook on the future.
I knew that the Quran was used as a guide to law. I did not think much about it other than that.
As a Catholic, I understand what Sam is saying . When he talks about interpretation of the Quran or the Bible.
With true equality. our government. law would value other religions. what the majority thinks is the superior.
After the battle, around eight hundred thousand of citizens have currently fled their homes. A result of fighting in Mosul. Some of them decided to go back to their country. They want to contribute. serve for the country.
He told us that he was in the house with them at the time of the bombing. He was standing only two feet away from his wife. His life was spared.
He told us about how he lived in the US eight years he became friends with many Americans. Americans were all good people. he said that the problem is with the US government.
I have never detached myself as a citizen of the United States. I thought about how from outsiders. they may think that what is happening here is very similar to what is happening in places being controlled by radical believers of different religions
It was Bassim's religion that helps him which to withdraw from sorrow, move on.
But this is the first time to realize that the power of religion, faith.
Nearly every person in the world has acted in some way against the Bible.
As Sam Richards said, even soliciting is against the Bible.
I can almost guarantee that the people that claim to be acting in Gods  wishes have gone against the Bible one way another.
For all we know, God could have meant to make soliciting the worst sin in human history.
In this video we started class talking about the effect and reasoning behind the United States intervention in the Middle East after 9 11.
We said that the reason us going into Iraq was that we were worried  that they had weapons of mass destruction.
One such person was discussed in class. Connected with the class via Skype call.
He lived in Mosul with his family and lived a happy life.
Once the conflict reached this part of Iraq it started to take the toll that war takes on all areas.
Basim was also badly injured in the strike. Basim needed months of recovery.
This is just one story of many in this continued conflict  that has reshaped a whole country.
After about 8 years, Basim and his wife moved back to Iraq where they started their family.
We learned that. Basim had a daughter,a son.
This did not make any sort of news. Things like this have become normalized in a country. The country is a war zone.
A house and material things can of course be replaced. Basim can never replace the loved ones. He lost so violently.
I personally had been asking  him this in my head.
I face adversity. It is not to the degree of Basim's trauma. I will remember a middle-eastern man with old fashioned glasses. He spoke brilliantly about how to push on. life feels like it is over.
I agree. You describe Basim as a role model. I have never encountered someone who has gone through so much. He was able to live life without hatred and anger.
I think it is so easy to take the bad that life gives you and turn it into pain or hatred. The way Basim was able to turn it into forgiveness and find purpose in his life.
I also agree that a major part of his ability to mve forward was his son. I think it is really beautiful how much love he has for his son. After all the tragedy the two of them faced.
Americans were to travel out of their comfort zone. educate themselves more on worldly issues, we would not be nave. only think about what is happening in the United States. we would expand our knowledge.
We are happy to live life in the bliss of ignorance. knowing multiple cultures can lead to greater success.
we should recognize the people of other countries, and recognize their worth and abilities. There would be a better connection between a lot of people.
I remember being scared of Afghanistan people and treating them differently. In my mind they were very different from me.
Now I know Afghan people are not that different from me. Sam has brought people. Everyone speaks to us about the Afghan people.
You should definitely reach out to other countries. You should definitely try to understand them. You should not be ignorant to what is happening outside of your own country.
I like how mentioned that the hate they feel is tearing away their souls. you can't forgive on the inside it will eat you alive. I learned a lot from watching that video. well reading about your personal story.
However, I do not think that religion should play a role in our government.
The separation of church and state was created so that no ruling body had a religion backing it. This would lead to the same problems that caused people to go to America to escape religious persecution.
We do not really hear the perspective of someone in the middle east. We don't hear the perspective of a person who had family killed because of the war.
I think having Basim tell his story was something that needed to be done. This is because as Sam said. A mistake was made with the coordinates of the air strike. This mistake lead to a deadly result.
not did Basim say that he hates the American people,  that there is a stigma that goes around where Americans think all Middle Eastern's want to harm them but that is clearly not true.
The man who had lost his loved ones due to an American airstrike says he does not  hate the American people, I am sure there are many more like that out in the world too.
Like is it just a human nature thing to have the drive to find a way to  move on even a person has lost much?
It leads me to question if people of any faith background. Would have a bit stronger resolve to forgive. Move on from terrible tragedy. Than a person who doesnt really have faith in any religion.
Its scary to think about how everything you care about can just go up in a flash like that.
Many Americans have solid perspectives on the world. shaped to the taste of the media that the United States chooses.
The idea that you can be completely unbiased towards something. has been highly flagged in American culture is hilarious.
That's the worst lie anyone can ever tell.
The importance of being brutally honest so others may relate with you on ignorance and to stand up is key to further progressing as a nation.
The weird thing about this lecture is that people attempted to be so cool with each other. Even though they know their views have completely diverse points.
I also thought it was interesting that Basim said that his religion tells him to forgive others.
He does have a problem with the United States government. Basim understands that not all people living in the United States are a reflection of their leaders.
It was scary seeing such a normal persons life change. For no reason other than because he was an Iraqi.
I agree with you. everything can change in just one day. We need to live everyday like it is our last.
I have never thought of  the U.S. involvement in that way.
I wonder what other factors would have contributed to our troops being in Iraq in addition to oil.
Sam explained. people interoperate the Bible in all different ways. is true.
Another point Sam made. Sam was arguing about the bible.
Some people believe they can do certain things, act a certain way. of how they interrupt the bible.
The bible is commonly interrupted in so many ways.
The picture shown in class with the woman holding signs negatively referring to our soldiers.
To her, the bible made her think that all soldiers should go to hell.
At the end of the day. you cant change the way someone believe. in something.
I think its important for everyone to understand the ideas Sam was speaking about.
Basim speaking was inspiring Basim's speaking was needed Many people are unaware of what happens outside of this country
I think that Americans need to hear more stories like this. We truly do not grasp the horrors that go on from this war.
Basim's story has to be one of many. someone had lost their family. everything due to the bombing. raids that happen on their home front..
I could not believe that the US could do that to innocent families. Although, what the US did was an accident.
This war has completely destroyed the whole city. The construction of the whole will take much longer than we expected. Due to lack of resources.
we are built off. It should be the main motivation of leaving.
I agree with the point you made about not being able to follow every single rule the Bible writes out for us.
I think this class and video. Opened up the idea that all religions are equally different. Much as they are the same.
The option is there. Some Christians fight. Bring god back into the classrooms.
Sams friend who came in to speak to us really touched me. He expressed how much he loved his wife and family.
Men in the middle east are usually portrayed by the US to be uncaring and not loving to their wives. It was eye opening for me to here this man say he would never divorce his wife. It is because of their deep love
growing up I used to be angry with people all the time. I realized the same thing happened at Basim.
I was in 10th grade. there was a kid named Austin. I got into a fight with him.
While I thought it was worth it to hold a grudge. Basim realized that you must live with what happened. All the anger that we hold inside will practically destroy ourselves.
After days and days of being mad when I saw Austin, I started to think of I should not let the fight that happened cause this much pain to me.
The anger I held against him was much worse than the physically damage done in the fight.
I now try to keep this in mind any time I get upset with anyone. It will all end up the same way.
From my American perspective I do believe that ever since 9 11 the United States has been very critical of anything associated with Islam.
I find it funny that you say that Americans do not find Sharia Law to be a good thing simply because it is a word that is associated with Islam.
I find it interesting that you see faults in Sam's lecture.
I feel that Sam gets an A for effort. He tried to explain such a complex issue in such a small amount of time.
Being a Muslim in the US, I noticed this from a young age. If theres any act of violence the attention given to the perpetrators religion increases significantly if they are Muslim compared to if theyre Christian.
If the perpetrator is Christian they tend to focus on other reasons. Why they did what they did. If they're Muslim they tend focus way more on the entire Islamic religion.
I remember talking to my friend this week about the hijabi lecture we had. I thought it was amazing. She started asking me questions about it.
She is less likely to be one of those people that believes everything being said about Muslims in the news. She now knows a little bit more about the religion She knows a little bit more about the customs.
The video that I will be responding to is introducing Basim Razzo.
Sam kind of pushes it aside. It was not one of the main reasons.
We saw everything that happened. They were all destroyed.
I would have been unbelievably mad at the US. I would have been mad at anyone that lives in the US for taking away everything important to me.
Bosims story really shows all of the senseless killing that occurs in war.
Even with his son still being alive. I dont know if Id be able to keep going. For fear of losing him too.
He said that at first he was completely numb. he became angry.
He said that the anger ate at his heart. He grew tired of being angry over things he couldn't control.
I thought his response was very human. He said it was all he could do.
People whose children died by the hands of men. miles away that they have never met.
There are thousands of people rightfully upset. more thousands of people who have let go of their anger towards America.
People just like Bossom. they had no choice. they continued living their lives.
How much consideration are these people given when the US government is making important decisions?
When congress decided toinvade Iraq to look for weapons of mass destruction. There was questionable evidence of. Did they consider that their actions would destabilize the regions for decades to come. Resulting in the deaths of thousands of people?
Take for instance divorce. Sam discusses he says how it continuously says that this is how someone should divorce. It is not the case.
It doesn't even have to deal with divorce. people just try to interpret the Bible in a way. it seems somewhat controlling of others lives.
Sam says it is subject to interpretation. some that use the Bible or those that use the Quran try to use it to create a society that they believe is the correct way to live.
I was expecting a very angry, hurt person.
That was the most beautiful surprise ever. he was the total opposite.
The way he answered the first question was one of  the most powerful answers I have ever heard.
The way he has come to forgiveness let's love guide his life is  something only an extraordinary person could do.
I try to think the way Bassam does in my own life.
People recognize this things could have  turned out differently Bassam.
I have so much respect for his strength, I hope in the future we can have more Bassam's in the world.
In your political views, I think it would be almost impossible  that to find someone you know who really likes all three.
Maybe if everyone could come as relatively close to experience the perspective of Basim as we did, things would be different.
I feel like this can be applied to the tensions mounting with North Korea.
Our president is willing to end the world over  some petty insults.
People think that Muslims run their country with their religion, I don't think people  ever think about how some of those high up in American government try  run our country based on their religion, which is most likely any of those under Christianity (mainly Christian faith).
people try to create laws to stop abortion. they believe it is murder.
I learned many things. about women who wear them. I find to have so much new found respect for them too.
I never knew that they take. only when they are indoors with other women.
I also admire the respect they have for themselves especially around men.
This has been the lecture  that impacted me the most.
I was thinking about the companies I wanted to talk  to other things related to securing to an internship.
I was paying attention to Dr. Richards lecture, which I was very anxiously sitting there.
I was in absolute shock. I felt bad listening to the story.
Immediately I noticed that both screens went black. I thought some technical issue occurred with the projector. Mr. Bassim appeared live on our projector.
Mr. Bassim was skyping the class. One of the students asked him why he doesn't hate the US.
I was so touched about how calm and forgiving Mr. Bassim is.
This lecture has not only shown me the unjust in this world. It put me into a lot of self-reflection.
Most of my life I always thought of it as being a very oppressive thing. Meant to put down woemn. Perhaps it really isn't that.
You could argue that women over there do not want to drive themselves at all. That seems to be a pretty large generalization.
Im sure the truth lies somewhere in the middle. For now it is certainly hard to see.
I think it is very easy for us in America to be caught up in our own country. Forget about all the other people there is in the world.
I heard about a country like Basim's I had never thought there could be many similarities between me and the people who live there.
With that mindset I was missing out. I wasn't learning about some really great people.
Secondly, I thought this video really spoke to me. It is advice that I need to take myself.
sitting in on lectures reading various news articles from class, my mind point of view changed about how I other should be more invested in what is going on in the world.
other things happen in other countries that are far more important. to be considered real news, it takes us way longer to hear about, react about it.
I would like to take Bossims advice. apply it to my own life.
Sam started talking about Iraq, Mosul. I had no prior knowledge to the situation he was about to explain.
Now the city looks different. The United States has broke the system.
The educational system, societal system, and cities have been broken by the United States. I never knew about it.
This information was presented to me. I'm sorry about all of the individuals involved in the chaos in Mosul.
He was a colleague of Sam's  that lived in Mosul.
He had done some of his school in the United States. His family lived in Mosul.
His family had a very nice house. did his brother. his family.
I was curious as to how Basim could cope with his everyday life. He must have been knowing that another country took his loved ones away.
I come from a catholic family. I went to catholic schools. I never took the bible seriously enough. catholic schools could be compared to sharia law.
Sam shows us that different people have different interpretations on the bible.
a key takeaway. most westerners find sharia law to be crazy.
For many years doing things that were frowned upon by religion. Would be considered a crime and consequences would be paid for such attitudes.
The things is that today many of those things  that were frowned upon are not anymore.
talking about this thing. my grandmother. completely different.
He showed forgiveness even to those who  doesnt deserve it.
I deeply agree with him. Being in such a globalized modern society I feel like we dont take advantage of the opportunities we have of learning from other cultures. We dont take advantage of the experiences of people different than us.
Knowledge is not something we only learn in books. its not only measured by grades.
That is why I am deeply engaged on Sam Richards class  which I feel like he gives us knowledge that goes beyond the textbooks.
Being able to hold a conversation with girls who wear a Burka. For them to eliminate any type of stigma we had about why they use it. Was so eye-opening and interesting.
Most other Penn State classes are the same thing year to year. The classes lack the same level of engagement that soc 119 has.
I am replying to Sam's monologue about empathy. if we say the kkk and other radical christian groups are not Christians, then how can we say the radical Muslims are Muslim?
I completely agree with everything he's saying. You can not generalize a whole religious group based on the actions of a small minority.
You can't say all college kids are alcoholics. Some of us like to drink on the weekends.
You must show them. really make them understand how foreign people are no different than us.
Speaking with Basim Razzo  that the entire room was captivated.
He is from the middle east and a part of a religion that so many Americans have an irrational fear for. Everyone was able to feel his pain through his story.
Many American students here at Penn State, including myself, have never gone outside our comfort zone. Many have never really pondered what it is like to be in a country that is not the United States of America.
Regarding foreign policy, specifically war. I believe that our efforts in Iraq are proactive towards creating a peaceful and stable nation. Perhaps more importantly at the same time protecting our best interests.
there is room. use of different tactics can be used. I believe that the United States leaders are doing the best they can in a hostile, foreign government.
Sometimes, we tend to get so caught up in our own world. Thinking that having three exams in one week is the end of the world.
Even at the living conditions. They seem unthinkable to the rest of the world. they aim to thrive in their lives.
On top of this I always thought that people within  the same social class married one another.
I thought this from the movies I have watched. Also, from articles I have read in the past.
The viewpoint of marriage in this area is most likely misconstrued to the general public. Most people probably have the same thought process as we did.
Marriage is a bid eal. When you're forced to marry someone that you don't want to be with for the rest of your life, you will most likely not be happy at all.
I know that the different presidents have had various effects  on the status of war in the United States.
Basim Razzo expressed his opinion on the different presidents effects on his home. It was eye opening.
My own ignorance lead me to think. I thought into all that I do not know.
I thought about everything I believed. my liberal status.
Growing up I was raised in a very liberal family. being liberal lead me to share such beliefs, like many kids.
I agreed with everything that they believed.
I have these beliefs. Now I am able to formulate my own opinions, and research them. I can have a better understanding of the topics.
I was relatively ignorant. I was ignorant to what I do not agree with.
I always assumed Obama would be trying to make that region safer. I was wrong.
This applies to Americans who love to see all of the positives in the country never point out the negatives, but judge other countries for what theyre doing.
We must be more willing to discuss the problems happening within the country. They can be fixed. We can all recognize that we have a lot in common with many other countries in the world.
I think a way we could combat this. trying to expose more people to different cultures. showing how we really are all very similar.
Once you put people in the same room and make them have a discussion. It becomes very easy for them to see their similarities.
Compassion and kindness should not be something that is limited to a certain group, a certain community, or a certain religion. they should be unconditional with no buts or limits
I really like how you related this class lecture. You are learning about in your other class
Like you stated about your prior knowledge the same went for me. I am not very religious. I at least thought I knew certain things about the various religions. I seemed to be wrong.
Learning about the Sharia Law really made me think about how we tend to view things in negative ways. In reality they are really close to our beliefs.
this was a very interesting class. I'm a muslim woman who occasionally wears the hijab. I like sparking up this conversation.
Senegal is a very religiously free country. Senegal is 92% Muslim. Senegal's president is a Catholic. it has never been an issue.
Our government sometimes isn't majority Muslim. It never posed an issue to be discussed.
she came here. she faced backlash. I have never seen it before.
I mean you have men in the US using religion to justify taking multiple wives,  which I mean come on, thats just gross.
I never had any type of prejudice against Muslim women who wear Burks. I must confess I never understood it.
We are from Brazil, a country who embraces showing off your skin. we actually share the same belief in a way that we consider our body a temple that belongs to us. we shouldn't be afraid of showing it
America has been the predatory force in wars abroad in the Middle East. With American military personal, unrest in the region has been constant.
I think Basim is aware of this, knows the best thing he can do is portray his culture  in a positive light to break the stereotypes that are being forced onto the American people.
Terrorism is a very difficult thing to deal with. Condemning an entire cultural group is extremely detrimental to progress.
I believe that a lot of our ethnic issues in America stem from a lack of empathy. we just teach our future generations to put themselves in others shoes.
During that time in life I did not really understand religion. I knew that I was Catholic.
When I was around 10 years old I stopped going to church. Started saying I was spiritual. Rther than religious.
I believe that there is some type of greater being force. I would not necessarily say it is God.
During high school I learned about Buddhism. Thought that that was the religion I wanted to follow.
I experimented with being a Pagan. That was not successful either.
It is very evident throughout history the lengths to which this country will go to gain access to resources abroad.
He needs money to rebuild his life.
I don't even know. I would be able to feel at that point.
Such a thing is unimaginable to me. I've known safety all my life.
There are many in war stricken countries. This is their reality.
Basim overnight lost basically everything he ever cared about. He is able to have such a positive outlook on life.
He went on to explain that, he happened to survive that night. it is obvious to him that god wants him on this earth, has a plan concerning him.
Basim is truly an inspirational figure. I just wish Basims story was spread around more. Others could learn about this amazing man.
I'm not sure how easily I would forgive someone. That someone ruined my favorite shoes. People have forgiven the country that practically destroyed theirs.
I also agree that the term America bashing is so silly.
We arent bashing. bringing those issues to light. we are making the country better.
We also have to start holding leaders responsible for their roles in the continuance of all this destruction. when are we going to say enough is enough?
People work so hard to essentially cover up the atrocities committed by the Christian religion.
I never even considered the possibility of not being able to get a divorce if I wanted to. Many men live with that unfortunate reality in Afghanistan.
I was curious. he didn't seem angry.
Basim was presenting himself so calmly. I truly couldn't understand why.
Many Americans have really negative beliefs on the Islam. Many Americans think it's a destructive religion. They relate it to many radical groups.
Basim's house was bombed by the US government. He did not build prejudice about American people. Americans should be able to get rid of their prejudice about people practicing Islam.
Its really good for you. collect information from different people.
The news is sometimes not objective. I'm often the one that looks at the newspaper. I tend to believe them. This is the fastest way to know what is happening around the world.
Sometimes it might challenge me about something Ive always thought it was real as well.
I loved your point that we have the ability to help. people are dealing with real issues on a daily basis.
Overall, I agree with many of the different points you have made.
Basim showed how courageous he is. Despite the loss, he moved on. Despite the heartache, he moved on.
Basim does not generalize us. Why are we generalizing him?
We can all learn. His policy of forgiveness.
He says his religion teaches him to forgive. We should not look at this as a religion-based quality.
You are Christian, Muslim, Atheist, or anything in between. Forgiveness should be something we all practice.
It was inspiring to see how it picked himself up, rebuilt his life. I used his story to educate others.
everyone could forgive like Basim did. Maybe the world would be moving in a slightly better direction.
Bassmins responses to all the students. That had asked him questions. Amazed me.
Sam had him give our class advice. Bassmin did not want to consider it advice. He just wanted us to actually do what he says.
He used an example that soldiers have not heard of Iraq before. That to me was astonishing.
I agree with Bassmin. We should start personal work. Find things out on our own. Rather than depending on brainwashing social media.
It was extremely eye opening. Listen to what he thinks. Students should start doing.
Bassim taught us all avery valuable lesson. That is forgiveness.
The comments you made about how you get mad at your parents and how you get angry over little things that arent that major, I completely feel you on that one.
I have so many dilemmas every week here at school. I think the dilemmas are the end of the world. They are going to ruin my life. It's really nothing compared to the big scheme of things going on in the world.
I cannot believe that man. hey have to repeat talaq three times.
This is extremely simple. A woman has to go through the process of going through the court for a divorce.
This week I chose the video Bassim's Advice to the Class. It really resonated with me.
He continues to live life looking for justice, but not angry.
I thought that Afghanistan was a region inside of Iraq.
I am so ignorant of every other part in the world. I don't think it's all my fault.
I think the US overall has some sort of mentality. We shouldn't worry about places. It involves us.
I saw something after the hurricanes that really struck me.
The kids were holding up a sign. The sign read Praying for Texas or something along those lines.
These kids have absolutely NOTHING. These kids went out of their way to show theycare. These kids are praying for our country. Our country had a devastating catastrophe.
Thank you Haley. sharing your connection to the Iraq War.
The truth is you're right. Our country just wanted oil. Now for that reason people like Basim are suffering for it.
I believe it will allow us to do more research on the cultures of other countries. we won't generalize cultures that may lead to prejudice.
Not just the class. He has evolved with it.
It definitely feels really good. not a lot of people are aware about what's happening in the world they live in and are surrounded by.
We as people should learn to believe and accept the kinds of people, religions and issues that come up. do our best to help or support it in every possible way we can.
I was not brought up religious. Everything you're saying is new interesting information to me.
However, I do know. Many religious books are extremely contradictory. You interpret what was written.
I respect Basim so much. He wanted to know what happened to his family.
On top of that he basically teaches almost 800 people about compassion. It puts so much of our issues in perspective.
So many of the problems in my life are so little compared to his. Even imagining the things that happened to him happening to me makes me want to cry.
He could have stayed angry at the US. it would have been justified. He decided that he wasn't angry. That fact is the most impressive thing to me.
Many Christians are stuck on the fact that homosexuality is wrong. They turn a blind eye to sins they are making.
Knowing this makes me question how many people can continue being judgmental of other peoples actions. They do not even take the time to evaluate their own actions.
Judging people in and of itself can be considered a sin. Many people do not seem to care. They are so busy judging other peoples sins
People who act this way are actually almost being hypocritical. They are accusing other people of committing these horrible sins. They are committing sins of their own at the same time.
I agree with you. I did not have any prior knowledge about this. I pretty much had the same ideas as you about this.
His life was pretty much destoyed. His family comprised his life.
It was surprising to see how he dealt with this situation. He was even able to forgive the people behind this.
I felt myself becoming angry. Being in his position.
As Bassim states in the video. It was a complete change of life. For everone in Iraq.
My heart really sunk. When Bassim admitted at the end of the video. He is not optimistic for the future. He is not hopeful for the youth of Iraq.
I believe this is why Bassim wants to eventually go back to Mosul some day.
Sam promised the week before. this was the best class of the semester. That is a lot to say. most classes of SOC119 have been enlightening experiences.
For us, the foreigners, it was supporting evidence. It was an explanation to what we perceive
Some powerful reflections arose from the debate. It was more subdued than it could have been.
The Blacks own the system. The Blacks works on their behalf.
The programs instituted to level things out. Are making no noticeable difference.
I searched for statistics on demographic distribution for undergrad students in University Park campus discriminated by race ethnicity. The most recent I found was for Fall 2016.
The fact that we were all there to hear is crucial. making a more noticeable difference.
After many years doing this Sam no longer has the sense of urgency these statistics generate in me. I feel compelled to dwell on them longer. I feel compelled to spend time making sure everyone saw comprehended it.
I would love to hear Sam speak of what he perceives is the impact of these lectures. he sees a tangible outcome from his talks translated into the University Park community.
We can't make an immediate different in those numbers. We can get better at wearing each other's shoes. We can translate this lecture into a lesson on empathy.
I, too, could not fully understand why he was not angry at the United States at first. Once he explained it, I could relate.
Having cultural differences is okay. I do believe that there are many similarities that all humans share.
I think Bassim gave us a lot to think about. I'm so happy I was able to experience it!
The disputing may never end. We are the only ones who can stop it.
It is no surprise. America has its share of unwanted events. America's events will never compare to those countries being destroyed by war.
It is very heart breaking. That these horrible things are occurring. Because of the lack of ownership. To our own resources.
There has to be a better way. To gain these resources.
I feel like there is a lot being covered up. It makes this place look good. In reality it is just building itself of the destruction of others.
I think it is important that we call attention to the lack of sympathy being shown to those affected.
You can say that has happened here. Just as much as we are hurting, other countries are too. At the end of the day we are all the same.
It's no surprise how powerful America can be. Instead of using this power to kill. Why aren't we using this power to unite. Make the world a better place for everyone.
Forgiving is a hard thing. For some people to do. Depending on the situation.
Bassim said you only have one life.
I will not forget the way he explained forgiveness. I will always keep it in my mind when I need to forgive.
What I found sad was how much the people have suffered. They have be unable to fend off for themselves. They are put in between both the American and ISIS.
They just want to live normal lives. Are put in a position. They no matter what are being held. At gunpoint by both sides.
Every time that ISIS strikes. A lot of innocent people are killed.
t was a sad conversation with Bossim to talk about. His family was killed by the people that are trying to help the situation.
In my opinion this would definitely end with more civilians dying. It is more than either side that is actually fighting in the war.
It has been infected by war an, violence. truly feel sorry. the civilians of Iraq.
These horrific wars caused the deaths of many innocent people. It is only in this course. I feel like I am truly gaining knowledge from both sides
I particularly like the pictures that showed Mosul.
From the images of the University. the shopping mall. to Basims middle class home. these pictures provided me. with an insight about regular life in Iraq, making their destruction that much more real.
Prior to this class, I never thought about shopping malls in countries like Iraq, Afghanistan. Their existence is important. It helps us experience empathy towards those we often feel share nothing in common with us.
I particularly liked when you mentioned the part about how Christians do not see the KKK as Christians. They contradict some of the most important teachings of the Bible.
Muslims that engage in extremist views are the same as the KKK. Muslims don't see them as Muslims. They break their religious code.
I found this part very interesting. I never thought of making that connection that people like ISIS are the Muslims version of the KKK.
Forgiveness is a virtue that many religions teach to be very important. I am not sure many people would have reacted in the way Bassim did regardless of their religion.
I think it is a virtue. everyone should take more seriously. the world would be a better place. people treated each other the way Bassim has. and still does.
Life moves on even if you do not. You might as well move on.
, Trumps statement is not factual. a lot of the Dreamers are contributing to the economy. a lot of the Dreamers are serving in the army.
handful of them commit crimes. all of them need to suffer the consequences.
Trump has recounted times where he sexually assaulted women. he has not faced the consequence of his actions. he wants DACA individuals to pay for the actions of their parents.
I think one of the hardest things that Bassim had to do in a time like this was to be able to realize that life keeps going on. If he kept this anger inside of him, it would eventually consume him.
I have so much respect for Bassim. The courage that he has shown. Since that devastating day in his life.
We live in a world where violence and tragedy is prevalent. It isn't only because of one group of people.
I really agree with the stuff you mention here. I agree about the lecture changing my perspective.
I also never really knew how similar their lives were to ours.
When Sam went on to tell us about the bombing I was very taken back.
This lecture really made me sympathize with the people of Iraq. I know what they are going through.
I also thought that Bossom's attitude towards the American Government was extremely puzzling.
I tried to put myself in his shoes. He's an Afghany man who's whole immediate family, brother and home were all murdered by a bomb sent by the US Government.
Sitting there unable to comprehend it. I could not imagine a situation where my anger would cease to exist.
Sam was relating questions students. It was really cool to me.
The empathy towards other races, religions, and other groups. Should be and needs to be the foremost thought. Of us as humans.
Not shown in the video. He had some girls from class try on hijabs.
It does not make the individual person any different.
They are just practicing what they believe in. They have every right to do so.
I hope we can get to a point where people a whole do not feel uncomfortable. someone chooses to wear a piece of fabric around their head.
Basim is very intelligent. He realized that hate ate him from the inside.
it is indignant to see that the United States government does not take any action to improve Syrias battle. the United States government does not do anything to bring peace to this country.
I think it's hard to understand. Why the government always tends. To be a trouble maker.
The Japanese Fascists killed three hundred thousand ordinary Chinese people. Who did not have any arms. To defend themselves.
I dont know both Japan government, U.S government would be responsible. what they did to Chinese people and Syrian people.
It's sad to see how that can just be said. People must just take it for what it is.
it's not anytime soon. When will it be?
By this I mean but that people will blame and an entire religion or race for a problem situation that occurs
People committed this attack. They did not represent the religion they followed as a whole. We spread the blame around evenly.
I have a few Muslims in my family. Very close with the one who is my age.
Hi Brya. I found this lecture to be extremely eye opening I found this lecture to be heartwarming.
We really don't hear about it at all. If Americans knew about stuff like that. I feel like people would be more empathetic.
The sad thing is this has probably happened. To so many innocent civilians. We are unaware of it.
I agree it is very heartbreaking. We can just go into someone else's country to destroy lives like that.
I get that we are trying to help people by protecting them. We are also hurting them.
a student who attends college in the United States. I have been aware of the war going on overseas. the vast majority of people never hear incidents like Bassims that occur everyday to innocent people.
ISIS is another contributing factor. Who broke and dismantled. The military and education systems. Along with many innocent indivudiausl homes.
I agree that what happened to Bossims family was unfair. I could not imagine the type of pain that he lives with every day.
In many ways though, the United States needs to be in Iraq though. The reason is due to ISIS.
I agree that it is unfair that the U.S trying to put dominance over the people. we can spread our influence is wrong.
However, it is not like ISIS only strikes in Iraq.
One example would be when an ISIS member went to London. The ISIS member drove a truck into hundreds of people.
the situation in Iraq is such a mess. the innocent civilians have to cooperate with both ISIS and the Americans in order to just survive.
What I loved the most about this video. His response to this question.
I admire this man. That was all he went through.
I dont think that no one deserves to go through this. That he wont be able to see his wife and daughter again breaks my heart.
We can stop those events from happening. Accept each other as one community.
You raise a good point. You say there is a lot being covered up when it comes to war. We never hear about the mistakes America has made.
we may never be able to really put ourselves in the shoes of others, it helps to have the kind of communication that we had with Basim. These are serious discussions on how transnational government intervention is really affecting the lives of innocent citizens who dont have a say in the matter.
If that was me. I would be filled with a lot of anger, hate.
I would probably blame the situation on the United States. They were the ones who negatively affected his family.
My family is my everything so if anyone took them away from me I would be filled enormous amounts of hate.
He said something I thought was awesome. He said his religion teaches him to forgive. Forgive is what he did.
I thought that it was also cool. That hw still has friends that are American. Lived in the United States for eight years.
I do not know if I could ever forgive as easily as he does. I still think that is awesome that he can.
We are all the same inside. why are we focused. differentiating each other.
I and about everyone else in the room. Seemed to feel a similar distaste. When hearing what happened.
I feel that this is where our stigma towards places like Mosul come from here in the states.
The fact that people of a specific faith. Try to interpret the words of ancient text. Generalize them to an entire population. In my opinion, wrong.
Sam states it leads to arguments within the religion. It's about what should and should not happen.
The bible is a holy text that should not be used for selfish purposes. That is how someone interprets the meaning of divorce in the bible.
It is not my place to do so.
To a lot of Americans, all Muslims seem to be part of this group. They think that Islam is an evil religion. That's simply not the case.
This sparked a lot of conversation. We all could agree. The war probably seems much more real for the people in the Middle East.
Much like you, I never really saw it that way. After hearing how your friend described it, I was very intrigued by this idea.
I truly believe the United States has come a long way with respect to sexism. I agree we still have a ways to go.
Ahmad is the perfect example of a real person in Afghanistan. He is simply living his life in a place that happens to have conflict.
I was surprised. Saddened to learn how many civilians. Were killed. As a result of this fighting.
Its not that what Sam talks about isnt true. t proving what is said is true isnt the focus of the class, having empathy is.
The class isnt about just getting informed. Its about living your life outside of class. To constantly be a learner of social issues, To not be a preacher of your own beliefs.
The reason that grades dont matter. much in Soc.
What goes on outside of class is in many ways more important than the classwork. How you carry yourself on a day to day basis is what being a good student is really about.
The movies don't show the parts of Afghanistan that you mentioned.
The giant malls with designer stores are something that I identify with American lifestyle.
The story Rafi showed how people who decided to stand up to the extremism in the Middle East were killed.
I believe the war on terrorism is hard. Terrorists blend into communities that fear them enough to remain quiet.
To lose your family, is an unimaginably horrible thing to have happen. Though I would pray to be able to give forgiveness, like he does, I see it being incredibly difficult to do so.
Him saying this really puts things in perspective. Most people tend to generalize the actions of few, to the people as a whole.
People are guilty, including Americans. Americans tend to view all Muslims and Middle Easterners as bad due to the actions of a few bad people. He has learned not to be angry at us. He knows there is a separation of power between all Americans and those responsible for his family's death.
USA has the longest standing democracy. I know about. That is a privilege.
The lecture that stood out to me this week was the one when we online video chatted with Basim Razzo.
We went on an online video chat with Basim. A few students were able to ask him questions.
One question was asked. I was also very curious about it. How is he not filled with anger at the United States.
I think that Basims response to this question. Really showed what is it like. To truly forgive someone.
He came to the conclusion. it was only going to hurt him. he continued to remain angry.
Coming from a high school. With incredible diversity. In the student population. I was fortunate enough. to see the world differently.
I had many friends who were Muslim, East Asian, African American, Indian.
I am truly grateful I am able to see the world through a different lens.
For Basim and the rest of the innocent people in Iraq during this time. You cannot help but feel sad for what they had to go through. Especially being innocent.
the media in the United States does did not portray. the lives of the Iraqi people, they were good developing people like us.
That is something that Americans have typically never had to experience besides 9/11. We lost millions. We haven't had a true war with other countries on our soil.
I thought this to be a very good question.
America could not justify what they had done to him.
He was a completely innocent bystander. He had his entire world flipped upside down.
If this was me. I do not know if I could forgive America.
He felt numb. He was unable to comprehend what had just occurred.
He gave two reasons. conquering anger.
He had many friends from the United States. Who were great, nice people.
He had no reason to be angry at the people.
His other reason for conquering anger was his Islamic religion.
he religion of Islam says to forgive. he did.
I like to think that Basim would come to terms with America. Sam has seen the ways of many regular American people, whose own views do not represent that of those who hurt him so.
Bassim says that he uses religion the guide him through his life. he is a proud Muslim.
here have been many classes where I have really thought about things that I have never considered. thoughts dissipate shortly
I am fortunate enough to say that I have not experienced a life-changing event like Bassim has. his demeanor and mindset is admirable and inspirational.
He said he sat down. He had a meal with Americans who were very respectful. this made him realize that Americans are not bad people.
Americans, I feel that a majority of us view the people of Iran  To be terrible people who have a great deal of disrespect America.
Talking with Bassim. Was the first time I got a first-hand experience with a person from Iran. It has inspired me tremendously.
Whereas those people have nothing to lose. That is why they do not mind sharing.
Even though a majority of the white population today is not racist. There is still a small amount that is. Racial prejucide is surprisingly still a part of our country.
People should not be at a disadvantage for getting a job. People should not be at a disadvantage because of their skin color.
people were to really try to connect with one another. understand what each person goes through. the world would see a lot less conflict.
Throughout my life. never really been exposed to Indian people.
At Penn State though, I have had multiple interactions with Indian people. It has definitely been an influential part of my life.
I never had any negative thoughts or connotations associated with Indian people. I didn't really have any great associations either.
I have found that a lot of the Indian people I have met are huge basketball fans.
This is the point I guess I am trying to make. Without connecting with different people, it is going to be impossible to change your mind about people. A whole race of people.
The world needs more opportunities to have open discussions. Meet people you may not associate with in the first place.
Not everyone has to travel the world to help those in it. There are several ways to give a helping hand. I believe that all people of the United States, myself included. make more of an effort to make the world a better place, any way that we can.
As I grow up, I want to take what I have learned from Bassim. I want to pass his story and inspiration on to others.
His daughter Toka will never grow up.
She would be about my age. If she had lived.
why am I here
But it means that each day I get to spend on this earth is a gift.
I am not a religious person. I believe that God has a plan for Basim.
A man who say that God has blessed him. After everything that he has gone through. Is a holy man in my eyes.
Sometimes their curiosity is for them to get a clearer image towards a specific topic. Sometimes their curiosity is to broaden their knowledge about Islam.
The Sunnah is usually used by Muslims. It is a pathway for a successful life filled with blessings.
They used the so-called sharia. they misinterpreted. the Quran and the Sunnah. excuse to kill in the name of God.
In sharia, it is completely forbidden to murder anyone whatsoever. a person who commits the sin of murder it is equal to the killing an entire humanity.
Taliban forced all women to wear the veil. Taliban forced all women to cover their faces It was completely forbidden.
We had the skype call with Bassim. He made it clear that he is not mad at any American. The American government was the reason he lost various family members.
It could have easily been America. I cannot possibly relate to anything like that happening. I've never experienced this here.
I have about four people in my family who are active in the military.
Its easy to be desensitized to something that does not affect you.
the takeaway lesson from this class was to put yourself in someone else's shoes. someone who has experienced an awful tragedy like war.
As citizens of a country where its a luxury to not experience living in a warzone. It's our obligation to empathize with those. Who live in fear every day.
Islam is truly a peaceful religion that has been given an awful image by the very few people that actually do commit acts of terror. People that actually do commit acts of terror disgrace the name of Islam.
Bassim is an inspiration to me. In the sense that he is able to move on. The disturbing events he has lived through.
He is completely calm throughout the pain he has endured.
I feel like we were impacted by this segment of class very similarly Maxwell. Many of your points correspond to the thoughts and feelings I have had and am currently having.
We were able to talk with Bassim and understand how he perceives America. It has had such a large impact on many of us.
It is important to follow up. we are not persuaded to believe one way versus the other.
I live in a place where we are all created equally. That is not the case for others. Who reside in different parts of the world.
I think that it is extremely hard to understand. another countrys so'ciety truly is without immersing ourselves within it.
we do not all have the opportunity to immerse ourselves within a society in Islam. being given the opportunity to talk to people like Basim helps to bridge this gap of misunderstanding.
This lecture. one of my favorite lectures. we have had so far. a class.
I also really liked when the girls who don't wear hijabs tried wearing one.
It also must st be pretty nice. To not have to worry. About what your hair looks like.
I am a guy. This is something. I am always worried about.
Stacys question was one that I wanted to ask. I figured that a lot of people did as well
I personally tried to put myself in his shoes. I had a very hard time doing that.
When the camera, swung to the girl in the audience wiping tears off her face, I was the same way.
Of course he was angry in the beginning. I think that any other person would be.
Finally, he mentioned about his religion. guide him to forgiveness, I was speechless.
To hear him say that he was not angry at any American. Something that will stick with me. For a long time.
He genuinely is one of the strongest men I have ever come in contact with. I feel so lucky to have been given the opportunity. I hear his story. I listen to him speak.
it is important to think. This is what Sam really was saying in this lecture.
There are just too many buts or ifs in the world to regulate with Ten Commandments.
From what they have inferred, they must do everything their lord commands. they will spend an eternity in hell.
a man can say to his wife I want to divorce you three times. it is done.
He came back home from the college he got accepted. He now sits at home working a job. Hopefully he is going back to school in the Spring.
It also sucks for most of my friends. They are going through with their parents getting divorced. They have to go back and forth to their mother and fathers house every week.
I would like to be able to talk to someone from Afghanistan. who is a cild of divorced parents ,see what their day to day lives are like.
Basim has been through things. I cannot even imagine.
His reason behind it is even more powerful I think.
You mentioned that he realized that he had the anger. the anger he had was destroying himself eternally.
We find ourselves caught up in these grudges. That can have a huge impact on our lives.
they are affecting the people who they are held upon.
It is crazy. hear from someone experiencing everything that you see on the news.
almost hard to grasp. how different my life in the states are.
There are tragedies that happen everywhere. I live in a mostly safe area. dont think about the terrors that can happen. terrors that people are living in as in depth.
Hearing a story like this really puts life into perspective. It shows you that the world is a crazy place.
the US wasnt intentionally trying to be the bad guys. ended up taking on the role.
I think religion is somewhat individual.
I found it to be disturbing. Sam showed us all of the murders that were said to be bible driven.
You can not agree with someone. You can agree to disagree. You can tolerate one another.
The world would be a much better place. everyone found a way to remain open minded things that they might not believe right off the bat.
I think that it is unfortunate how much conflict is brought upon in this world. The different ideals , beliefs that people hold.
That's a word. very few people truly live by.
Granted, this is due to our social intelligence.
I am learning. this is a dangerous instinct that can encourage islamophobia.
We have to admit our wrongdoings and prejudice.
Hearing other peoples story. the adversities they have endured. being able to understand. relate to their pain. no small thing.
It is the key to changing our way of thinking about every person we encounter.
What this class has taught me. Is that people are not so different.
A person may live in another country. A person may have a different religion. They are more similar to me than I realize.
But if all three qualities are in both parties, I believe peace can be reached.
I think. the first feeling would hit me. It is sadness followed by fury.
I do not believe constant anger would solve anything.
He had this eye opening moment. The problem was the way the goverenment runs.
This was the moment . He realized that there is no use in being angry. It does not make everything go back to normal.
Religion can definitely be there for a person. Religion can guide them through times of hardship.
For some people, when they think of Islam, they think of terrorism.
It stems back to the way people interpret a religion. in American media, the Islamic faith is rarely portrayed peaceful.
It makes me wonder why we always generalize an entire group or idea. a few incidents caused by radicals?
He did not want to give us advise. He invited us to be more aware of the the world.
World history was the only compulsory history course in high school. It was packed into a single year.
Honestly, this course was refreshing. Even though it was only about European history, it was still a break from the same 250 years.
The EU is a governing body. It impacts all the member nations like the UK.
America is far more self-sustaining. the international dynamic America has with the rest of the world is come to our shores.
I do not hold Americans solely responsible. They have an isolationist attitude.
I think that is awesome.
I have been to so many classes in my life. The teacher dryly reads from a textbook every single class. Throughout the majority of those classes I have learned nothing.
It comes to the point where each day the professor reads directly from the book. I just memorize the multiple choice answers to get a good grade when test time comes around.
In his class he constantly tries to teach his students about things that matter.
Sam does constant research and studies of race and humans. He understands that there is still so much for him to learn.
This is the way a lot of classes should be taught. Teachers should learn themselves. Teachers should try their hardest to explain things to their students through their experiences and knowledge.
Not some textbook. they copy and paste into a PowerPoint.
I chose this video. This particular day in class stuck with me. It stuck with me more than any other day.
On this day, our sociology class met Basim Razzo. Basim is a man whose home and brother's home were destroyed by Americans.
What struck me much. this class was the fact that we actually had the chance to speak with Basim over skype.
I was shocked when he appeared on the screen. At first I was confused why he would even want to talk to us Americans.
After all, the American government was responsible. The terrible things that had happened to him. The fact he was willing to talk with Americans. Amazed me.
The man had lost everything. he wanted to speak with us students.
everything that had happened to him. Basim said himself he was no longer angry.
Basim said that staying angry about what happened was never going to solve any problems. That is why he chooses to continue moving forward.
I know that personally if something like that happened in my life I would have a very difficult time forgiving. I would be angry for a very long time.
This class was one of my favorites. Everything Sam brought up I found interesting.
Yes because of the subject matter itself. introspectively as I started to think about why I never think about it or separate it out from the issues happening in the world.
Prior to this class. Nobody seemed to focus on the fact that interpretation is a key factor in the way religion is made into law.
applying Sharia to the religion Im most familiar with. Christianity, made it clear that this is an interpretation thing. religion has key lessons to be learned. is in itself a guide instructing its followers on how to live a prosperous , beneficial life, but not everyone will apply that guideline to the present in the same way.
These areas of overlap. Are where we see difference in Sharia. Where I saw the nuances of using religion as law. I simply had not been thinking about prior.
I really like your comment. It is really interesting to compare your culture to Muslim culture.
I think that to say a burqa is sexist is akin to slut-shaming. you are telling a woman that she cannot not make decisions about her own body.
I found this lecture to be very interesting. we were able to actually listen to someones personal side. he war in Iraq has affected their lives..
In the United States, we are taught throughout our early years in school. the history of many countries. their current state of living is somewhat hidden from us.
Hearing him speak about how the U.S. government has single handedly changed his life forever made me take a step back. i think about what the real consequences of war are to everyday people like Basim. real consequences of war are to his family.
He himself was seriously injured. His life changed after that.
What really struck a chord with me. Basims life was first introduced to us in pictures. slides on the overhead powerpoint.
It may have been an accident. loss of innocent human life no matter where from is not something that should be taken lightly.
I chose to use this video for my post. I remember this moment in class vividly.
Its important to have something believe in. it helps people rationalize events that sometimes seem like they just shouldnt happen.
It allows people the ability to make decisions. something that is usually deemed by society a good way to act.
However, like Sam said, I find it difficult to understand. It impacts so many life decisions. They weren't even a thing when the bible was composed.
Divorce and all sorts of other things are impacted by interpretations of the bible. They are not mentioned in the bible.
As large of a book the bible is, its crazy to me that it has such an impact on modern day issues. Modern day issues aren't even mentioned in it.
This helps the catholic church. it seems they are losing touch with our generation. they can become more progressive in thinking they might be able to reconnect again.
At the end of the Skype session, I felt connected to a man that lives thousands of miles across the globe.
a single question was fixed into my mind throughout the entire Skype session. Basim is not outraged with America.
faced with a situation like Basims'. a vast majority of individuals would curse society. they will be unable to pick themselves up from the ashes following this colossal loss of life. they will be unable to pick themselves up from destruction of property.
Basim found the power within himself. He was able to reference the teachings of his religion to aid him in his struggle.
He was able to maintain his friendship with Sam. Now is eager to spread awareness. Teach us about the issues. That plague Iraq.
I am so grateful for the opportunity to become enlightened by his story.
In this video, you see one of my classmates crying while listening to Basim.
When he explained how he fought through the numbness and anger, I was overwhelmed with emotions.
Before my classmate asked this question, I thought about it.
How can I hear more personal stories from Afghanistan?
How do I, as one person, make a change?
I was able to hear. directly from someone there. his life, family, pain, etc
I agree with everything you are saying.
I would never be able to forgive. get over my anger. a foreign government accidentally did to me what happened to Basim family.
I don't know what I would do with my life. I commend Basim for staying true to his religion.
The media has no interest in putting a bad picture of the United States in the minds of the American people. when something like this happens they choose not to broadcast.
I always thought of myself as open minded. Meeting Sam, I realized that I'm not cultured at all. Listening to Sam, I realized I'm not cultured at all.
The girls would not shake hands with Sam. This realy really confused me.
Every class I find myself learning something new. I did not think i would have had the opportunity to learn. I am in this class.
This comparison was something very new to me. It served as a connection to their style of living.
Sam continued the story. He described what had happened to Basim not long ago. It made the events hit home.
The pictures of Mosul were devastating. I thought pretty hard about how harsh it would be if that had happened to a city in the US.
I thought that this was the coolest class of the semester. of the way that he set the lecture up, and brought in Basim over skype.
That was an element of the class that I was not expecting. It was even more real that the victim of the incident was right there to speak on how he felt right after we had just talked about it.
I completely agree. said in this response.
I was waiting for this video to come up again. it honestly keeps me grounded.
It really shook me up . Like you said, his life was so normal. He in no way thought that his house would be bombed that night. It showed how quickly something can be taken away from you.
I was so naive before this class. Hearing his story really opened my eyes.
Sam is right. He claims that we are misinformed. He is looking at it from a perspective that is not hands on.
We learn our information from others who are also misinformed.
I can absolutely admit it to myself. I am in a form an islamophobic.
But in the moments included in this video, Sam really put it all in perspective for me.
It was a personally amazing achievement for me to have a mental breakthrough. Our worlds aren't different.
That theme is to educate ourselves before casting judgement. We should respect others just as we want to be respected.
Overall, this video embodies one of my favorite experiences I've had. I hope we continue to have conversations like these in class.
t seems people often have trouble separating the two. they only know of a certain nation or the people from there.
People have the courage to say that their way may not be the best way. the world would be more tolerant.
This course has restored my hope in humanity. I know people who do want to change their preconceived notions.
I have more courage to speak the truth into situations. I would have stayed silent before.
you talk about the United States being a very diverse country Sharia Law established from religion would not work.
I believe a big part. it would cause chaos. religious law is interpreted. different ways for everyone.
For instance. Most Christians are seen praying, reading the Bible, or singing There are different ways people express their religion.
They use scripture in the Bible to justify their actions. They believe it is a reflection of God's work.
Its kind of something that cant really be taught.
It has to be developed through education, understanding, life experiences, and a good heart.
I didnt care to research. reach out to someone. learn what living there is like.
I believed the media. what you understand. an American point of view.
This is what people need to do. It's unfortunate that it has to be so difficult.
I agree with what youre pointing out here. We must see things from other peoples points of views.
If not, nothing will ever change.
I think President Bush was a selfish president. He did nothing but bankrupt our country. He started an unnecessary war in search of money and oil.
The bombing of the twin towers helped get the people of America behind the war at first. not long after did we realize how horrible of a decision going to war was.
Another example of America interfering. It is none of our business.
He did attempt to withdraw troops. The wars and fights over power continued throughout his presidency.
I think Trump,Bush are a lot alike. they will go down two of our worst presidents in history.
to wrap up my comments, I agree 100% with Basim in his statement. our presidents are all the same, they all suck.
he talks about he is going to talk about many different types of groups like Asian, Hispanics others.
people commit the same crimes. why are we allowed to talk about others differently?
What it is like for people who are not white to live in America? We should just learn their perspectives. We should learn how they feel about the American culture.
I cant imagine forgiving America. something like this happened to me.
Then again, maybe thats because. Im not particularly religious.
Maybe there's a correlation behind that. I can't judge this trend off of just Basim and me.
I've never considered myself a particularly forgiving person. I know forgiveness is a major tenet of many major religions.
someone did something to my sister, family. maybe I wouldnt be able to be moral, forgiving.
unfair judgement. muslims receive. the christians. part of a lack of knowledge and understanding.
I always think that Sam is helping restore the faith in humanity. every single group of seven hundred. a half people that take this course each semester.
I had to comment on this post. I relate a lot with what you said.
I find myself mad at something. It is really hard for me to just forget and forgive.
I think this is the reason that this question was asked last year. I'm not the only one that thinks like that.
You said you don't know if you'd ever be able to forgive. I'd have to say that I would handle it slightly differently.
I would be very angry at first. I don't know anyone that wouldn't be angry. I can see how Basslim has come to forgive Americans like he had.
I had come to the same conclusion. doing that he was able to spread his story in a much more meaningful way.
I would like to share my thoughts on Sam's last class. The rights are regarding Muslim women wearing hijabs.
Initially, I thought they wore the Hijabs. it was written in the Quran.
Mulsim women were told to wear hijabs only when going outside. The muslim girls wear hijabs in the presence of male strangers.
They were able to focus their attention towards their work. They need not worry about the way they look.
I thought it was incredible how open. willing Basim was to tell his tragic story. relay his message of forgiveness to 700 American college students.
In the beginning of the class he stated that he teaches SOC119 every year. he will never have the same lecture twice.
This is the world's mindset nowadays. This is why the hatred is so common.
Our government's actions and beliefs shouldn't be portray every single American
The fact that Bassim is able to see past the horrible actions of our government leaders is remarkable. The media only portrays us in a negative manner.
I think it is unnecessary. American troops to be occupying. Middle East.
instead of turning the anger into hate for Americans Bassim turned it into positive energy.
Especially when he wouldn't even get an apology from their murderers.
There should be a government organization that help out people like Bassim. make sure they get everything they need to get it passed.
Basim is a great example. someone we need to look up to. this world.
What he went through and his ability to forgive are second to none. I have so much respect for him for that.
All religions across the world preach forgiveness over hatred. I can see myself being furious for a very long time. I was in Basim's shoes.
Here, I feel like our culture is an eye for an eye. It never ends well either.
I give Bassim so much credit for maintaining his cool. I give Bassim so much credit for not hating the government. The government did this cruel thing.
Bassim said that Europeans were more aware. Americans to what is happening around the world.
We focus more on what is happening in our country. which is selfish than to notice. realize that we should be doing more to help out other countries who are struggling way more than us.
listening to Basim speak, I never thought about how the United States military. government affects other countries. I had a different view on forgiveness.
I never put much thought into. government is doing to other countries.
Everyone makes mistakes. It is different. Someone's life is at risk.
The compensation offered. the United States. made me embarrassed. they werent sorry at all..
When he was asked how he doesnt hate America, his answer was extremely eye opening. I never thought about forgiveness the way he does.
I feel like everyone. I should let go of anger.
I decided right then. from now on I am going to try harder to let anger go. there are much bigger problems going on in the world.
I come from a family with many members being in the military. I have never been in a conversation regarding what happens overseas.
These early drives are what motivated the United States. The U.S. invaded Iraq sixteen years ago.
When put into simple terms like that, it almost makes war seem pointless.
We practically invade this country at our leisure. we can gain what we want from the situation. The country that is already struggling with terrorism.
it is a brutal fight. results in more citizen casualties. it does in soldiers deaths.
We never hear about what happens to families much like Basims. This lecture really struck me. This lecture really opened my eyes up to realizing that there are real people, almost identical to the people here in the towns of America, living amongst this anger that results from the war we started in Iraq. This lecture really opened my eyes up to realizing that there are real people, almost identical to the people here in the towns of America, living amongst this destruction that results from the war we started in Iraq.
I really love your response. You open are with your feeling pertaining to society.
We have now touched on the topic of what privileges come along with being white. we definitely do need to talk about the privileges that come along with being a man.
a lot of it has to do with society. it is setup to put women in a certain position less beneficial than men.
spot on. I love your outlook
It's stories like this that really put war into perspective.
to forgive what America did to him is huge. it was really for him to move on with his life. reclaim his happiness.
I think a lot of Christians have something like this on their mind, They are too afraid to say it. They fear they are saying something almost sacrilegious.
Like you said. Someone saying that all homosexuals are going to hell. Loving someone of the same sex is not hell worthy in my book.
Another good point you make is about how similar the two books are. there is still hate and conflict between the two Very odd to me.
you said that religious radicals. should not implement. force a belief. it can lead to unpleasant events.
There are religious groups who use violence in order to send their message out. To say that everyone should be following a certain religion.
We believe in karma. Some Buddhists think that the right karma involves killings for justice. It only contradicts the Buddha's teachings.
Now, there are people in Thailand who are afraid of practicing Buddhism. They are worried about radical Muslims targeting them.
He compares this to how we often do the opposite. we are a more Christian dominated country.
we can step into someone else's shoes. we wont be able to fix this issue.
I remembered Sam. making the whole room laugh. he talked about the sins. listed in the verse. that made you an unrighteous Christian.
he things that would make us unrighteous in our religions eyes are things that everyone does. It is ridiculous to think that we will be denied heaven. We are bad people.
According to the Corinthians verse we saw in class. homosexuality isn't even the worst thing you can do.
I do not understand how so many Christians and many other religions. They hide behind a verse that says homosexuality is unrighteous. They themselves have more than likely done something else listed in that same verse.
Sam brought up the point that the Quran had a part. it was very similar to the Corinthians verse he read.
you read only what you want to read. hear only what you want to hear. your opinion becomes a religious fact.
It takes a lot of courage to do what he has done.
He was able to forgive the United States. they ruined a substantial part of his life.
Sam said in class. we have to think about whether groups like the KKK are Christian.
Throughout this class. Sam is emphasizing the idea. people should learn about other cultures. this could open their eyes. so that they're not so judgmental towards people who are different from them.
I think Basim was able to forgive the United States. he is aware that the actions of the government in this case do not depict what all Americans are like.
Something sets Basim aside from most people. He has an ability to truly forgive. I think that quality is extremely underappreciated. That quality is uncommon in our society.
I agree with you that this lecture by Sam stood out. I never hear of the Establishment Cause either.
I thought that the religion stayed out of places. religion stayed out of dealing with the government.
The points you make about this video are very good ones. I agree with what you are saying.
people can like a candidate due to their religion. they would be able to bring any of the aspects of that religion into their position in the government. why does it even really matter?
I thought this. a very good point.
it was very interesting to see the perspective. we were the slaves.
I am really starting to understand. This happened years ago.
I would still be very much upset about this. They were my race.
there is one issue. wish we talk about more in class.
They couldn't find jobs anywhere, no banks would give them loans. They couldn't start their own businesses, most of the plantations were destroyed from the war.
They ended up going back to former slave owners. The were doing the same thing.
what people tend to forget about. the native Americans were treated.
we completely stripped them of their cultures. we forced them to take up western culture.
We destroyed their way of life. We killed all of their animals they would hunt. We forced them to move into these horrible reservations. They sounded great on paper. but were completely dumps.
They are just this unimportant piece of dirt They got in the way of greedy wealthy Americans.
He took a completely different path. He forgave the government. The government did this to his family. He made a positive life out of it. I give an enormous amount of credit to him.
The previous lectures have all given me that sense of lack of judgement. One lecture I found to stand out the most was the video chat with Basim Razzo.
Sam began to introduce Basim. share his story of how they met. grew to be apart of each others lives. heart immediately sank. when it announced that Basims family was innocently killed by American bombing.
Watching this video made me fairly upset. Bassim's immediate response to the question was no.
It was difficult to say something like this about the future of your country. It shows how hopeless he is.
Bassim said. this was because of all that has changed within his country.
think of ways in which. America can help. change the hardship. Iraq is going through. but there isnt much more we can do.
I was also wondering. the Iraqi citizens even want America to help them.
The Iraqi people can help their country. They can come and work together. They can find a solution for a brighter and less violent future without ISIS.
Iraq could very well stay. state of conflict. long time.
I do this via Twitter in most cases. It has the fastest publishing of information about any current event at any given time. I read newspapers.
I appreciate Sam so much. He allows us to dive deeper. We become more educated on the motivations of people.
Listening to Richard Spencer. speak in the podcast. for our first quiz. eye opening to a viewpoint. that I sometimes can't understand on my own.
I was in absolute awe. he looked like a normal man.
Sam made a good point It is easy to view the middle east as a war ridden wasteland that is populated by evil people. America has to send troops there.
he has found forgiveness. what America has done to him. I am positive not many people can do.
Hearing religion being used for law. all you ever hear about the Sharia.
They are really using this book. to do the horrible things they do.
really interesting was to see that Christians group. places like Africa do the same exact thing.
They claim somewhere in the bible. it gives them motive to kill all the infidels for not believing in Christ. they aren't the same religion they are is nauseating.
If I could talk to one of those radicals, I would ask them show me in the Sharia or Bible that it says its ok to kill people who aren't like you. don't believe in the same religion as you.
I do not know much about politics. I did watch some of the debates. most current presidential election.
I remember Trump saying how he was going to send troops back in to Middle Eastern countries. Obama had taken them out. That's why there is chaos (according to him).
This is crazy to me. I thought the United States could help change anything going on anywhere. we are powerful.
Basim said there was nothing being done about the corruption. getting worse in Iraq, I think the United States should focus on that.
He said all the money gets pocketed by those doing the corruption. that money is supposed to help the people.
Hearing from Basim and Rafi really opened my eyes. Im happy I got the opportunity to hear both of them speak!
In fact, when I got to college, I found many Christians. They alienate me in the same way because I'm Catholic.
I still love my religion. I will most likely be a Catholic until the day I die. I can't say that I am still very accepting of other religions.
I agree with Sams sentiment that people are quick to demonize people, far away, unaware of their own hypocrisy.
They are Muslims Muslims they're just Moslems. interpret their faith in a more violent way than is normal.
I sometimes wonder what would happen. more people were able to empathize with others.
People are all made differently. many of those differences can be solidified through cultural upbringing.
What most people tend to not realize. , is how trivial many of these differences are in the grand scheme of things
How would you know how this girl felt. she put on the hijab?
Not everyone views the hijab with whatever connotation you do.
you have no logic to be able to assume that these people have views. completely diverse points.
Most of your whole response is based on your own assumptions. It could be true or completely false.
you should think about what you're really saying. not everyone has the same views as the American culture views you are thinking of.
I respect that youhave strong opinions about this video. I don't think you're thinking about the big picture.
This class in particular made me very upset. We listened to Basim speak about Mosul's history with the American government.
Basim is one of many Afghans who are caught in a war. who lose so much because of it.
I can't imagine how much they suffer. I don't know how to live a life after all these things happened.
I am just amazed. the fact Basim chooses to forgive the American.
What we did in the class. not bashing America.
We discuss the truth that happened.
I am an Eagle Scout, I have done a lot of exploring myself hearing about his experiences in the desert was very interesting.
Many people experience issues. They don't have their cell phone. I find this appalling.
were going to send your children off to institutions that are supposed to better foster growth. there is no reason why events like this should not be included.
Making sure that our youth have the best possibility to succeed is in the best interests of these people. it's actually very strange that more of these programs don't exist.
I think I would be depressed. the rest of my life.
I imagine Bassim has a much different narrative. hardship is widespread in Mosul. he faced many more challenges than I did.
People are dismissing all the negativity around slavery. it happened in the past.
During the talk. felt white against black. looking that the color of your skin. determine the quality of injustice. and crimes that had been done to the people.
In general whites are always on top. we have used slave labor in many different means throughout history.
We need to remember. We talk about race wars.
The government has always been corrupt. I thought I trusted them.
Obama was president  He did a lot of things. I personally don't agree with these things. He never went to Haiti during his presidency.
How am I supposed to know? what is real news. what is news that is opinion based?
Finding facts that are true. a hard thing to these days.
The reality that some people live in this world is tragic.
I think the word itself is an eye opener. I can confuse the word meaning myself.
This is definitely a class on empathy. It just stinks. I feel like this class comes to be based off the fears sitting within the individuals in the audience. I feel like this class comes to be based off the misconceptions sitting within the individuals in the audience.
It shows courage about you that you can admit to yourself that there are things that you need to do. It shows courage to work on to be able to have empathy to others.
I like the word choice of detach. I couldnt quite pick the feeling I felt throughout every class.
I think that is one of the best gifts this class could give us as students.
I also like how Sam gets his mind set on something. He just runs with it.
I think this is also effective. It makes for the most interesting class.
He replies saying that the first few months he was numb. but became angry a while.
That is what forgiveness means to me. It does not mean condemning the offense.
This is the video I decided write my response to. How you are not angry with America.
The title of this video was one of the questions a student asked Basim Razzo.
Razzo is from Iraq. He responded to one of the talks Sam gave. They a dialogue. That is how they became close.
His response made a lot of sense. His level of forgiveness is unreal. He has an open court cause with them.
I sat down. I started talking about this situation with my friend.
This made me think of how I sometime hold grudges. I have no reason too.
soc119 is an ever-evolving class. he doesn't use preset lectures. have the same discussions every semester.
I love how we don't follow a concrete curriculum. we are learning about the world currently.
Coming to soc119 class. you will see. hear people. all around the world.
I believe being a globally aware person benefits you in various ways.
I felt this way. I was listening to the Christian lectures.
They interpret their religion in a different way It is a negative way. It burdens the reputation of their religion.
If I think of the Muslim religion I instantly think of middle eastern terrorists. In reality most Muslims are normal, kind people.
I loved what Sam said at the end of this video. You have to see them in the same way.
I think it was a great idea. Most people don't know the reason behind why some Muslim ladies wear a hijab.
I am not a Muslim. I was born and brought upin Qatar, In a country in the middle east which is a Muslim majority country.
Secondly, it was interestingto see what kind of questions. ask the girls who wore hijabs.
It was a great class where we got to know a little more. the lives of such women.
Another thing that I noticed. found fascinating is the difference in the cultures.
I agree that the laws of religion are a little blurry. They do not spell out clear answers to all the challenges we face.
Rafi has opened my eyes to life of an average resident of Afghanistan. I have been trying to think of the Middle East in a different light.
this reminds me of the video. we had to watch for the quiz.
I found this interesting. it reminded me that people like Basim from Mosul, could be similar to someone in my family.
I was amazed by how forgiving he had become. i have thought about that a lot even after class ended.
This was an amazing lesson in forgiveness. I will never forget.
I found it so cute that a found a girl from his childhood on Facebook and was messaging her.
This class has helped me to realize. Every person is different. Every person can not simply be placed into a box that makes them all the same.
I remember Sam telling us about Bassos life. He was goingto join us over FaceTime. I was expecting to see a broken man.
Instead, I met a man who had forgiven the people. The people had seemingly ruined his life
The thing is, he did not see it that way. At first he did. Over time Bazzo came to realize that the anger he was harboring was doing more harm than good. His anger hurt his process of getting over the death of his family at the hands of the American military.
I could tell as I watched him speak. He was at peace with his life. Ready to move on.
I saw the power Muslim religion gave Basso. I thought twice about the power of religion in ones life. It will apply to someones morality.
Since that day. I have come to the conclusion. Forgiveness can be learned through many mediums. One being religion. but the ability to forgive comes from within.
I agree. It is an accurate metaphor. Few people actually experience life outside of the cave.
While it should be a thrilling. Many people are afraid to step out and learn how other people live.
A country diverse. Expect there to be much more understanding between various religions.
It is the sad reality that human nature prefers to accept the incorrect perceptions. It is easier than seeking to understand on ones own.
I really agree with this statement. I've seen different rituals, traditions, religions, etc.
Theyre not all derived from the same faith. Sometimes different things work for me.
Sam is completely right. He says you really just have to go out and travel. See the world in order to get it.
I really got to see the conflict that exists in day-to-day life.
Its easy to just turn against another side. Empathy is super important.
This is a really great point Sam makes in the lecture.
If we werent so caught up with political correctness, but instead talking behind each others backs behind closed doors, we would be a lot better off.
Bassim was wronged by the US government without a doubt. The lack of compensation gave to him after his family was killed when the US bombed his home was absurd.
That was the Razzo familys horrible incident. This is the type of stuff we wont see on the news in our home country.
By a country and a culture he had grown to love.
It takes such a peaceful person like Bassim. Hatred and revenge do more damage than they do good.
He was able to make a personal connection to American people. That allowed him to overcome the stereotype our government can create. Sometimes that we like to go where we are not welcomed.
It was interesting to hear that the laws on divorce are not different from American laws on divorce. Some even less harsh, like when the husband goes missing.
People believe that Islamic women have little freedom. This is not true.
I agree with what youre saying about people. Being able to interpret the bible and other religious scriptures in any way that they want.
I was born catholic. I do not consider myself a very religious person. I do not discriminate against any other religions.
I found it very interesting. Sam talked about how the various radical Islamic groups. Follow the same scriptures. The peaceful Islamic majority.
I agree with what you are saying. Changing this class has really changed my view on radical groups.
I share the same views on the topic. The media depicting groups of people in whichever way they want.
The media has so much power in our society today. They have the power to brainwash people with their headlines.
It is how we as humans understand what others are experiencing as if we were feeling it ourselves.
When dealing with people and particular situations I often find myself putting myself in other people's shoes. I ask myself questions like Well what if I do this, how would ___ feel?
I think that everyone needs to practice empathy. Even if they are empathetic people.
There is a preconception in people's mind. It makes them discriminate.
This is the reason why there is so much hate globally.
There is an incident of Islamic radicalization it is in the news headlines. Other cases are not given the same hype.
We hear about wars due to islam and muslim killing each other, but never about other cases.
All the groups are dealing with the same issues. It is just that people like to play the blame game. But never themselves.
We start to see all the people through the same eyes we would look at us, We can start empathizing.
It is a difficult thing to do. All our lives we have believed in a particular idea. Introspection will challenge that.
I never really thought how I did judge other religions. I never consider that I should see the world through someone else's eyes.
I think society we have to see each other. In the same way in order be accepting.
It is an evolving class. To me it is really interesting and awesome.
I learn new things every class that I never considered before.
We may be the same person. Religion separates us it makes us loose the human connection.
In my post this week I mentioned a quote Sam said. If you want people to see you in a certain way you have to see them in the same way.
It is truly amazing that Basim is able to be so forgiving. Live his life without anger.
I remember him saying what good would he do if he went about his life with anger.
His religion doesn't teach hate and violence. Other twisted people interpret it differently.
In my opinion, the bible was never meant to be a law book to last throughout the ages. The bible is a history of God's interactions with man immortalized. The bible is made of stories told to give us a basic idea of what God wants from us.
I find myself sometimes stereotyping people. This class has opened my eyes. There are different ways I should be interpreting the world.
My heart sank. Basim told his story about losing his whole family to an American bombing.
Like you said towards the end of your post, I really do believe that there isnt much difference between religions. The sooner people can come to terms with that, the better off we will all be.
I think the bible is a great reference point. We need to remember what the old and new testaments are: stories.
What that means is whoever wrote them also took the word of the Lord into their interpretation.
Most of what is considered sin. What is not is left up for interpretation for the authors themselves to figure out.
I truly do not understand. How Bassim is not angry about the horrible tragedy he went through.
I was a little surprised though.
I felt uneasy at the fact the United States offered him a subordinate amount of money. That was to the point where it insulted Bassim.
I was also shocked. He wants to move back where his family was killed.
I agree that meeting Basim really helped to alleviate prejudice against Muslim people. It was due to their religion.
I definitely agree. The generalization of groups is dangerous. It makes it much easier to hate against people. We think of them as them instead of individuals.
I like how you said it shows a different side of the Middle East. I believe that really is true.
The fact that only 17 percent of Christians have a biblical worldview is eye opening. that just justifies that a majority of Christians are in a sense prioritizing certain parts of the Bible compared to others.
you pointed out that there is seven hundred in a lecture class. no one was following the Bible seriously.
What I took away from Bassos experience was that forgiveness was the hardest thing he has ever done. At the same time it was the most rewarding.
If Basso thought forgiveness was too hard. He would still be living in anguish. Over the loss of his family.
This only causes more suffering. This is a shining example. Forgiveness is so important.
We are all constantly aware of what war can do to people. We never really get an opportunity to hear it from them first hand.
The interview with Basim really made me appreciate what we have. The interview with Basim really made me treasure andn focus on all the good in my life.
Americans suffer from tunnel vision. Viewing people who are Muslims.
Many Americans choose not to view it this way. Our government is not full of saints. Sometimes the government does some pretty bad things.
Some people in the middle east feel like we're the main issue. The only way to solve it is to rebel. The only way to solve is to pull off attacks on America.
Something definitely needs to change.
The most intriguing parts to me was when he talked about the reason for his forgiveness being his religion.
They give the whole religion a stigma. Basim stated the exact opposite.
I thought that was beautiful.
You have a man who has every reason to hate. Be spiteful. He chooses to forgive. People of the race who did this to him.
I think more people should feel this way when it comes to Muslims.
Instead of categorizing everyone who is a Muslim as a disturber of the peace. Instead of categorizing everyone who is a Muslim as a creator of violence. We should see the peace that some of those people practice.
I think more people should take Basim's approach. When it comes to things like this.
It was fun. I feel like I really discovered myself.
The experiencebecomes so much better without technology. you get to know the true worth of relationships. it has a great impact on your personal health.
Basso was such an inspiring teacher. During the short time he talked in our class.
I think I will forever use his knowledge of forgiveness throughout my life.
It was truly heartbreaking hearing Basims story. It was important that United States citizens hear about this sort of tragedy. We can do our part to help in the future.
What I found was very inspirational about Basims conversation. He said that he was not angry with the United States citizens. He said that he was not angry with the U.S as a whole.
Stacy asked how he can stay so even tempered and positive after he lost those closest to him. Basim responded that he does not get angry. The anger would be the end of him.
Living in the U.S. He met some very good friends.
He brings in the fact that his religion is Muslim. His religion shapes him as a person. He follows the teaching of forgiveness. His religion helps calm him. not put the hatred on to Americans.
That was my country Vietnam. It had been at war with the United States.
Take Agent Orange. Generations suffer from its horrible toxic effects that caused deaths.
My grandmother passed away. At first I was confused. I was wondering why this was happening to me. I was not quite feeling the pain of the loss.
My feelings were very similar to feelings that Basim expressed. Our situations were extremely different.
I really like how Basim explained   I like how he came to forgive and move past his anger.
We overlook all of the good, innocent people that inhabit that place. Have nothing against us.
I think Basim teaches us. We should have forgiveness and having a good, accepting heart.
I personally would do the same. I would never quite get over it. I would never be as positive as he is.
Of course he does still blame certain people He overall has the most positive attitude I have ever seen
He lives such a different life. I never think about how other people in other countries are suffering.
It was eye opening for me in that moment. I thought that I am so blind to what is actually happening in the world.
In this class we talked to Basim, a man who even with all the sadness that has hit his life. Found a way to believe in peace.
It was a disrespectful action that Basim rejected. Now trying to sue the government for wrong doing.
He showed us where he lived. Only the war ridden sections.
It introduced me to a new view of Iraq and its people which goes to show just how unconsciously biased Americans can be.
Basim was a true gentleman. Basim was kind. It gave me a whole new perspective of everything. It got me thinking about other places that the media impoverishes. in its segments and coverage.
Every president and their associated Congress have become partisan.
Both sides believe that they know best. They refuse to compromise with the other group.
Any major decision takes significantly longer than it should.
It involves a mix of domestic, international, and financial issues. It provides the basis for countless discussions on the value and necessity of war.
We were seeing, first hand. Someone lost everything.
He had a better attitude towards life than many of the privileged people I encounter in America each day.
I was so shocked how he mentioned that he was not mad at America. Many people do not even know.
Bassim mentioned that there are other people in the world. They want to live happy, healthy lives.
I feel very lucky. I have been given an opportunity to be apart of that Skype chat.
That doesn't get talked about nearly as often as it should.
I like that Sam plays devil's advocate a lot of times.
In a college this big, we can only imagine people coming from so many different countries. People come with with different backgrounds.
It is so important to respect and understand people.
U.S. is a melting pot. It has many cultures.
I was in Indiana, listening to the ideas from people from one the most conservative states in this country. I disagree with them.
I think about how they grew up with these ideas. How the areas they live in are very rural.
I am glad Sam is teaching this in class. When we can all try to understand each other, this world would be a better place.
The overarching messages of the class are kept the same. Different topics are discussed year to year.
Religion has its place when it helps others to establish an identity. Religion has its place when it helps others to work towards being the best person that he she can be. It was understand when the Constitution was created that people are free to practice a religion. It was understand when the Constitution was created that people are free to not practice a religion. and this needs to be respected by all.
Bassim makes it clear that he runs his life in accordance with his faith. Which is to love others, not be consumed by hate or spite.
Where I find hope most from his story is that he has grown. Accepting that his life can never go back to being normal.
I wish him the best in the future. I hope that anyone who is afflicted by something can rebound in any way like he has.
He may not have had hope about the future of Mosul or even his country. There were still aspects of his life he enjoyed. He was happy to talk about them. One was his son getting married.
He had nothing to do with the war. His home was targeted. His dear ones lost their lives.
He is so forgiving. He provided that the violent bad image of Muslims is prevalent. He provided that the violent bad image of Muslims has no basis.
it is a scripture. It gives the people of the religious group something to believe in. it changed the way I see muslim people.
To obey a book that was written hundreds of years ago today just does not make sense.
Religion is a touchy subject. Religion should not be in politics.
I find this to be amazing. It can't be taught via a standard textbook-lecture course.
It's sometimes hard to fight against our own subconscious biases and misconceptions. It's necessary to flip the script. Put yourself at the other end of the discussion.
You understand. People may appear different. They're people just how we are. The window for judgment gets smaller.
He had every reason to hate. He still forgave unconditionally.
Why are we taught to hate Muslims and their motives? Muslims are just like us?
This happens to innocent people everyday. We are kept in the dark.
Our government is distracting us from the real issues they are causing. Our government are only pointing fingers at Afghans.
This class is a great eye opener. Those have thoughts about Muslims and other religions as well.
He challenges views of people.
It is distressing. I hate to see people make blind ideas.
People were killed that day. It was overlooked by Trump.
Sure, he's right. Both sides were violent. Both sides did not stand behind a violent message.
You can criticize governments and their regimes. You cannot generalize the actions of a government and apply such to their citizens.
All of the innocent people have lost their homes. They have lost their loved ones. Their belongings cannot be looked at in the same way that we looked and thought of Saddam Hussein.
This is something that I think any student who has gone. The American education system needs to listen to I really do think its important.
I agree with Basim that there is a lack of geography teaching and history teaching in our schools. We seem to only focus on U.S. matters and U.S. history.
I remember in school. My social studies history classes would have students do current event assignments.
People ignore the ideas that condemn their own actions. People instead try to deflect the attention onto a small group such as homosexuals.
The bible does say being a homosexual is a sin. Fornicators are sinners Sodomizers are sinners. Much more are sinners.
Christian sharia has taken all the attention off of people. Its been forced on a group that is more easily oppressed in homosexuals.
The church needs to be held accountable. What it actually says.
People may change their actions. They may stop saying they truly live by the Bible. They know what the real text says.
He said at first that he was so upset by what had happened that he was numb for a while. He was angry for a short amount of time.
But he continued, I felt that anger would just eat me from the inside. How it was hurting him to be angry, more than it was helping him.
I think it's awesome. He judged Americans by the nice people that he met. He was here.
When there are children involved the time separated increases.
I find this interesting. In this video, getting a divorce according to the Quran is far simpler and much faster.
Divorces in the US are different. Divorces are very similar to the ones in Afghanistan. One major thing is the money aspect.
The father has to pay the wife the money for all of the needs of the wife and the kids. This is only until the kids reach the age of either sixteen or eighteen.
It is agreed upon that the father has to pay all of the money that he had promised his wife at the time of their wedding.
It kind of depends on how badly she wants the divorce.
I myself am an advocate of that. My parents have been divorced for many years. I live primarily with my mother. I see my dad often. but I have never had to live with him full time.
Another thing that I found interesting was that the man can say he wants a divorce. that doesnt mean that it is going to happen, there is a process just like there is over here.
They say that he just has to say he wants a divorce. It can happen. That is actually false according to our speaker.
His family was killed in a bombing by the United States military. One student asked him how he was not more mad at the US for what happened to him.
He said that he was not mad anymore. It was only going to eat away at him.
He was numb and angry for a few months. He realized that feeling that way provided no benefits to him.
It was a great move by Sam to bring in Bassim. It showed us that people on the other side of the world go through a lot of difficult times. We pay no mind to them.
It put a lot of things in perspective for me. It really showed me something. An exam that I have next week is not really all that important.
I thought that his mindset is an exceptional way to overcome hardships. More people should approach difficult times in their life. With this mentality.
I know that. It is much easier said than done. Bassim is right.
I am no exception to sulking. I can imagine something bad happening to me. I can't imagine losing my family like he did.
What is the point of holding the Bible in such high light? Those who call themselves Christian do not even use the book in the means that it is meant for.
The Bible is so well known and 'followed'. It is put in hotel rooms for free.
This is confusing to me. Someone not religious in the slightest.
Christians choose not to follow their book. Yet they call many Muslims terrorists for following theirs?
why don't let the book influence all of their decisions?
Pretending to understand the divine. Utilizing this understanding to create laws. Everyone must follow is authoritarian at best. Undermines what it means to live freely.
I believe we should have freedoms in our life. I believe we should practice our own religions. I believe we should exist in a society where laws are not based on any one persons religion.
Stacy asks Basim why he isn't angrier at the United States. The bombing of his home.
Basim chose to forgive. that is what his religion tells him to do.
Yet, the problem is that this happens all the time. We don't even realize it.
This conversation sparked many emotional reactions. This was the closest anyone has ever experienced the travesties of war. The travesties were on their own side.
I would never forget. Basim still hangs on to a hatred of the American government.
I found it interesting. He stated that the main reason we went into Iran was to gain political control for access to the oil in Iran.
If I were in his position, family murdered, house gone, belongings lost, with little to no recognition by the public, I would not be able to keep as composed as Basim.
It is extremely important to throw away the labels. We have on people.
We all have our own original ideas about things. It is hard to listen to someone who disagrees with you. Mentally we reject their ideas.
We should step into their shoes. We should listen to their opinions to understand them.
There is always something valuable of peoples talk. we listen in their own perspective.
I would be miserable. I didnt forgive people
Spending all of your time hating people is not a positive way to live life. Never moving forward is not a positive way to live life.
That's the power of religion. God helps us forgive others. They have no reason to be forgiven.
I think that in most cases it is ones ignorance. It makes them not want to see both sides of the story.
People feel strongly connected to beliefs that they have had since a young age.
It is not hard to believe. People simply choose not to accept others beliefs. They think theirs is right.
Looking at a situation through a different persons view. We can see aspects of everyday life that we have not considered before.
the day in class in which women wearing hijab discussed what life is like. I never considered the fact that they enjoyed not caring about doing their hair. Worrying about someone thought of the way they looked.
Opportunities like this one would not be possible. The person is willing to consider others beliefs.
Without the ability to accept difference. people will never understand each other .
I agree with the points you bring up in your response.
You brought up is the interpretation aspect of the Bible.
David, I felt the same way. We were in class during the live streams with Bassim.
As an American, I can not fathom what it would be like to have a group of people come to my home. I can not fathom a group of people tell me how to live my life.
It is easy to forget that it is happening all over the world . It normally does not make the headlines for the news.
He brings a lot of issues to light. Many of us forget about these issues on a daily basis.
I think it was a general consensus in the class. The way Bassim and his people are being treated is a tragedy.
Having Basim talk to our class showed that every little decision that is made internationally can have a huge effect on a person that lives in that country. We would not even know.
The devastating reality of having this happen to anyone is appalling. Bassim lost family members, his house, and items that are irreplaceable. My government dropped a bomb on them.
I think about everyone else this has happened to. How do they cope with the situation? Are others able to put violence that has been done to them in the past? Are others able to forgive like Bassim?
I was heart broken. I heard Basim talk about his house being bombed.
A student went up, asked why he wasn't angry. he said it was what his religion taught him.
I'm not religious. I don't think I could get over something like that.
The media in the United States should have showed us more what Iraq was like. We could understand what is happening when there is a bombing there.
I though Iraq was very different.
I feel very strongly about the topic. I agree completely with your post.
I am speaking like a Christian. This would be difficult to enforce in the United States.
Everyone interprets things differently. There is no way we could live our lives following these books step by step.
What is the most interesting to me is that his religion.
He survived. He believes there is a reason God let him survive.
I just think Basim's answer is beautiful. It should be a message to everyone.
He also mentioned that American people had always showed him kindness. The problem lied with the government.
I think there are 2 takeaway lessons in Basim's response.
Many Americans can take this lesson. Thinking about muslims. Anyone with a middle eastern background.
The second lesson is that Basim is actually living correctly in accordance to his religion.
Not just Basim's religion says that. Not all religions do.
Looking back, I think this is because it is something that is happening so far away from me. Thus I'm not able to sympathize.
I really don't everyone who was bombed will have the same feelings. Reactions that Basim did.
I know that I would not be able to react the same way that he did.
Think that we are merely atoms ruled by an unknown force. This can be an extremely saddening thought for some people.
The simple act of thinking of them. Makes some people feel so lost and depressed. Life does not seem worth living.
Individuals who feel completely hopeless without it. No one truly knows what is really happening. Religion provides a peaceful answer to some.
It was just crazy to me to even think. Our country mistakenly dropped a bomb in his area. It took the lives of his loved ones
What I believe is even crazier is that no one even stopped to talk about the people that this bomb killed.
Bassim lost some of the most important people in his life. It was not put in the newspaper. It was not talked about in the news.
The bomb caused him so much pain. The bomb was basically irrelevant to the rest of the world.
The student in Soc 119 asked if Bassim was mad at the United States for dropping the bomb. I immediately thought that he would be somewhat resentful. As much as I hate to say it our country is constantly hurting his.
To my surprise and I am sure to everyone else's surprise Bassim showed empathy.
Empathy is something that brings us all together. It allows for a connection. Empathy can help us grow as a people.
It is hard to have empathy for someone that you have distanced yourself from socially and culturally.
I think that soc 119 is a great step.
How could he stay so calm? He was telling this story.
he able to talk about it. it was just a normal day.
I could not even imagine losing my family due to an accident. I could not even imagine going on living my life. Still, being the same happy person that I am
Basim was laughing with us. Basim was telling his story as if it was not as bad as it sounds.
The fact that Basim was able to forgive. The Americans for a devastating event in his life. Truly amazing.
I don't think that I would have been able to do the same and I feel I speak on behalf of everyone when I say that.
I have gone to Catholic school my entire life. Believe fully in God's power.
It is such a hard thing to be able to forgive those who have done you wrong.
It is an even harder thing to forgive. You don't know who the person was.
I can't decide if it is morally right. For someone to pick and choose like that.
On one side, I do understand the fact that people want to believe in a higher power. Follow the bible by which power preaches.
Do we really have such different beliefs?
I found the way Bassim was not angry very surprising too.
If I was put in Bassims shoes I would never be able to live it down. If my family was blown up by foreign bombs I would never be able to live it down.
I think everyone can learn a lot. From the way he deals such awful situations.
I think people can take a lot away from this. It shows that sometimes you need to keep going with life. Work to change what happened instead of dwelling on the horrible acts.
Bassim truly opened my eyes to the truth. I see what is happening in other countries due to war.
I was so shocked that someone could be so forgiving. He should teach us rather than letting his anger control him.
I liked how you mentioned that many of us swear by our religion. We probably could not live by it in this situation.
The fact that he can use this. A way to put his life into faith. Amazes me.
His outlook on life is incredible. I feel so lucky. I have gotten a chance to be educated by such an inspiring person.
I learned a few things that I didn't know before. Women who want to be separated from their husbands have to have one of four reasons to explain their decision.
The husband is still required to give to his wife the money that was promised at their wedding.
Honestly, I thought that Muslim culture regarding marriage was entirely different from that in America. I was surprised to find out that that is not exactly the case.
The ability for the class to actually interact with someone who has experienced the brutal side of war I thought was an interactive lesson with empathy.
Basim said he had no other choice but to turn to his Muslim faith in order to feel somewhat better.
He trusted that his religion would guide him through his life. Would give him the strength to move on and cope.
I believe Basim is truly an amazing person. His courage is inspiring. His strength is inspiring.
Basim said that ever since ISIS came around. Everything has changed. Countless innocent people have been hurt.
The bombings are what really surprises me.
I really give it to Basim. Basim is able to talk about this. Basim does not feel so much hatred for the United States.
Ido not know if I would be able to put it all behind me.
Basim said that most people are spread out. I am interested to see how things are going to play out.
I had a long talk with my mom. she told me whenever she was stuck, she would pray.
I don't really remember why or how I stopped going to Church. In the back of my mind, I knew it was wrong.
I began to pray more. I was in a tough situation.
That comes with open mindedness. Not making yourself closed off from any sort of rhetoric.
That's why Sam says Cs get degrees. We all die. Nothing matters.
I don't think he's stating obvious facts. It's just the perspective he has on life. It's what actually living means.
I couldn't even begin to imagine. I knew that my family was buried somewhere.
During the Skype interview. The question that kept on popping into my head was also, how is he not mad?
I agree with you. In his shoes, I would have so much animosity towards people. The people killed so many members of my family.
I don't believe that people should follow it word to word.
Like you said, times have definitely changed. The world has evolved. It does not make sense to follow everything the Bible states.
innocent people that are being killed The amount is very alarming.
To lose almost your entire family. In the blink of an eye. Is a very chilling thought.
I have nothing but respect for Basim. Basim is able to keep living.
This is what the war is now. It was nothing but drone strikes.
We are so used to using our drone strikes to handle the work for us.
We dont see that aftermath.
All we see is our target being destroyed through a screen. Who knows how many miles away it is.
Sometimes the intel for these drone strikes are bad.
Basims had all his children taken away from him. It was all done suddenly.
I attended Catholic school when I was young. I practice my faith regularly. I also do strongly believe in the separation of church and state.
I think it is great to have faith in some support of religion. It can give people a sense of purpose in their lives.
Having the faith that there is someone there throughout their daily lives, listening and watching over them. It can be very beneficial for those who need the idea of hope to carry on when times are bad.
I do not believe the Bible or the Quran should dictate how a person should go about their life.
you think what they do is wrong.
I would have never thought of it. it plays in very well here.
I feel like if people could just experience life of other people for a day, they would realize that we are all the same.
People take things out of context. Extreme with promoting their ideals.
you stated in your response. I also believe that people need to focus on the positive messages in each text. These messages include how to be a good person, and forgiveness
I think that individuals who do believe in God should use their messages to guide. Not treat what is written down in the bible law.
It is imperative that people keep their free will.
Sam prefaces day seven of class. Diving into what exactly this class is.
Thus Sam has to tailor his lectures to whatever the issues are present at that time are.
He attempts to show that these radicals in religion. Just apparent in the middle east but in the US.
Overall, this is what I believe Sam tries to achieve with every lecture. Whether it be about Islam, African-Americans, Asia. Whatever the topic, he attempts to provide perspective.
I wrote about the topics you wrote about. I could not agree more.
It definitely was an eye opening class. I had not put much thought into how our government impacts other countries civilians.
They should be willing to offer Basim anything that he wants. What they did to him.
I was expecting him to be furious with our country. That is how I would be feeling.
Everything that Basim said was really interesting. I plan on keeping up with what happens in Mosul.
We can often get into our own heads that we are comfortable with our lives. I believe we should always push our boundaries.
it unsettling that the first thing people think about is anger. people think about is anger in a situation like this
Of course, some events have valid reasons to be upset at. At the same time, Bassims point that the anger only hurts you. Anger does not benefit you in any way. That is the key in life.
It was very eye opening to see something so horrible happen. How has he made it through. How has he been able to not have a hatred towards Americans.
For him to be so resilient and get through such a hard time really shows a lot about him. No matter how far apart we are we all go through inner conflicts. Some are much worse than others. We all go through inner conflicts. and face choices.
I loved the sodomy example.
I would say the majority of the class identifies themselves with a certain religious group. Seeing the hands go up really makes you scratch your head.
It's pretty scary as well when you take into account the level of ignorance in this country. It's scary how the media has weaponized it against people subtly.
This class was great at eliminating our western belief. Women who wear a hijab are not being oppressed. Wearing a hijab actually empowers these woman. Wearing a hijab allows them to be much more comfortable. and free in their own skin.
One of the problems in my opinion with the lesson is that Sam skipped over part of the western oppression argument.
Think about how often our laws here in America are amended. If we still followed every law exactly how it was originally written in 1787. Our society would be very different.
Many things written in the Bible can be viewed differently by different people. we cant go up to ask Jesus. hey what did you mean by xyz? we interpret how we want to, which might be different than how our Christian neighbor interprets in.
If I was in that situation, I'm not sure that I would be able to completely forgive
America ruined everything he had. It hardly gave him anything in exchange.
I'm not implying that money could have equivocated the lives that were lost. The least America could have done is give him enough money to cover the costs of the funerals. The least America could have done is buy him a new house that was equal in value to the one that was destroyed.
I am really glad that Basim has allowed Sam to open up to us about his story. I think that it is really eye opening to see how quick someone else's life can be ruined in a matter of seconds.
How is that we can murder thousands of innocent lives. Just a flick of one finger.
At the same time there are so many evil human beings out there. We cannot just let them roam free.
I honestly feel that using these unmanned bombs is the safest answer for the United States. They are more so thinking about the innocent lives that make up their troops, than the men, women, and children who live in Afghanistan.
I am trying to ask myself this. The only way I can justify it. I imagine my father, brother, or sister in the army.
It is unfair for Afghan people and I wish there was a different solution because after hearing Basim's story, I wish there was something I could do for them.
We dont realize how lucky we are. We live in a country that is not torn apart by war like those in the middle east.
We really are grateful. We are not having constant danger every time we walk out the door.
It really put it in to prospective when you compare ISIS to the KKK.
As soon as most people see a Muslim. They jump to conclusions. Islamic radicles.
I agree that same does make it seem like the world could be a better place. His positive out look on things.
Sam later talks about how businesses in some states. The right to discriminate against people. It goes against their beliefs. Having pastors and other religious figures. to deny marrying someone based off their personal beliefs.
Jesus did not go to the people who were well liked and accepted in society. He went to the outcast. He went to the downtrodden. He gave them hope.
I really appreciate what you said about feeling guilt. We all should feel some guilt. It was our country.
Growing up in a post-911 society. Bassims story made me start to think a lot about the military.
They were just normal people living their everyday life. An accident with the military changed that.
This is something that American media usually does not talk about.
It is really interesting to hear his thoughts. It is inspiring how he carries on in his life without hate for the United States.
A foreign nation destroyed everything that I care about. I don't know how I would react.
After World War II, veterans returned home to the United States . An economy that was now booming.
He allows the current events that are relative in our own lives come to fruition. They become the topic of our class.
The instructor is willing to be free. His teaching techniques has many advantages.
What he teaches is fueled by passion and curiosity, not because he has to.
He doesn't grow tired of lessons. There is always something new and different.
Sam explains that we have been focusing on Islam. He feels that it is a relevant topic. In our lives today.
A member of the KKK carries out his heinous acts in the name of his Christian god. We do not make that connection.
His spirit is inspiring. I think that a lot of people can take a lot away from what he said. They should.
Ever since I had started taking photographs, I have personally experienced a growth in feeling empathy for others.
I look through my pictures I see the people I have shot I sit and think about the things they could be going through
Many others began to take a step back. Many try to understand someone else's story. I believe that things would be different.
Trying to understand another person takes time.
For some strange reason, people no longer want to take time out of their day to learn about something that benefits them.
We need to stop living selfishly.
we can step back and come together there would not be so many stereotypes and generalizations
I believe this is the kind of thing that may never happen. many will always judge , not take time out of their life.
It is not our cultural norm to give every guest a gift.
Sam and the lieutenant have both spent a ton of time in Afghanistan They have nothing but positive things to say about it.
The activity that stood out to me throughout these two weeks was the the last one of the week. They pulled down four girls who didnt wear hijabs. They pulled down four girls who did wear hijabs. They got to ask each other questions.
I loved this activity. In a normal everyday setting just walking down the street I would never strike up a conversation with a random person. I would never ask them why they wore what they wore. I would never ask them what it meant to them.
The comment this particular girl made was cool. It made me realize that not as many people as I thought are THAT offended by what other people wear. Sometimes they even think the clothes you have on are cute.
I think after listening and watching this activity. I've learned it's good to ask questions. Have conversations. With people you usually wouldn't.
It's something we were all wondering while listening to him speak.
I do think that Basim Razzo's time spent in America. A large factor that allows him to have that quality.
It's great that Basim is able to understand. The main problem is not with our people. The main problem is with our government.
Lastly, I think the way Basim perceives his religion is what helped him to completely get through this tragedy.
I may not directly follow a specific religion. I believe having a belief system in anything can guide someone through a tragedy.
I know that I would not be able to handle something. It is heartbreaking like losing my family.
The way he explained it made me reflect that it is true. Being angry was not going to make the situation any better.
He talks about how he lived in America for eight years. While he was living here he met friends that were helpful and good to him.
I like how he thinks of the good things that he lived in America. His friends who had nothing to do with the situation.
I think that is very good of him. He is not creating hate.
He talks about forgiveness. Which I think is very important. If you do not learn how to forgive you will not be able to move on.
His family members were killed by the United States. He was still extremely genuine and forgiving. He spoke to us.
I had a different perception about Iraq. Which was interesting.
We have families. We have needs to fulfill.
we form relationships with people in different parts of the world. by believing what we see on the media then we can have a more accurate understanding of the world around us.
I have distant family in Ireland. I do not communicate with them too often.
After this lecture. I messaged my Aunt on Facebook. See how she was doing. Find out more about her life in Ireland.
Through this simple gesture. I am able to get a better grasp on life.
I like how Mohamed touches on the idea. A majority of Americans do not have a clear understanding of what is happening in foreign countries.
Mohamed is right when he says we should all feel a little more empathy for others. In the end we are all humans. We will all die someday.
On the subject of marriage. I found it interesting how different reality and our perception are.
We were influenced by many wrong facts. They blind us in many ways.
Many of us have become desensitized to the violence and death that happens across the world.
We begin to ignore the news. Not view they deaths as people, but statistics.
We began to see these conflicts from a new perspective. We learned how far forgiveness can get a person.
This, in itself, is a very powerful image that Sam portrays.
I think Sam did this to really drive home that the War in Iraq is very real. It wasn't fought on US soil, Lives were affected in such a deep way.
I agree that this 7 minute lecture really summarized what Sam teaches in this class we all want to understand other cultures other than our own. this lecture showed us how to begin doing that.
I love the point you make.
I'm somebody who has struggled to forgive.
This is something I've been working on.
It made me realize we can not let our bad experiences. That may alter our lives forever, create hate.
There are times where I let a misandrist mindset take control of my thoughts.
I have to recognize that this is happening. I have to realize it's not right. I have to change the way I think.
You also don't have to verbally forgive the people who have treated you poorly.
America has destroyed their life. It is impossible for me to understand that those people who are suffering are not going to hate American.
I believe I am not the only one who thinks in this way.
The war that caused by American. The people from the whole world think. Iran people are all terrorist.
He said he was warmed. American back at the time he lived in USA warned him.
He explained his belief and religion told him to forgive
Looking back through the past two weeks there is so much knowledge we have gained on other cultures.
I love these movies. I have a hard time time wrapping my head around the daily lives of so many affected by violence.
What is common between the movies. Was people's lives.
I really enjoyed hearing him say about training the soldiers for the culture.
That is so important and beneficial I would like to further find information out about what they learn I would like to find out how the soldiers have to form a sense of trust.
Another good point is conflict is inevitable obviously in a position like his. Having the knowledge is extremely important. It doesn't end in the death of the human.
I think culture is important. Culture is vital when it is respectful.
Learning more information about culture is so powerful.
All I can really think about is that same question.
There is no sense in hating someone.
You can surely hate something that they have done. Extending your anger in other directions is pointless.
Numbness that will carry on with you forever. You can't seem to let it go.
I believe that religion should not get in the way. Each person has different beliefs.
Religion gets in the way. It causes many disagreements.
I think it is cool that your high school had a supreme court case.
I definitely think that it was wrong making someone recite the bible verse at the beginning of class especially if you do not belong to the same religion.
This makes the person feel excluded. They do not have the same religious beliefs.
Kofi, I can agree with your statements. We can not move forward as human beings. We struggle to learn from past history.
This lead to people becoming more excepting of others. they no longer see immigrants a problem but see them like victims.
I decided to do my discussion post on the video A Class on Empathy. It was important to note why Sam talks about the things he does.
He brought up that talking about how Islam is important. All we see is a lot of Islamophobia in our country today. I absolutely agree with it.
Both sides have those types of people. Majority of Americans unfortunately fail to see it in their own people.
It really makes you think. You generalize groups of people. After something big happens. In the news or anything like that.
Sam started explaining Basims story. It broke my heart.
It made it even more powerful. I found out Basim was going to speak to our class.
I was shocked. I saw him on the screen.
At first, I did not even understand. Why would be want to interact with Americans? I know if I was in his shoes, I would have so much anger. I would most definitely hold a grudge.
The American troops entrance into Iraq following the events of 9 11 were justifiable. The bombings of Basim people's homes were not.
Reading the post that Basim sent to Sam was genuinely sad.
The tragedy that Basim survived doesn't downplay what happened here on 9 11. The tragedy that Basim survived doesn't undermine what happened here on 9 11. It most certainly made me realize that the utter destruction of individuals lives didn't stop here.
I appreciate his honesty towards the questions that were asked. I admire his strength experiencing such an imaginable tragedy that he did
I felt that it was worth it for me to respond.
I did not actively choose to stop going. I just did not feel a need to anymore.
I felt that it was almost in-genuine and hypocritical for me to go to church. It is just something that does not speak to me on a personal level.
I believe that no one should judge others or be judged. It doesn't matter what kind of person they are.
He jokes with Sam. Last time Basim spoke to a Soc 119 class someone asked the same exact question.
He speaks of his great relationships with Americans. He says something truly unbelievable.
This story is really inspiring. With all the issues facing our country today forgiveness is not really talked about enough.
I think if more people were willing to listen to his story of forgiveness , perhaps people would take what they learned. Perhaps people would put it into their daily lives as well.
Your only exposure to a country. Is videos of Humvee's. Tanks patrolling the streets. Your bound to view them in a certain light.
Either way, it is concerning. Your views may be being controlled by someone else.
I enjoy Sam's discussions are designed to make you think a little bit ask questions.
My perception of the area was definitely colored. The negative images that are propagated by the major media outlets in the United States.
He answerd that his Islamic faith taught him to forgive. It guided his life-path past the anger he felt. His wife, daughter and other family members were killed in an American bombing.
I thought this was a beautiful lesson. One that members of Christian backgrounds would do to recognize as similar to the beliefs on forgiveness within Christian faith denominations.
Divides are very readily drawn between Christianity and Islam. I see an irrefutable sameness in this belief.
I was surprised at Basims next statement. He did not hate Americans. He hated the American government.
In Basim's shoes, I think that I would have a very hard time distinguishing between the two.
We do not know about the Quran. A lot of people assume that the Muslim faith allows for these acts of violence. It doesn't.
We are really quick to say that someone who commits a crime claiming to be Christian, is not a Christian.
Some of these same people are quick to call middle eastern terrorists Muslims.
The issue is that people do not do any research on the religions that they are prejudiced against.
I completely agree with Bassim. He explains that the media in the United States has a lot of control on how others, including ourselves, view war and people from different parts of the world.
I know that I sometimes forget that the people. I read about in news articles.
Bassim stressed that Americans need to memorize geography. Get to know it on a more personal level.
The action taken by Bassim is something beautiful.
I agree with you that religion is a powerful thing. Many live their lives for a religion.
Bassim has shown an amazing action of forgiveness. He is a man of his religion.
You can buy another house. a home is built around family. you lose your family nothing will ever feel like home anymore.
We need to take away all the lessons from this interview.
He was not being blind to the media. These are some of the worst times in other peoples lives in other cultures.
We should be able to forgive even the worst possible situation. It will negatively impact our lives living with the resentment.
I do not really follow politics. Watch the news often.
I knew we were in war with Iraq.
I realized that they had a life. That most of us live every day in safety.
I was truly heartbroken when I saw pictures.
I saw pictures of his wife and daughter. They died during a bombing in Mosul.
It was just a bomb. This happens on a daily basis.
Humans share the same core values. It is wrong to stereotype a whole religion based on people.
But to kill one sniper, seven houses were destroyed.
It was really interesting to how Basim was angry at first. Basim realized that the anger was hurting him more than it was helping him overall.
Debates dont really shift my opinion.
Sam kept bringing up one strong statistic. It grabbed my attention.
The commercials and edited pictures were entertaining. They carried a message behind them.
I realized that the issue of racism seems like it is better than it was 30 years ago. In reality, the statistics are the same.
It really is true when people say that the news portrays only what they want to portray. It is true, it means sabotaging the truth. It makes people look bad.
This whole time I have believed. Afghanistan is a place of war and horror. We dont get insight on what actually of is.
We arent the only people in the world that have to deal with war.
I loved learning about the Muslim religion. The reason for his peace is because of that.
It was beautiful.
Sam never sticks to a set path of what exactly needs to be covered. He goes with the flow of things.
His excitement for the material makes it easy to engage in something unassuming to me.
Never have I thought about the class in this way. Watching this clip it was a very fitting title.
Sam connects this example to the class theme of empathy. I could not agree more. we put ourselves in anothers shoes we are able to see the world in a complex way. leading to intellectual growth , development.
Hearing from an person living in the midst of war Really put things into perspective.
To think my country actually invaded this country. Participated in the destruction of this mans city is insane.
It shocks me knowing that I thought America is only out to save people. Were ruining peoples lives in the process.
I couldnt imagine putting myself in this mans shoes. Going through what hes gone through.
he showed us the picture of Mosul after the destruction. I was completely astonished. A city can be in ruins so badly.
It went from a beautiful place. War was not going on there.
It makes me wonder. Will Mosul ever get back to the way it used to be?
The only real concern I have is why he wants to move back to Mosul.
I remember in class him talking about how the United States offered him a small amount of money. They accidentally bombed his house, killing his family, injuring him and destroying everything he owns.
There are some things in the Bible that are written very plainly with very little room for interpretation.
Faith is a very individualistic idea. There needs to be a general consensus for teaching purposes.
Each denomination has a different idea. This is how it should be taught.
These disputes should solely be to seek clarification into the other persons ideas. To possibly get to know them better.
I can't say I know understand what he's been through. It would of been hard to find forgiveness.
Although, in one part of the video he did mention that he lived in America for a few years. He had friends. He thought they were all good people. Hearing him say that made me realize. I sometimes I do blame others for one's decision.
With every situation I've had with someone. She always tells me to find a way in my heart to forgive.
Living with hate won't get me anywhere in life. It won't undo what's already done.
She always said to forgive.
I felt this was one of the most intereting, insightful lectures of the year. I got a chance to hear directly from a person who has experienced everything that Basim Razzo has had to endure.
Throughout the year. We will get the chance to meet more people of different cultures. Different backgrounds. Who can give us insight into their daily lives. just as Basim was kind enough to do.
People are so busy fighting about their differences. They end up neglecting all of the things that make them similar.
And even further than that they usually have more in common than not in common. They do not see it. They are so focused on the things that they differ in.
To see the very person whom these things happened to sitting there was emotionally jarring.
It was a very unique opportunity to get to talk to Basim. It was a very unique opportunity to ask him things that we were curious about.
We react with violence in order to drive them out. We associate the regimes themselves with violence.
The US military that put his life in danger above all else.
Empathy is so powerful.
Its amazing what emotion can do.
After the conversation with Basim, I find myself disgusted by the America that we live in.
Is anything we learned about the U.S. true. Just some twisted story to make us seem like the Good Guys?
I possibly do to help these people find retribution?
I think it was amazing that he took the time to speak with us. It made the situation that much more real.
The war is such an ongoing phenomenon. They tend to put its importance on the back burner.
You have to try to forget yourself. Imagine their situation. How life must appear to them.
A small radicalized group believes thats what Islam is telling them. Mean that the rest of Muslims agree.
Its very easy to generalize about a certain group of people. You arent part of that particular group.
With President Trump proposing more aggressive military action and behavior in the Middle East I fear that the United States may be soon causing more harm to these people. This will subject them to more poverty instead of protecting them and allowing them to rebuild their homes.
I realize this is a very difficult and complex subject. I hope that we can find a way to combat terrorism going forward. I hope that we do not put families and ordinary people in the crossfire.
First, is that this is not the first time a lot of us have heard about incidental deaths from bombings in the war. We don't really talk about it.
Having Basim talk about it allowed us to empathize. This grants a much deeper understanding.
If we do not, we may continue. To ruin the lives of innocent others. Like Basim and his wife.
I agree with Sam. He says we need a new perspective. Now the christian community has an opportunity to look upon itself as Muslims would look over on us. Now we can start to think about the world in a more complex way.
This video allows us to step in somebody's shoes. See what the world looks like in their eyes.
Sam said something that really struck me. It made me think.
We live in what he calls a Christian Land.
That is when we let our guard down the most.
I thought about a crime show I used to watch.
A Muslim man noticed this. He tried to help her, but she completely ignored him. She ran the opposite direction, right into the white males trap.
I can assume that this Is because we have this fear instilled in us. people of different race, religion and color.
However, there are white Christians who can me monster
Bassim was not angry with America nor resenting what happened. his comfort in what has altered his life forever is his faith.
Bassims faith is rooted in God. He puts his hope in him.
It is not alarming to me that someone who has a faith background handles a devastating situation like his in the way he did. I think it brings up important questions about what role religion plays in someones life, no matter what religion they identify themselves with.
This is to those who do not believe. What do you run to?
I think a lot of times when bad things happen in our world, people often go point their fingers at God. People wonder WHY he would ever harm his people world.
But I think the way Bassim looks at it. He knows God is in control.
It was so heartbreaking to hear him open up about how he coped with his loss.
From what Ive seen in my own life, I think most people feel this way when they lose someone that they love a great amount. I think they feel this way when anything as traumatic as this happens.
I understood how he felt anger. I know that is another normal response to a situation of that degree.
I thought it was truly amazing that he was able to take that anger and do away with it. He knew that if he kept all of it and continued to be angry he would never be able to move on.
Take your time to think about it. This is truly terrifying.
I also like how Basim rather than bash America, does the complete opposite. He starts complementing us. He even saying he loves America.
You made a good point. You wrote about forgiveness.
If people could learn to forgive I really think the world would be a much safer place.
History will continue to repeat itself. People need to learn to coexist. They should be more willing to forgive those who have wronged them .
It was inspiring. I believe everyone was able to take something away from that class.
I definitely agree with you that there is a huge generational gap. In terms of acceptance of differences.
communities of certain racial ethnic groups may have never encountered someone who wasnt like them.
I cannot believe how strong his character is in that he has to ability to look forward. Not spend his whole life condemning those who killed his family.
It is very interesting that Basim was so calm. It is very interesting that Basim laughed when our class skyped him.
Not being able to go back to your home is a terrible feeling. I really hope he gets to return home soon.
One thing stuck with me from Basim speaking to us. He told us to try to make peace with whomever we can.
Right now, we live in a world where hate is always around us. As human beings, we need to be able to focus more on peace than hate.
In Basims case, he stopped hating those who killed his family. He knew that hateful actions would not help with anything.
We see this all the time, even as recently with the hurricanes that have come through the south recently
Its very easy for us to sympathize with people in Houston or Miami that speak the same language as us. We see them in the news every day and may even be our friends or family members.
By being able to engage with many different people. Due where they are from.
I found the topic of divorce very interesting. divorces are becoming increasingly popular in America
It happens in most religions including Christianity. I believe Judaism divorces are strongly discouraged.
I like the fact that in Afghanistan even after a couple is divorced, the male is still held accountable for his family. When divorced a man is still required to provide for them unless the woman states otherwise.
Child support in America is weakly enforced. Allows the men to get away with not paying.
He soon realized that his bitterness would only tear him apart. He owed it to his family to keep living.
It is Basim's faith as a Muslim that guides him through. He lives his life as a noble and morally good person.
I personally admire Basim's courage. The events made his life difficult.
I understand why he is angry. I could never imagine going through what he has overcome.
It was clear to me within the first minute of him speaking. He is an above average intelligent person.
It is appropriate to say that it is the responsibility of the United States to do more. After they essentially destroyed his life.
All we are shown are war zones, mass destruction, lifeless bodies in blown up streets, and ash and blood covered citizens.
A lot of the time the news shows only the bad parts of the Middle East. The news makes everyday Americans ignorant to what life is really like.
I know many people that don't even know the middle east even has shopping malls, colleges, parks, and nice manicured lawns.
The news would never show an American Military screw up. The news is too busy portraying us as heroes.
Those who are to blame are those who lead us.
If only they knew that we were in no danger to begin with and the battle is fought just because of our economic interest, I am sure many would not be in the army today.
Its a horrible byproduct of war that feeds and often times creates prejudice. Though the majority of those people are normal civilians, just like us.
I have nothing but the upmost respect for Basim after getting the chance to speak to him.
Understandably, when you live with war for nearly a decade it is easy to feel like all hope is lost.
Back to my original question. How can we fix this broken system?
Would civilians be safe? That was a situation that Basin experienced.
I also agree that Bassim is an incredibly man.
To experience what he has experienced and not have hate for America is truly inspiring.
everyone took more time to see a persons beliefs are not reflective of their government there would be less conflict in the world
We met Basim Razzo. he is such a kind hearted, forgiving person. Basim made all of us feel his pain and loss. he told his story of how his home was bombed and several of his loved ones were killed
When we think about something remotely similar happening to us, we tend to get very angry. I was disgusted. I felt for him immensely while listening to his heartbreaking story. He had such a grace in explaining himself.
I loved his response. It made me think about how sometimes I overreact about small things that dont even affect me in a big way. He is able to forgive. He is able to continue to love. even after things that were so important to him we just ripped from his life.
I feel like we can take some knowledge from his religion. We turn our hate into love and understand. being able to forgive those who mistreated you is better than hating them and having anger towards them.
After hearing him speak, I want to take the knowledge and outlook that he has and incorporate it into my life as well.
In other terms of integration I feel there needs to be further acceptance of cultural differences socially by individuals
I know that I would probably never have the courage to do something so incredible. I really admire that about Bassim, as well.
I also really liked how you brought up an example of how some Americans tend to not have as much compassion for others as Bassim does.
It seemed like it was justified. America should have gone into Afghanistan. America went to find the terrorist group responsible for the attacks on 9 11.
It was really a pivotal moment in history. The culture of the United States changed. The culture was focused on preventing any other attack on the homeland. We were preparing for war in other countries.
The invasion of the United States to go into Iraq was really to acquire their oil. They didn't focus on the interests of the Iraqi people.
With the story of Bassim Razzo, I think Sam wanted to remind us that the people's countries that we had invaded into are people just like us.
The fact the the errant bomb by the United States government which landed on Bassim's property did not even make the front page of the Times really shocked me.
The thing that most brought this point to bear. what happened to the man speaking in this video?
An Iraqi man who was educated and lived in the United States, house was bombed by collation forces during the war against ISIS.
The attack claimed many members of this mans family including his wife. She was several feet away from him.
He recently returned to Iraq to work. He still lives with the ghost of the incident.
He said that there was no difference between Bush, Obama, and Trump. It was seen in they were handling the problems that face everyday people in Iraq
He specifically said that the biggest problem was the corruption of the politicians throughout the country.
To me this speaks volumes to an often-forgotten part of war, in any war, the rebuilding. The effect it has on the people who live there.
I am not well informed at all on the Middle East. It is my own fault. The most I ever hear about that area has to do with war.
What I hear is typically surrounded by some sort of negative stigma as well.
Sam introduces Ahmad Rafi along Arghawan. Which creates a real feeling surrounding the topic.
Rafi is introduced. He tells how he unfortunately was born into the conflict zone that is Afghanistan.
His normal life is certainly not anything compared to a normal life that we live here.
It is something I would not ever be able to imagine.
Rafi stresses to work for the peace. That is definitely something you hear of more often lately.
It is so much easier said than done. I believe in practicing what you preach.
I am not the most fully informed person when it comes to war. This lecture left me thinking and remembering.
I agree with you about knowledge. Knowledge is learned in more ways than finding out from a textbook.
Bassim truly has a heart. He should be a role model for all those who have experienced loss due to war.
The fact that he is able to turn his tragedy and grief into a lesson for others instead of hate is truly amazing.
It makes me so upset the way the media society in general twists our view of what a culture and country is truly like. to make our country seem so much better than someone's across the world.
This strips a country filled with beautiful people of their true identity. This slaps on a label that makes them seem as a lesser than.
Could you imagine how amazing the world would be. We started treating others the same way we wish others treated us?
We dont always have the opportunity to see the war from people. Who are living in the actual warzone.
However, Basim was able to find peace after losing almost everything through Islam.
I find it interesting how religion can be used as a tool. It can be used as an instrument of violence. ISIS is using it to create a new caliphate. It can be used as an instrument of peace. such as Basim using it to forgive those who harmed him.
I think Merve has a great point. She brings up how Sam helps us view people as human beings. We don't judge them by culture, religion, sexuality.
Basim is a part of a society where the American citizens do not spend as much time on as they should.
Specifically, I lived in Texas for several years as a kid. In that time I took TWO full years of Texas History.
We came to the conclusion that no, it wasn't, but it is responsible for teaching us about different perspectives and different people, which it generally just does not do.
I agree that our isolationist attitude really isn't the American people's fault.
However, it is our responsibility to demand change.
Being able to hear someone speak that experiences war every day.
This is something I am guilty of myself.
I am not aware of what people experience on a personal level.
Most of the time we almost do not realize the huge impact it has on people's lives.
I asked myself what we could do to stop this situation. The conclusion was, students, cannot do much about it other than recognizing the problem and spreading awareness.
Because of his ability to understand this and make the adjustments. He now lives a life free of resent towards Americans in particular.
the experience Bassim went through is extremely tragic and painful. he was able to look past the anger and realize that it was only hurting himself.
understanding that anger solely restricts us. Anger opens new doors, experiences, opportunities will all open up.
Bassim never rid himself of the anger. bassim would not have been able to look at myself. Americans are good people. thea whole country is excluded from his liking because of his internal anger.
Through this course, I am slowly starting to realize just how inhumane white people were in the past. This is something that I really had trouble visualizing previously.
I also found your point that things were not all rainbows and butterflies to be very humorous. It is also a fitting description of how I was taught history in lower level education.
I know it may be heard for us white people to hear how racists we really were. Through the role reversal demonstration with African American people telling history as if they were the superior race.
It is a mind-blowing idea. We can truly see then how the way we view other countries might be the same as how they view our country.
Sociology 119 is a class that every student in college should take. Sociology 119 opens their minds to allow people to change their perspective and accept others.
Sam speaks about how there is an Islamic-phobia. the media conveys that Muslims have been killing because of their religion.
There is a big difference between Muslims and extremists who kill for Islam.
The Islamic religion actually preaches for love, tolerance, and freedom of religion. Somehow Islamic extremists changed what the Quran had hoped to sermonize.
I never heard that hating someone in general is tolerable.
In our small group last week. This lesson hit home .
I have gone through a fair amount of emotional distress in the fallout of my parents' divorce.
Life has had a crazy way of teaching me the right lessons at exactly the right time. That notion seems so far from truth in the moment.
It doesn't matter how difficult the trials may be. I keep moving forward.
He's somehow been able to accept that and make the most of his life despite an unthinkable tragedy that clearly could have been prevented.
He has gone through such extreme tragedies. No person should be even relatively okay after.
Basim is doing okay. Bassim is living his life to the fullest.
His religion tells him to forgive. He uses his religion to guide him through life.
The video starts with Sam discussing how the class is always changing. This is very important. As the world changes, education must too.
It is very true that we do not talk about christian killings. Christian killings are occurring throughout the world.
You want people to see you in one way, Make sure to see them the same way as well.
This is a concept that seems very basic. This concept is forgotten in todays world. This contributes to islamaphobia.
In everyday life if we start looking for justice and fairness in how we discuss events We will be able to see that Muslims and Christians are not that different at all.
Obviously Basim cares so much about his family. When telling his story I think a lot of the audience was angry for him.
What really stuck with me was how he does not hold any resentment toward Americans. Even though the tragedy he endured was caused by America, he knows that not all Americans are so careless
He lived in the US for several years. He got to know Americans as people. Not one huge stereotype or outlet for his anger. Which is a lesson I think we can all learn from.
people should follow Basims example. people should move past anger in order to better themselves. There are a lot of problems in this country. The world would be solved a lot faster than the current rate.
The people I knew in my life were outwardly religious. They were the ones who were blatantly going against teachings in the bible itself.
I think that its used as a guideline. All of them were written so many years ago. They can even be outdated.
Bassims story was truly heartbreaking. It was encouraging at the same time.
I definitely feel like that is something that everyone should learn to live by.
Personally, I always try to forgive people who had done something bad to me. I do not hold a grudge against them. It makes me feel. I am giving that other person power by letting them affect my emotions.
This obviously isnt an easy thing to do. Situations may vary from person to person. It is not everyday that we hear about stories similar to Bassims in our everyday lives.
This made me wonder if we as Americans still have grief towards that tragic event, I couldnt even imagine how it would feel to have the same fear everyday.
Being a White Christian male, it made me realize that it is easy to condemn and bash other groups. It is a lot harder to see the faults in the group I identify with most.
I appreciate that this class is conducted differently every semester.
Immigrants like me tend to overlook the atrocities. My American government inflicts on my Muslim brothers and sisters around the world.
They are in line with the mentality. ideology of radical Americans carry out the governments agenda. There will always be fear in minorities immigrants.
Without dramatic measures, immigrants like my family who have worked hard and surpassed the average American family will always feel threatened by those under our financial status due to the lack of support from our government.
Mentioning the word status shows a lack of acceptance for humans. I still believe that financial domination would prove a sense of superiority.
I think this class has been very helpful in getting me to open my eyes to new perspectives. I had never thought about it before.
Coming from a very white neighborhood myself, I can feel overwhelmed at times. I have never had people challenge my viewpoints. I have never had people challenge my opinions.
To be honest, people never really got into talking about controversial topics. his class is like a huge wake up call to me.
I think it makes everything more personable and relatable in a way.
Sam started off class by addressing the day being 9 11.
I did not understand the meaning of this business. It was brought up that the military ensuring the safety and well being of our country also means getting important resources.
The question Sam repeated was how would I feel if this happened to me. how would I feel if my resources taken away, close lives gone, everything gone.
I was not actually in the same situation. These questions allowed to me gain the perspective.
In the following video when we actually spoke with Bassim, I was heartbroken.
He was no longer angry of what we did.
That was something I could not relate to. I would be furious.
SO many people go to church as a Catholic or Christian. However, they end up doing things that could prevent them from going to heaven.
I knew you weren't allowed to participate in same sex activities. To think Saddamy was against the bible is strange.
Its happening right now with all of this White Supremacy stuff going around.
From this class and particular question I thought something. Something was very interesting.
We were taking into perspective someone else's views.
Anger is an emotion that all us as humans experience.
Basim said that he was angry for a few months at the U.S.
It makes sense to me for him to be angry at the U.S. for what they did and are doing.
Basim did not let this emotion swallow his morals and virtues.
Being angry at the entire group for an excessive amount of time is tiring. It can really take a toll on someone.
Basim was being angry all the time. He was becoming restless, sick, started having pains in his body. He wasn't feeling well.
Not everyone is a dangerous person. Not everyone wants to take advantage of other people.
Basim said it in the video. He came to america.
Basim learned that not everyone is a racist. Even a person that wants nothing more than to cause pain.
In this clip a student asks if president changes have had any impact on Iraq.
we can do as much as we can to help a problem we possibly have worsened. there is a limit to how much we can do to help with problem.
He does say some things have gotten better. He doesn't seem to have much hope for the future.
The fact that nothing has changed from 2003.
We must we contribute knowledge. We should give private citizens money to rebuilt what has been destroyed by our errors.
ISIS came in and began to change the lives of those living in Iraq. We are forced to ask ourselves if the country could ever recover.
War is one thing. Countries have been able to recover from devastating wars. It is incredibly difficult to come back from an entire culture being wiped out and replaced by another.
No internet, no digital televisions, ISIS took it all away. They assumed control of Iraq. What ISIS did was not how things should turn out.
As for if the country could return to how it once was it is impossible to say at this point if it will go back to where it was.
The United States government has been involved since 2003.
None of the three leaders we have had since the start have been able to put an end to the bloodshed. Before the people of Iraq could even hope to return to the lifestyle they led before, the war would have to come to a conclusion first. With tensions rising, when that end comes could certainly determine if the country can rebound from ISIS. With tensions rising, when that end comes could certainly determine if the country can rebound from the war.
I feel as though we only know what we hear on the media about these places. I view these places as the enemy. it is just one little group who we are in war with.
I was surprised that he was not angry at the Americans for the bombing. If it was to happen to me I think I would be.
He is very strong and logical. if he stayed angry, the anger would just eat the insides of him. there is no way to live life or even move on at all.
From this it is important to remember that there are innocent people that have been blamed for doing nothing. They have been majorly affected by this conflict.
I enjoyed this class so much. I also talked about it here in the discussion.
Something needs to be done. The people's perspective has to change.
When I came to class that day, I was tired and unfocused. once I found out what the topic was and how this man was, I could not have been more aware and alert.
Forgiveness is the most powerful tool. Seeing Basim put that into action makes me want to live my life to be more like that as well. If someone can forgive something that awful, everyone should be able to forgive.
However, there was something special about the way that he introduced Basim. It made every phone screen in the audience dark. Not a cough to be heard.
There are almost no differences.
Basims life was turned upside down. His house was accidentally bombed by Americans.
I know. Personally, my heart dropped.
I thought he was similar to me. How could he be?
I thought about how my life would have changed if I were Basim. I had trouble just processing it.
His face was in front of mine. My empathy was through the roof.
Problem I was having suddenly felt so small.
I greatly admire him for having the courage to speak about the incident in front of so many people on a livestream.
My father passed when I was in 7th grade. I still have trouble talking about it without getting teary eyed.
He said that it did nothing good to him to be angry. He cannot change that something.
Bassim explains that he came to America for 8 years and he saw nothing but kindness from the people here.
I enjoyed living in America. I never thought about our government being a big problem.
I heard Bassim talk about what they did to his family It made me look at our government in a different way than I did before.
I have so much respect for the way Bassim looks at his life.
The US people get caught up in we should be the world's police. The other foreign policy.
Naturally, as Americans, we believe we see vast differences between the foreign policies between George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump.
They all had have the same goal to bring stability in the Middle East.
Obama exacerbated this corruption by pulling troops out of Iraq. Obama left a vacuum of power that was filled by ISIS.
The general who spent tours in Afghanistan. He spoke at one of our lectures discussed rules of engagement in war.
I have always thought about this. I was never able to understand it. In this talk I fully understood the reason of the US government entering Iraq.
This is something to praise.
The United States hasnt been helping the middle east in some aspects and it shows in everything that Bassam has told us in class.
The United States has helped a tremendous amount in the middle east. Many changes cannot be felt to the civilians like Bassam. In some instances the United States has made things much much worse.
I never really thought about the people who were actually affected. I never really thought about their families, or their feelings.
I loved how he spoke about his religion. How it taught him to forgive.
I really respected him. He explained that he does not hate Americans. He explained how he has American friends. He explained how he is upset with the government, not civilians.
I feel honored. I was able to hear his story.
The sooner we open up the borders that we construct for ourselves around the rest of the world, the sooner we can start to experience everything the world has to offer.
I know he wasnt looking for sympathy. I couldnt help but feel for this man.
These people flipped his life upside down. These people were the cause of losing the things he loved.
How can you not hate someone who made you lose all of that?
This man has been through much. I couldnt help but feel it was all of our fault.
He has come to terms with it. he has learned to forgive. I think thats the most admirable thing Ive ever heard.
My heart was breaking in this class. I learned a lot about the power of forgiveness.
He asked that we all become more aware of the life that exists outside of what were used to, or what we call home.
We often listen to what is being thrown at us. We are sometimes forgetting to further research and then form our own opinions on the matter.
In my high school, we were required to take 3 years of different US History courses. We were never given the option to take courses that covered the history of other countries.
I do not think that Bassim way of thinking is rare.
Sit there. Ask yourself this questions.
we have our oil? Saddam Hussain is a good man?
Ordinary people like Bassim do not care who their leader is. They are fine as long as they can feed their families and they are safe.
He was the victim of a horrible tragedy that cost him the lives of his family members. He was able to find the strength to move on.
This is why a price tag cannot be put on lives. It greatly diminishes their value.
Though no one will ever know whether it was simply luck, fate, or divine intervention that kept Bassim alive. I believe that he will inspire others so that in the future, a tragedy like this can be avoided
For somebody to endure what Bassim has gone through and still not hold any anger or hate inside of him is amazing.
Just trying to imagine a similar situation. It would leave many people looking for ways to exact some sort of retaliation against those who have harmed them.
I hope that Bassim continues to find happiness in his life. He can use his story to influence others.
Rafi is definitely a very brave man for standing for what he believes even It goes against barbaric people such as the Taliban.
Listening to Rafi is inspirational. It shows his determination .
It is important to learn more about issues from all over the globe. You need to listen to different perspectives on each individual issue. You can formulate your own individual opinion of the subject.
I do believe that education is the greatest tool to change the world properly. we should be educated about all subjects. we should encourage learning to engage in a battle of arguments. we should not encourage a battle of weapons .
I feel the exact same way each every Soc 119 class I walk into. Not knowing what to expect.
He has made it clear just how important it is to not let anger restrict us. This is quality that will and should be carried along with all of us through life as a lesson to live by.
He has had so much taken from him for no reason. He's still able to say he has no hate in his heart towards us Americans.
Its how I view bullying in a way. you are be a bigger person to face it. you let the bully turn you into a bully yourself.
Hearing Basimsstory firsthand was unlike anything Ive experienced before
And on our parts we need to be more awake when watching the news. we should realize that there are people with families. those live on the other side of those bombs we see on tv.
Extremist groups in the Middle East are giving muslims a bad reputation. They attack innocent people in the name of Islam. But we should not be blaming the attacks on all Muslims.
He had lost his family. He had come to peace with everything that had happened to him.
To be able to live on in a positive way that something that is special and what really separates him from a the average person.
In this video, he mentions that his lecture material often changes due to economic and problem around the society.
I agree that there should be no body of knowledge that holds a believe about the general problem such as racial and gender problems
I think this is important idea. having a body of knowledge about somethings might prevent us to think farther and understanding other ideas.
He mentions that he talks about Islam a lot. He is trying to make people more comfortable about the Muslim.
We have a problem about thinking that only Muslim is a problem.
We need to think about what happened before.
We cant generalize about the Muslim in general just by looking at people who commit terror and killing that is going on these days.
I really enjoyed. It was fun having class while facetiming Basim.
In the video, a student asked what changes in their country occurred when ISIS came intro Iraq.
Bosim said they completely changed their way of life.
Its crazy to think about how much power ISIS holds. It makes me wonder when this will all stop. It makes me wonder if anything could be done to end the constant terror and fear.
Iraq is many people's home. It is unfortunate that they have to live the way that they do.
Everyone wants their family to have a good life. Everyone deserves to be able to give their family that.
You brought up some really interesting ideas. They added to that class' particular discussion for me.
First off, I think your point about not letting a skinny book dictate one's life too much.
We can begin shining a bigger light on the hypocrisy of Christian Sharia in America. That would go a long way in improving race ethnic relations.
individuals, myself included, the media, take a more open-minded stance on things we don't know. this country begin to make lasting progress in this arena.
he video chat with Bassim was I think the most honest. The video chat with Bassim was eye opening class I have been to.
They think about us. We need to start thinking of them in the same ways.
First, the chance to get hear from someone that has been negatively impacted. Hearing that is something that is really eye opening.
To hear about losing his parts of his family by something we did. something we did is truly sickening.
It had even more of an impact on me when Sam opened up the conversation for questions.
What happened to his family was tragic. It is arguably reasonable to be angry at the country that caused it.
Forgiveness is something that I believe helps heal even the deepest of wounds.
Its easy to blame an entire country for their governments actions. Look beyond what everyone thinks is the answer to see that everyone is different is key.
We come from all walks of life like he mentions in the video. it can be hard to look past our actions to really see that who we really are.
His outlook on forgiveness really makes me think about how I choose to react to negative events in my life.
I can not think of something that I am that passionate about.
I dont know many people who are that passionate about anything.
it is the concept of money. money prevents this passion for certain subjects.
It is hard to live in a world where money is important. pursue something that doesnt make money like trying to instill peace.
I was amazed that a man that with stood amazing pain and loss could not be angry with the United States. Especially after the response given by the authorities and minute compensation
Most who are interviewed or retell their story often talk out the grace and protection of God. the grace and protection of God helped them through tough times.
But for those who firmly deny the existence of a higher being how do they cope with the experience.
I wonder. How many who are religious have done the opposite under the same circumstances?
My guess would be more of the former than the latter, but people in the latter are often less inclined to admit it than the former.
Basim easily hate America. what happened to his family?
He could easily be filled with hate every day of his life.
At first, this seems impossible. You nearly everything you love taken away from you. You still to find happiness in life.
But my aunts strength has shown me that it is possible to continue on after such a tragedy.
The death of his wife, daughter, brother, and nephew has left an eternal bruise on his heart. Basim has found acceptance and forgiveness within him.
He is an extremely kind-hearted man. The man elicits an impressive amount of courage. This is why I am extremely grateful to have had the opportunity to witness this conversation with him.
I am very surprised that he was not upset with the United States. Quite frankly, I was at that point.
Not only that. They tried sweeping the problem under the carpet by not making a huge deal out of it. They gave the survivors an embarrassingly low amount of money. They gave them a demoralizing amount of money.
I have never heard any stories about the impact of our military other than what you hear in the media. It is generally positive.
The passages that were chosen were more violent then often associated with these texts. The people on the streets often chose to link the violent passages to the Quran claiming that it was more violent than the Bible.
I know some of the more popular stories. My familiarity with the Bible is limited.
I do understand. Much of what is said in the Bible is of the time is was written.
They only follow the parts that will benefit their lives and that coincide with their beliefs.
This is a dangerous way of making guidelines for ones life.
Life is more complicated then thou shalt not kill because what about self defense?
There are so many ideas that are outdated, for example stoning people for punishment.
But even so, people will pick and chose which is dangerous.
He isn't mad at Americans. That is what happened.
He didn't generalize the people of the country for what the people of their government did to him.
The roles had been reversed. Many Americans would have not found it in their hearts to forgive anyone.
All we hear on the news these days is how Trump is offended by certain individuals not respecting his way of ruling. All we hear is certain celebrities being pregnant. We hear really small things that we shouldn't care about but are projected.
This prevents us from finding about the truth about our country. the actually news we should be focusing on like how our government bombed Bassim's house.
We are not the greatest country. The fact that many Americans think that we are is horrifying.
Countless atrocities occurred in the past. No justice has been delivered.
Would people really agree to these wars? Did they know how many civilians were slaughtered?
We are free. How do we have the highest incarceration rate in the world?
I liked the speech that he give to the class. It made me think.
I am really looking forward. What will be coming after?
It is shameful that we have evolved to empathize for those who are close to us. We are so quick to falsely judge those far from us. We judge based off a few acts out of a fraction of a percent of Muslims.
He said he was numb for a couple of months after his wife died. For the next two months, he was very angry.
But then he realized that the anger was eating him from inside.
Being angry at something that has already happened. Being angry will definitely not make you happy.
People make mistakes but it is up to individuals like us to decide whether or not to forgive.
He also says that the governments were responsible for whatever happened to him and not the people.
It is the people. They managed to stay the same.
My first impression was amazement. It was easy for the entire class to communicate. It was easy for the entire class to ask Bassim questions. It was easy regardless of the fact he is thousands of miles away in Afghanistan.
In a practical sense, it is nearly impossible for one to live such a life. They follow all the ideals and laws of God 100% of the time.
It is the desire of most people to find meaning in their life. They embrace a universal plan based on the nature of love and goodness.
One of the videos that really grabbed my attention was Radicalizing the Bible.
The Quran and Bible are similar. If the Bible was used to convey laws we would have many of the same problems and conflicts that Muslims, especially overseas, face
Its seems crazy that the main thing that separates normal Muslims and groups like ISIS comes down to interpretation of the Quran.
Whos to say if the Bible was used to in a Sharia Law type use that we wouldnt have radical groups emerge.
This is only one problem. Many similar would emerge.
The topics were subjective like alcohol use, premarital sex, altruism, abortion, killing in self defense. Sam mentioned all of them in class.
Laws are cut and dry. Black and white is what offers clarity and lack of ambiguity.
If the Bible was used for Sharia Law I feel there would be a lack of our unique opinions
I feel Americans live in their own little bubble. They do not see the horrific events that happen outside of it.
Americans understand that a war is going on. I believe. They do not know. It affects people just like them.
People in Afghanistan are dying every day but the media never allows us to hear about it
Basims life was flipped upside down. United States bombed his house. It killed his wife, daughter, brother, nephew, and dog.
I believe you can grasp the pain that war causes by walking in the shoes of another person who experiences it.
We hear death toll numbers all the time. Death toll numbers are just numbers.
For me, Bassims talk with us helped me to turn all those facts and figures I hear into people and places.
I think we can take a life lesson from Bassim in not being so filled with hatred.
I admired Bassims. Bassim way of placing blame.
he knew the source of the act came from our government. he blames our government.
This was such a thought provoking answer to me. s a Christian, I was thinking about how I would personally react to this situation.
I feel as though frustration mixed with determination to produce the ideal result. Frustrations at an institution, rather than individuals, yields better results if one is hoping to bring about change in the system.
I think today it is hard to change people's beliefs. We all grow up with them.
You say without the ability to accept difference. People will never understand each other fully.
People need to accept that not everyone is the same. If we can't do this, then we won't understand each other.
Sam said that if this was said in difference societies or if the religion where substituted for Jew or Muslim, the backlash would be so much greater. its really the desensitization of the public to statements like this in society that are really frightening especially when these politicians run the direction of the country.
t Basim advised us to do is really important. one could only wish that these videos of Basim speaking could go viral.
It should become a requirement. While its not we then have to do further research ourselves. We have to not take the medias word on every little thing.
I couldnt ever imagine experiencing something even close to what Bassim had gone through.
In my opinion there is no monetary value that could make me just want to move on from a tragic event. Like in the case of Bassim.
I completely agree to your point. This is distortion in the way we see others.
Theres this saying that when you point a finger at someone, there are three other fingers pointing back at yourself.
When religions and other races choose to point the finger, they never acknowledge that this is happening in their group too.
It may not make a big difference right away, but it certainly could help some.
It really helps to hear how other perspectives feel because then we see this challenge of our beliefs being the end all be all way and potentially see how others see it.
By having such conversations, these beliefs can hopefully start to break down this way. The way we've chosen to live by for so long.
I remember listening to him in class talk about his wife and daughter being killed. I couldnt get this idea out of my head for quite some time.
I just thought it was strange. it didnt register as to how bad it that would genuinely destroy me inside and out.
Maybe at the time it was really just a lot of information. I not only wasnt prepared for but had no prior interest at all in regretfully, but without even him mentioning it. It somehow flipped a switch in my head that really brought me to a saddened train of thought.
hey really like to bring a heavy focus on what's bad. They conveniently forget to add the good parts.
Growing up I always thought people from the middle east didn't care about Americans. middle east didn't care about Americans from how things were portrayed on the news.
I discovered this was wrong. I met one of my current best friends.
We really have to question the things we hear. We need to find out for ourselves.
I thought it was cool to hear from someone who was directly affected by the war. He has many stories to tell.
Basim mentioned how ISIS entered Mosul. ISIS started converting Mosul to something that it was not before.
Basim left Mosul when his house was bombed and he lost everything.
The images shown while Basim was speaking showed what the city of Mosul used to look like, and what the city looks like now.
The media simply does not report all of the terrible things that happen. It makes me reconsider how we get our information.
I loved hearing everything Basim talked about. I look forward to listening to more speakers in the future.
I cant even imagine what these people go through. all of the things they must have to sacrifice for their families or even just themselves.
Rafi telling his story was very touching and inspiring, and I really felt moved by everything he said.
The skill of empathy does not only extend to your family members or neighbors. Empathy extends to those who you would consider to be nothing like you.
As Sam talked about, people are so quick to think of Muslim people as violent and hateful, but fail to realize Christians have done the same things.
I think the reason we are able to overlook the hate and violence from people who identify as Christian is because we also know Christians that do not have the same values as the KKK . n we are able to overlook the hate and violence from other white Christian hate groups.
Therefore there is no difference when it comes to denying the hate groups from each religion to identify as it.
Just because you follow a certain religion, it does not make you a good or bad person.
I do not believe that your religion defines who you are. People should not be discriminated and stereotyped through what they identify with and believe.
This is easier said than done. With more awareness of the similarities with people outside of your own religion, these stereotypes can begin to diminish in social presence.
When I was young I never really put the pieces together. why we were invading Iraq; we werent just invading Iraq because of the recent terrorist attacks on the United States.
We were invading Iraq. We wanted their oil.
Sam explained it this way. It made more sense to me.
In my opinion 9 11 gave the government another reason on top of wanting Iraqi oil to invade Iraq. It may sound shallow but I think that they used 9 11 as an excuse to invade Iraq to get what they really wanted.
Samallowed us to see the war in Iraq. The perspective of those who lived in Iraq.
This was very interesting for me. I never really understood the life that people were able to live while this huge war was going on right in their front yard. I never really understood how they felt about the United States invading Iraq.
When you think about it from their perspective and not our own it makes sense as to why they were angry.
When I thought about it like this it made me feel angry. I too would be angry if another country invaded the U.S. to take our resources, its not fair.
This is when Sam described that there are really two main uses of the military. One is to protect. The other is to do business.
When we invaded Iraq thats just what we were doing using our military to retaliate against 9 11 and we were using it to make money by stealing Iraqi oil.
our peer asked the question about his feelings towards us. I was not expecting the answer he gave.
If I were to ever be in the same position as Basim, I do not think I would have forgiven the other country.
He has every right to be furious towards us and I felt so ashamed of what we did to him.
I admire your comment about if more people were to be more like Basim. If more people were like Bassim, we would all live in a better, more peaceful place.
We all have something we always wear no matter what. It makes us feel complete.
thinking of it that way made total sense
It was so inspiring to see, when the girls tried the hijabs on they actually felt something very unexpected.
We need to make these conversations happen more, we all assume but never go straight to the person who we make assumptions about.
I admire them so much for that. I am thankful we all got the opportunity to hear their opinion.
One of the girls said she wears it proudly. Men have some traditions to abide by as well.
I wish some days I could just tell myself that the outside really isnt that important. modesty should come within.
No matter how much you cover. the personality wont be affected. thinking wont be affected.
I agree with your reply and also think it is really cool to see how Sam and Bassim can communicate using technology.
Being able for them to stay in touch is so amazing and a really cool teaching experience for Sam
The idea is really cool because it is allowing you to make a connection with someone from a completely different background and culture.
You can share different stories. explain what goes on in the part of the world where you are writing from.
I also agree with your point on how it benefitting us. we can understand what is going on in different parts of the world we can understand what is going on where maybe we had an opinion that was wrongfully told to us.
Many of the things he said stood out. I think the most shocking thing he said was an answer to when he was asked why he wasnt angrier with the United States.
He said that he was numb at first. He was angry. He thought that anger would eat him from the inside. The anger was harming him more than it was helping him. so he chose to forgive.
This is such a powerful message that I think is important for anyone to understand.
Not only was his house destroyed, but his wife, daughter and brother were killed as well, and he chose to forgive.
I cant even fathom how I would react if I was in that situation. I definitely would not forgive the country who killed my family.
Forgiveness is hard. People should begin to learn to forgive others. The world would be a better place in my opinion.
Its hard for me to talk on this matter because in my life I have not really lost anyone super important to me.
Basim said that he was numb. I felt an emotion change inside of me.
I think the part of this video that struck me the most was when Basim said that anger was eating him up. Basim he needed to move on.
Wouldnt it be nice if every country just left each other alone.
Most people around the world believe in forgiveness. That’s what their religion teaches them.
I'm not a religious person myself. I really liked hearing about how similar the Muslim religion is compared to the Christian religion.
I dont think there is ever such thing as being a perfect Christian. I dont think there is ever such thing as being a perfect Muslim. everyone interprets their religions in their own way.
You are doing what you think is right. You are living a good life.
He easily could live the rest of his life with complete hatred towards the United States. The US Army destroyed his home and killed off most of his family. The fact that he doesn't hate shows how mentally strong Basim is and his character as a man.
He says that his anger rests with the governments involved in this conflict. It is completely understandable.
I'm not going to tell Basim how to live his life. I think he should have some anger about what happened to him.
The admirable part of this is that Basim didn't blindly decide to carry out a long-term grudge towards every American citizen. they helped him out in a major time of need, so the least he can do is reward them with his respect as humans.
I was more shocked that not everyone realized this. Its so disturbing that we have to take a class in order to understand the importance of another human being.
What Bassim said was absolutely true.
Bassim mentioned how he feels that in America we arent taught enough about geography and other countries which is part of the issue
what do you think about teaching other countries in school? will it make a difference?
How can we get people to actually care?
I do really think we need to start.
And if so, how do they do this?
This shouldnt have to be the case but it is.
We should also care about the daily lives of the people who live there.
I agree with your idea about we have to find a common ground between other culture and my culture. Understanding cultures will make it easier to relate.
It is very hard to us. relating to things that we are not familiar with.
We need to learn more about the things that we dont recognize.
We can be more open and get more comfortable with the people. Muslim talk about them more and encounter them more.
What I am trying to get across here is that experience matters a lot.
I am really glad that in our classroom we get to talk about Muslim. Through discussing their culture and their society, the idea of them changed a lot.
I Met someone from Iraq, who has had an attack made on his family. the conflict over in Iraq seem more real
This is the reason. That is why I chose this clip.
My immediate first question for Bassim was how does he deal with any resentment or anger he might have.
I know that if I were to lose nearly my entire family, I would sink into a depression, or be overly angry with the world, not just the government.
During that response, I tweeted on the soc119 hashtag How does one continue after something like a bomb?
Knowing also, after watching this clips, that Bassim accredits his forgiveness to his religion.
This type of teaching is common. Most associate it with extremist Islam.
You chose to ignore teachings of love. Bassim has learned that you have your own opinions of what the religion has to be.
Maybe the only thing we need is to forgive.
My response is to the video of Basim Razzo when he said he was not angry with America.
He needed to forgive. He needed it to be able to live his life.
Many people in America condemn the Islamic religion. It is their ignorance that makes them feel this way.
I too loved the comparison. Sam made comparisons between the new testament and the bible.
He discusses many of the similarities between the faith's and the things they call for.
People will always scoff like that kid behind you did. It is difficult to accept that you may be like the very people you speak negatively about.
It is this refusal to accept blame that causes even more issues. It makes the problem bigger.
I first saw. He was very calm. He sounded and looked a little sad.
He spoke very fondly of his daughter. He spoke very fondly of his wife was nice to hear him speaking fondly of them.
He said that forgiveness was something that he had to do for himself and because of his religion.
In Islam, it is a big thing to be able to forgive people for wrongs that have done to you.
Basim wasn't angry with Americans but he does realize that there is a problem within the US government.
His ability to differentiate the two was impressive to me. I would think most people would automatically couple the two.
Basim continues to live his life. He knows that time waits for no one.
Some of hisfamily was taken from him too soon but he said he realizes he has his son and his daughter-in-law.
So, he believes that he can't live in the past and has to keep moving to be able to actually live a fulfilled life
I am equally as disappointed in the hatred our human race has for each other as you are.
I cannot act as though I am innocent in all of this.
In many cases people have taken it to an extreme. Some cannot simply look at another without mentally pointing out differences and imperfections.
Im sure we can all think of someone. someone hands out more insults than they do compliments.
I think people like this are worsening our progression to a more accepting society.
It is wrong to judge people based on their race. Our society must recognize that all races are capable of good, not just bad.
It happens in America. We need more of an emphasis on this. All the stereotypes our media has given to the Afghan people.
That being said, it is common for people who obtain jobs in the city to move to my home town to start families and commute to work on the local train.
Therefore, I had a lot of friends who had parents that worked work there.
Shortly after, they realized that. we were just a mile , two across the water, that were may not be safe.
We packed up. We left.
A lot of the comments, responses, or questions that you heard from the oppressed whites are statements that echo the feelings and mindset of many African Americans in the United States.
You likely did not grow up hearing these opinions or thoughts around you so that is why it was difficult for you to understand.
This was inspiring and so respectful. We have someone who lost almost everything to even give us students the time of day and to say hes not angry with us
I thought it was incredible for him to acknowledge that some of us may be unaware or uninformed about some things he deals with all the time, but in a nonjudgmental way.
So it was nice to have someone say hey be more aware but without any anger or resentment.
Overall, to have someone who should have so much anger towards us tell us kindly to be more aware inspires me to listen.
I walked around with this thought in my head that America is one of the greatest countries on Earth and that essentially we couldn't do wrong.
Hearing this lecture was very interesting. Hearing this lecture was eye opening for me. though I never found my family to be outwardly racist, I realized that I was taught to not speak about it or question issues.
I think seeing it in such a different light was really important. I believed in how racism isn't real but I needed to see the statistics to know what is really going on in the world.
It was frightening to me. I was taught things that I blatantly did not believe.
growing up in the society we are in now, we all know that there are problems. The only way to fix it is to come together.
I know that racism is still very prominent in our society but I was never exposed to the statistics of it being that bad.
I think. That is a problem that everyone has.
They are all very much republican. They are very near sighted. It comes to seeing what is really there.
His daughter, brother and wife were killed. His family died when the American government bombed his house as well as his brothers house.
I remember tearing the entire time he spoke.
He shared how difficult the times have been. how he turns to faith for hope .
His story was moving. His story truly does make you want to personally invest time in broadening your awareness to international affairs. They affect normal families too.
I cannot believe how positive he was today. He lost almost everything he had in his life.
Basim said, life goes on anyway. Why should I stay angry the rest of my life? He forgave.
I was baptized christian as a baby. i grew up going to Catholic Churches.
It never really grew on me and my dad's side was very hardcore Croatian Catholics and I think they definitely contributed to my lack of interest in christianity or being Catholic.
from this lecture I got to learn a lot more.
Just like Sam said, just because we don't know its happening doesn't mean it isn't.
We see events like a mass school shootings. These white kids who do this are religious. These white kids commit acts of terrorism. Yet we don't label them as terrorists.
It isn't just limited to Muslims. I think we need to start labeling these acts of terrorism. They need to be labeled.
Not just to muslims. To these white kids who are committing acts of hate.
The U.S military had accidentally dropped a missile on his house resulting in the death of his wife, daughter, and dog, in addition to injuring the man.
What truly shocked me about this class was the response that this man had towards this tragedy.
He mentioned how he had been severely depressed and angry. He never thought he would forgive the U.S government for what they had done to him.
He thought that, regardless of the magnitude, humans will always come to a point of progression where they find a way to omit a moment of calamity in their life.
A man lost everything. This was truly impacting.
Furthermore, this person is one of many from the middle east who have suffered from this form of distress as a cause of U.S military attacks; maybe some individuals even worse.
They moved on even with this burden weighing them down. They found a way to forget it. They simply advance in their life.
In the end, to American citizens, it seems like these middle eastern people are the only ones who inflict pain on us and not the other way around. In reality, us Americans have probably done more damage to them.
I thought that at one point he would want to join ISIS. This is for he fact that Americans did that to his home.
Not all the people that were affected by the United Sates bombings feel the same way that Basim does I am sure.
I am positive that some people become so filled with hate. They ultimately end up joining ISIS.
Personally if was in the same situation he was, seeing my wife and pet die before me, I would be filled with anger. I would've probably joined ISIS.
What made the situation even worse is that the United States government only offered 1500 dollars per life.
I feel as if the whole thing from the administration’s point of view is very computerized.
He was just another case that they had to deal with. his family members were just another casualty of war.
It took a lot of him to forgive America. From seeing him through skype I can tell that he has found peace.
He can forgive America for murdering his entire family. We should be able to forgive each other for the little things.
I feel like this lecture has been the most effective to me so far.
This guy graduated from the US. He had such a western culture. All the sudden, during the Iraqi war he lost four of his family members.
Frankly, seeing this guy smiles and laughs with Sam who is American really pushed me forward and gave me a moment to stop and think for a moment about the world.
Basim's words were quite remarkable. He was asked about what keeps him going.
He said you have to keep living which tells you how he had tried desperately to get justice. refund the damages, but without an outcome.
This taught me the lesson. if I really want to see the world a better place, then I have to consider that the cost of my wife's life is the same as my neighbor's or another person we are equal and %99 the same.
Living in America my whole life and having no one in my close family or friend groups that had served. I have never been directly affected by the tragedies of war.
No one would ever address the casualties. No one would ever humanize the people who were being affected
I think the realization of its a real place with real people gives a whole new perspective on war. If everyone could see, there would be no need for violence.
It is a shame because I never really felt unsafe or experienced true fear in America; yet, innocent people just like me across the world lose their lives to war.
Everyone in this world is a human being who should be allowed to dream and not only that should be given a chance to follow those dreams.
What I found most interesting about talking to Bassim was the fact that he was not mad.
If I were him I think I would be mad.
But when he started talking about how he understood that American people are just people and that his feelings toward the disaster that happened to him and his family was directed at politics
That's who I thought of when Sam pulled up the slide titled Christian Sharia.
The Bible says abstinence is the only moral birth control. The law should prohibit schools from handing out condoms.
Why are theyokay while Islamic Sharia is dangerous and evil?
Lawmakers are not basing their morality on a higher power. What are they basing it on?
I always thought people who didn't understand why Church and State should be separate were radical and uneducated, but this part of classmate me flip the script.
Both are small. to quote Sam they do not address all the complexities of life
How are humans qualified to interpret the word of God?
After reading through your and other's responses I think it is pretty clear. Most of us found Basim to be one of if not the most eye opening experiences to take place in our class.
I love what you said about Basim's anger. His forgiveness meant much to you. I had the exact same reaction.
A strong emotion hate rarely accomplishes much. what it does achieve is generally pretty negative?
Over all really insightful response. I like how you ended with how you were inspired with change because I feel like that is Sams whole idea.
Being in the US, we very rarely get first hand accounts. This is what really happens in the middle east.
Usually when we think about the middle east, we think of run down, fully military area, with little commerce.
Basim brought into perspective what Iraq really looks like.
His chilling story gives us an idea of the chaos that has been newly awakened. This is due to recent interventions in the area.
To further this, when asked if he had hope for the future, Basim immediately noted that he did not
It is sad to see. A whole generation will potentially be devastated. A domino effect of actions have taken place in the middle east over the past 15 years.
When this group takes over a city, they embed their religion deep into everyday lives of the people.
This severely reduced the everyday freedoms that people have in the area.
It is almost as if Iraq is not even in control of its own destiny.
This is really where the hopelessness comes from.
It is a feeling of powerlessness that is a result of years of government shifts and instability.
For an American Christian to say Islamic people are only group that have extremists is just a flat out uneducated statement.
To predetermine how someone might behave solely based off of their religion or beliefs is a mistake.
The reality is, regardless of anyones religion or whatever they believe in, you don't know anything about them until you interact with them.
I have grown more interested in Afghanistan. I would definitely like to go there some day.
I also really like how Sam said this class would be all about empathy.
Almost exactly like how people from different areas root for different sports teams.
I would also love to learn more about Buddhism.
They are two cultures that are rooted in very peaceful beliefs. something this current day needs more of.
idk, to me it seems like a pretty easy choice. I get to that point.
he has seen the good in Americans when he studied here It helps him to know that not everyone is like that.
His positivity and outlook is truly something extraordinary, not everyone can handle it the way he does
But, thats exactly why we need more people like Bassim in this world.
We need to realize. A specific a religion or race isnt at fault.
It really is sad to think. The media can manipulate so many people's way of thinking. Finding out the real story takes so much more effort than it should.
The main responsibilities of the media should be to give people the full, correct, unbiased truth of what's going on in the world. It is used as a tool to push agendas and different viewpoints on certain audiences.
Donald Trump (unfortunately) won the election. Clinton won the popular vote. It's clear to see that the media pushing this agenda clearly worked.
this the lesson he ended our lecture with. I think most Americans should take to heart.
A man of a different religion. A man of a different country. He reached out to Sam. He choose to be on screen sharing his experiences with us.
We live in a world full of uniquely different people. it should be our duty as humans sharing this planet to learn more about each other.
With the advent of information age and the wealth of resources available to us as Americans, we are able to be more connected than ever.
To do otherwise would be choosing to remain ignorant.
Never before has the world been so open to us.
We can have more educated dialogues like the one Sam provided. We can move past them.
Bassos experience was so heartbreaking and saddening, I absolutely had no idea how he had the heart in him to forgive.
With more deep thought, I realized it is a lot easier to forgive than have hate.
Anger has the power to control your life in such a negative aspect and no positive change can come from it.
Everyone used their strength to forgive. We could strive to find better understanding. How we can improve our society?
It is very interesting that women have to provide specific reasons as to why they want to get a divorce from their spouse.
There are four different reasons that allows for a divorce. It could be very difficult to find a way out of your marriage for something more simple.
Something so simple here is almost hard to do a place like Afghanistan.
In the United States, we take many things for granted. Those things are difficult to achieve elsewhere.
I agree with what youre saying here Laura.
Being a Christian as well, I understood what Sam was saying too. The Bible could be interpreted in so many different ways. The Sharia could be interpreted in so many different ways.
I do not think people should use the Bible or the Sharia for a law making guide. Some people may interpret each thing differently.
I also thought it was so interesting too what Sam told us about what Mike Pence said.
Not many people reacted to him saying he was first off a Christian and then once Sam compared it to someone saying first off I'm Jewish. It really struck me how out of line it was for him to start off with that.
As well as not to mention in a previous class Sam talked about the exclusion clause so Pence really should not be involving religion in his politics or the government at all.
I think that his response speaks a lot about him as a person, Islam as a religion, and humans as a whole.
No matter who you are it takes a special person to come out of losing their family. not feel anger no matter how long it has been.
Basim must not only be wired to have benevolence. Basim credits the fact that he is a Muslim.
The fact hat we want to be happy and have the ability to forgive is amazing.
I feel it is really important for people to have some empathy. people should get to know what the other person feels and should respect their opinion.
Sometimes a few people are straight up intolerant to other people's opinion, religious beliefs and they try to impose and enforce their ideas on to the other person
Also Sam brought up a point that there are Humans with normal life going on just like the United States.
It was a chilling moment when I came to know that the United States was responsible for killing the family members of Mr.Bassim and their houses.
Sometimes I used to wonder why the United States government used to poke their noses into the issues of other country's internal matters.
In this case, I realise. It is all because of the oil present in the middle east countries.
But the government should also know that millions of people are involved in the matter and many are getting ruined because of this.
Because there are many other people living in the world, but not all of them have the same access to the facilities which you might be receiving.
I thought what you said was really interesting.
I dont have any family members currently serving our country currently. both my grandfathers served.
Americans say they go into war to protect their freedom and those who cant protect their own, but thats not really true.
They help. they have something to gain from helping.
Men and women in America fought literally. Our government wanted to profit from the oil reserves.
It makes me so mad to think about this and all the messed up things that happen in our government.
People say other countries have a corrupt government and that America is so great and has so many opportunities
After hearing Bassims heartbreaking story about the U.S. military bombings that killed his loved ones, I was sad for him.
As hopeless as it sounds, I would be ruined.
Bassim said he realized that being angry did nothing. It made things worse for him.
I feel as though in times like these, its best to have faith. Its best to turn to religion in hopes of finding reason.
I have had experiences in my life when sometimes its easier to sulk and be angry at the world rather than look for a brighter alternative.
However, after hearing Bassims story and his experience, Ive realized that life can be ugly sometimes but it should never stop one from living their life.
If one chooses not to forgive, hate and anger will eat away at them and ruin their life.
The world we live in experiences terrible tragedies. It's time we start to forgive. It's time to hopefully make a change.
Countries do so much to each other, destroying homes, killing family members, but the innocent civilians still have a positive outlook on their life.
It is something very inspiring and something we should all strive to do.
That is something that really stood out to me. a lot of the time we don't think of it in that sense
I praise people like Bassim who witness such horrific events happen. I praise people like Bassim who do not take that out on other people.
Seeing people's reactions in the audience is also very moving.
It makes you think what you could do differently outside of your small little bubble.
It was really important that Bassim did it. It wasn't the American people's fault.
Within those 8 years all he had seen from us Americans. We're good people. The problem he has is with the government.
He uses his religion to guide him through his life.
This is something very interesting to me because here in America, insomepeople's eyes, unfortunately, Muslims are not seen in a positive light.
Nowadays we do a bad job at causing one persons bad actions to change our opinion on that entire group.
I agree with your point that we do not utilize our technology in order to expand our potential of learning about other societies to the extent we should.
It is actions outside of the classroom that must be taken. We need to stay caught up with the world.
Whether it is in communist China where much of the internet is off limits, or America who reports simply what they want their viewers to know.
It was a whole lot of self-incriminating information about Caucasians. We were able to erase their bloody history.
As Sam discussed, it is difficult for many to understand. They are not outside of the hate in the world.
I doubt that in my lifetime I will ever see a country that fully accomplished morality. A country with equality in media information.
Hearing and reading the stories of those who are have struggled is what instills then message in our minds.
I had never put much thought into womens rights in Afghanistan.
But the Saudi women explained that it wasnt oppressive in any way, it is just their religion to cover up in front of men that arent their immediate family.
I can quite understand. He was saying from an experience. I was younger.
It was to a point. I was starting to have negative feelings towards North Koreans.
I did not look into what was actually happening in that country.
I never knew that the citizens were struggling. I did not know the cruelty against them. The cruelty occurred if they wanted to stand up for themselves.
Hearing the stories of escaped North Koreans brought tears to my eyes.
Now we have Trump. He has thought of sending more troops back into the conflict. He is much more concerned with a North Korean nuclear threat.
We entered the conflict because we were provoked.
We took military action. While doing so we attempted to better the lives of the innocent citizens involved.
Id imagine not all the people who have been subject to unbelievable events like Bassim have the same thoughts as him.
LinkTo begin, I thought this particular class was quite emotional.
I cannot even imagine to have a completely normal life one day. Lose almost everything. Everyone that is important.
If I was Bassim I would not be able to go out. It would be all day feeling second hand guilt.
I chose this video in particular. I thought that every word of this advice he gave was valid. It made me realize.
Bassim told us to be aware of people and places that are not the United States.
He also brings up the point. The media in the United States controls everyone.
The thing that shocked me was him saying while he was in England. They knew more about what was going on in the world. Then the American people. It showed the lack of awareness America had had.
I believe this advice was one of the best pieces of advice one could give to college students.
We are the future of America. You have to start small to make something big.
It was horrible. See how much this poor man had endured throughout his life.
He lost his home. He lost the people who meant the world to him.
Everything he lost laid in the hands of the United States government. They were the ones to blame when everything was said and done.
I could never forgive someone who striped everything I had away from me.
It is safe to say that most people would feel the same way I would . Would associate a stigma with all Americans being evil.
He said he had friends that lived in the United States. He's visited. He felt no hard feelings towards them.
He was being angry. He realized how much more that was hurting him.
It was heroic that he forgave because of his religion. He didn't allow something that destroyed him to end the happiness in his life.
The constant battle of things happened in the past. It keeps our world torn and divided.
Each person has his or her own thoughts on the subject. Each person takes a different view.
A reader could now understand something that even the writer had not meant to accomplish.
There are things written in the bible that I agree with. There are things written in the bible that I do not agree with.
The few passages that I strongly like are the ones I try to base my life off.
It is common for humans to only take away the things we want. They only focus on certain parts of things.
That is why there are judges to determine these tricky cases.
Trying to use just the Bible as a guide to life is impossible as well.
I was angry for a few months. I felt that the anger would just eat me from the inside.
I have friends who are Americans. They took me inside their house.
I have no problems with any American. All I saw were good people.
I am a Muslim. My religion tells me to forgive. I always use my religion to guide me through my life.
I agree. People only take out. They follow what they want to believe.
This struck a chord with me. I think it speaks to how we need to be more open minded. It speaks to how we need to accept other viewpoints. Nobody can understand all of the aspects that go into these situations. and the myriad of factors that attribute to social issues in our nation.
People tend to believe that what they think is right. they do not listen to the other side's argument. This is one of the major issues in this country.
If we surround ourselves with people who look like us. Think like us. We will never grow. We will never see what else is out there.
It is ignorant to think that what you believe is right. It is ignorant not take the time to question your own beliefs. It is ignorant to not give thought to the ideas of others.
You could almost hear the crickets in the room. Sam said that these women felt empowered.
I never thought that the hijab oppressed these women.
The fact that it was our governments fault for the death of Basim's family. Thought that $2,000 would be enough to cover the damage. They have created in his life disgusts me.
It was our governemnts own fault. This tragedy occured. It is their job to fix it. Not insult the people.
I understand this. Basim does not hate the American people. What about the American government?
Our government should have double, triple checked everything they did. Especially with a bomb.
I am ashamed. Our government would let something like this happen. Our government would repay Basim with disrespect.
The video that impacted me most. The video in which Basim Razzo talked about not being angry at Americans.
When something awful happens. It is easy to hate the country itself. He was able to put that hatred aside. Speak to his American friends.
I feel like it gave me a new outlook on the war efforts. It made me think more about the decisions our country makes. Especially when sending people to war.
It is guys like Basim who make the world the better place to live.
That helps in having a sound mind. Is also good for your health.
Speaking about your last point. It is very important to have information about the things happening all around the world. Not only in the country that we live in.
It helps us know what the people in that region are actually going through.
I agree with what you were saying. Sometimes it is just easier to sugar coat life. Say things will get better.
It was shocking to me also that he responded this way.
a man his age I would expect him to be shining a light on the next generation He would be giving them something to look forward to
His statement that he doesnt see it getting better. Shows how bad the way of life has been changed.
I personally know so many people that blame every Muslim person they see for terrorism.
Even though the majority of terrorism that occurs in our country is not even caused by those who are Muslim.
I think we all know the answer to that one. How can they not see the flaw in their way of thinking?
I feel only a part of this. they do not even try to associate with those from other ethnicities.
Basims story was so alarming to me at first because it made me question how many other times incidences like this occur.
I remembered this happens every time. Our army kills innocent people. Trying to get the bad guy.
I feel like so many people do not see it as a reality. It is very real. It is extremely devastating.
Hearing him talk about his stages of grief. HIs goal of forgiveness was unreal. He was so open and honest about it.
He lost his wife and daughter in a brutal, sudden way only a few years ago He seems to be living the happiest life he is able.
I really had to step back and think. I were in his shoes. How would I feel if my life were taken from me? Because of the United States accident, I get offered money for my family members who were killed.
It really shows me that live is too short to stay mad at something forever. At the end of the day, time doesn't stop. Neither should we.
We grow up in an certain environment. We should be told to believe certain ideas. They should help shape our understanding of universal perspectives.
I was interested to see where he would take the class with this role reversal after his introduction to the class. I was disappointed.
I did not like how the class was scripted. It felt as though Sam was attempting to shock the class With statistics rather than talk about a very sensitive topic.
The American point of view is that we are the most influential nation in the world. Therefore, the politics of other nations must revolve around our own.
The promises that many presidents make fail. In the face of political battling and partisanship
The United States has a tendency to entrench itself in places. Where it engages in Nation building.
I vividly remember this question during class. it really made me think about a numerous of different things.
I think one of the main reasons why he was able to forgive. His understanding of the American people.
Most of the time the people who judge and hate have never really had an interaction with a person from the other background.
Holding grudges for long. Will put you into a state of anger. You can't do anything about.
Just another example of how the citizens of America are blinded to what is truly happening in the Middle East.
Bassim saying that nothing has changed between the presidencies is shocking. To me an American citizen I see a difference with each president. We have had.
It could also because I have noticed change in this country. I haven't been paying much attention to how other countries have been.
Political movements have become a thing that are beneficial to get into.
His views may have changed. Mine certainly did.
If you arent 100 percent sure. Don't go through with it. Wait to go with it. Another day or time.
You brought up a very interesting point. It is about comparing the fear of a country thats constantly at war to Americas 9 11.
It is crazy to me that we mourn the loss of the innocent people in New York that day to this day. Those types of losses happen daily in Bossims country.
The devastation they must constantly feel is unimaginable.
He doesn't hate the American people? Not with everything he has?
If we all walked a mile in Basim's shoes, I'm positive we would have a very different idea about the Iraqi people.
I really enjoyed getting to hear Basim's story. I am grateful that Sam allowed us all to experience something as raw as this.
The video I chose to reflect on is Introducing Basim Razzo.
we skyped Basim in class. It was the most interesting and inspirational class I have ever been to.
Here's the worst part of the situation. The United States government only gave him a couple thousand dollars. As if that was a reasonable apology.
If there was a war going on in the United States and a foreign country accidentally bombed a random civilians house, it would be the top news story for weeks.
It is so hard to believe. His story did not even make the daily neighborhood newspaper
You never know what is going to happen next in your life. everything in the world is so unpredictable
i start to think about it. I do completely agree with you.
The united states is more divided now than it ever has been. It's not going to change anytime soon.
I do believe that the use of violence on someone becasue they are a different religion is terrible.
We all have a choice in our lives on what we believe in.
That's also why I agree with you on your statement of the Georgia laws.
Im sure he was wondering why he was bombed. He had nothing to do with this war.
Here is the answer to the question. Why was that it was just a mistake? The only reaction I would have would be anger.
He had everything taken away from him. The United States military made an error in where to drop the bomb that day.
What makes it even worse is that as retribution for his family being killed, he was given a very small amount of money to repay him for his loss.
Bassim decided to take another approach.
They never forced me to pick a religion. I would rather make my own choice.
Watching this lecture gave me a throught-provoking question. Do we really need religion?
As a child, I never really saw the purpose of religion. It seemed to create more problems. Than solutions in the world.
However, when a small portion of the Christian population participate in the Charlottesville Rally, endorsing violence, racism, and antisemitism, President Trump does not advocate to ban Christians from the United States.
Maybe religion is a destructive pillar in society. It also has many benefits.
There are so many great qualities in religion. It makes it a shame how many people can use it for hateful purposes.
In the video, Bassims Advice To The Class, he asks us to be more aware of people and places outside of the United States His advice is that that we should all try to forgive people, even when it seems impossible.
Bassim said that it is much easier to be aware of what is going on in the world. This is thanks to the technology that we have today.
He also said that we should always try to forgive people.
I think it is important for us to all learn how to forgive even when forgiving seems impossible.
I think that this forgiveness also extends to ourselves.
I think that we all need to be able to forgive. I think that we should not forget. All experiences, even the ones that are not positive, shape us to be who we are.
I too could not believe how calm and at ease Bassim. I consider what had happened to him in his life.
He was able to take such grief. He turned it into positivity. He kept on living his life without hate.
I cannot imagine what your parents went through. I think everyone has different experiences. Everyone reacts in a different way.
I look up to Bassim for his calmness and forgiveness. I don't know if I could react in such way.
I have no idea what they've been through. I hope they can be able to live a happy live without the hate eating away at them.
He has every reason to label and hate all Americans.
Americans took everything he loved away from him.
It's shocking to me - the fact that we are constantly hearing about tragedies like this that happen to people in our own country. the media turns a blind eye to the own atrocities we cause others.
I think about how often they are all generalized as terrorists. A few extremists act.
This discussion, as with most discussions in this class so far. Have helped me see things from an entirely different perspective.
In this video Bassin addresses the student body. He gives his final remarks about his life and experiences.
There are women and men serving in the military without knowing the country they will be fighting a war with seems bizarre. It makes me wonder if this is a strategy to makes it easier to fight with people they know nothing about.
I agree with Bassim. Bassim comments that the media controls everyone in the United States.
I believe this will allow individuals to view the world and other cultures within the United States. They are something to be celebrated instead of feared or persecuted.
hearing what happened I was very saddened. alking to him on skype a whole other perspective of this situation came about. it made it real.
High schools and colleges are doing their best. They make sure that students are aware of the world around them. there is just too much constantly happening to teach that in a classroom.
Bassim brings up a great point. The technology today allows for immediate access to any information that you could want to learn.
Being able to hear first hand from people. Living in parts of the world that often slip our minds. An amazing opportunity that this class provides to its students.
I am very grateful that I have been able to see exactly what it is like for different people around the globe. It has opened my eyes beyond the stereotypes.
Bassims experiences in Iraq have showed me that the whole country is not at war. There are many people living their lives very normally there. They are not in constant fear of what is going to happen next.
A primary way these groups of people take over people. Dominate societies. Is by controlling and limiting forms of communication.
Regardless of how advanced a society is or its varying histories, a civilization can always be brought to its knees. Its forms of communication are determined by a governing entity.
This is what ISIS was doing. They cut the internet and satellite TV.
Not having preset lectures just opens the door. many topics to discuss in class.
I like how he talks about Islam often.
Muslims have such a negative stereotype in the U.S because of events that have happened in our history.
We cannot blame an entire religion of 1.8 billion people based on a handful of Muslims.
I found this interesting. His response to what ISIS forced upon Iraq is how most people in America think Muslims are.
An example of this is bearded Muslim men. They are very stereotypical. Basim said that they were forced to grow beards and shave mustaches.
The reality is that they are just normal people. Just like in America, not everyone wants to live so religiously.
His response was not what I would've expected. I do not understand his situation.
You can hear about the lives of someone across the world. You may not have experienced what they have experienced, Then you will never truly understand.
Sam invited Basim to talk. Basim talked about his experince. Basim talked about living in Mosul. Basim's talk really opened my eyes. to the effects war can have on a city and its people.
Basim is an example. His life was completely altered due to the effects of war. It caused destruction in his life.
Basim realizes this. He goes into talking about how he believes that his life in Mosul is probably over.
He knows Mosul will never be able to bounce back from this. its how the world works nowadays.
The video clip that I chose to watch is the class discussion with Basim Razzo.
I believe. This class was one of the most eye opening and interesting classes of the semester so far.
I realized that one of the things that I love the most in my life is my family.
When he said that he never gave up because him surviving the attack meant to him that god had a larger plan for him, I was truly moved.
All Muslims are not to blame. It's just the actions of a few.
Imagine Basim was able to come to this realization. why cant all Americans, or the entire rest of the world, as well?
While to us each president looks and acts differently. A different political party and policy. To these other countries. They might as well be the same  given that they're invading and bombing their homeland.
I feel. Sympathy has gone out of the window for many of us.
He lost everything. Some help getting him new things would have gone a long way.
We treated him horribly. I see why people dislike America.
The empathy isnt in the world anymore. It is specifically lacking within many Americans.
I feel that opinions many have of others are really hindering moving forward in becoming decent human beings to each other.
Instead, he continued to believe in our people. He can see the shades of gray in the world.
Another reason I believe that Basim was able to forgive, besides his faith, which he also discussed in class. I think he wanted to heal. He was eventually tired of being angry.
It's human nature to survive. Basim had to let go of his anger in order to move forward in life.
I am proud of Basim for staying true to himself, his family, his friends (including his American friends). Basim is true to his religion after the horrific, devastating life event.
Prior to hearing him in class, I was a person who held a lot of grudges.
When tragedies happen. You are upset and angry at all times. That anger and sadness will eat you up. Give you nothing to live for.
n event like Charlottesville is a perfect example of an event we can learn from. i am being upset about the events.
I truly think that that was the most important thing Basim taught us.
I myself try not to hold grudges. In my mind I really see no point.
What happened already happened. There is really nothing you can do about it.
I am not a religious person. He looks through religion to guide him. He looks through religion to make him happy. It is amazing how it really does work.
Anger does nothing for a person but make them do stupid things and not be themselves.
Bassim has every reason to not want to go on. He still does.
He continues to do so. He knows things will never be the same.
It was not the American people who chose to make the decision to bomb the people in Mosul. I think Basim in telling us this was attempting to raise awareness. We work to prevent our government from letting these events continue to happen.
If we took the time to respect this. We might be able to see a change in the world.
Sam could enlighten the rest of our society. Encourage people to step outside their comfort zone. Look at life through a different perspective.
This is a point that keeps reoccurring in my response. It is very powerful. The truth is sorry.
People formulate their opinions. Information is given to them.
The media controls the opinion of the people. They show only videos or stores of what they want them to think.
The world outside of the United States bubble is nothing like what the media is telling the people.
Almost his whole family was killed in the bombings (except his son).
People in the United States have started to act like its a norm when people in other countries die to bombings, attacks, etc.
So much more is going on in the world. Americans seem to not know anything about it.
It was humbl.ing We heard about the way ordinary civilians live in Iraq. The war surrounds them everyday.
I imagine Iraqis came to America I imagine they patrolled the streets likewise to how American soldiers do in Iraq, I wouldnt know how to live
Would I listen to what they said in my homeland?
Bassim explained how he moved to a different city in Iraq. Does he miss his hometown?
Or is it too hard for him to stay in the place where his family was killed?
How can he just forgive America? How can he forgive the actions we have done?
It makes me think. why does the U.S. government have to be so harsh? Why does it mess around with ordinary civilians in another country?
It makes me sick to my stomach. I feel so bad for all the lives that were taken.
Sam put together this visual of his life. It made him a real person to us. Some people may not have seen him as because of his race and religion.
Sam gave us images of this wonderful life he had.
He told us how Basim's house was bombed along with his brother's house. He showed us the pictures. He showed us the message he sent. I was completely heartbroken .
Sam made me imagine how I would feel if that happened to me.
How would I feel if a different countrys government came in and accidentally bombed my house with my family?
My thoughts the entire time was about what happened to Basim?
Sam found out about what Basim went through. Basims post on Facebook.
We did not put it in the news that we destroyed a family.
Does it happen so much that we dont think we should let the American people know what we are actually doing?
This was very interesting to me because. I heard about what Bassim went through. I dont think I could feel the same way that he does
With my feelings towards this, I admire Bassim greatly I am so thankful that he spoke to the class about his feelings towards what happened. He is not angry with us
This is another thing that I found interesting about this portion of the class. Bassim talked about and he came to forgive us through religion.
This got me thinking about another lecture we had. Sam pointed out how most religious teachings are essentially the same. This applied to what Bassim was saying.
I would be upset. I would have to go into solitude. Be numb. Basim said he was in the months following the murders of his family members
It can sometimes be very hard to relate to some of the social injustices for minority ethnicities because, as a white male, I have not experienced what a person of a minority ethnic race has experience.
That goes the same for myself. It is unfair of someone to judge me based off of my ethnicity.
It's unfair to assume one could do so.
You may gain a sense of where that person is coming from. It won't feel the same to you as it does to them.
This is the reason I find religion so fascinating. It is easy enough to understand the philosophy behind every religion. If you put the time and effort into understanding it.
In today's society, people are used to hearing about bad events taking place all around the world via television or internet.
I was in complete shock when Sam opened Skype. Bassim was there staring back at the class.
Bassim spoke about a lot of striking topics such as Mosul today, his family, his job, etc. the thing that stuck with me the most is the attached video clip above.
Bassim lost several close family members to an accidental bombing. He does not carry hatred or anger in his heart toward America.
Bassim is mature enough to acknowledge this fact. Not all American's act the same way as our government.
He mentions that he lived in the United States for eight years. He has a variety of American friends. Some allowed Bassim to live with them. They went on vacations together.
He proves the stereotype. People who live in the Middle East are all violent.
I feel like too many people hold grudges. It only detracts from their social life.
I think that the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Should be something that is discussed every year. Remember all the people that lost their lives on that day in New York.
There were so many thoughts going through my head not even during class, but the next day. We talked about what happened in our lab groups.
I was raised a Catholic. I went to Catholic school my whole life.
I was raised Catholic. I was taught to forgive and to turn the other cheek when hit. I was really shocked when he explained that he did not hate American people.
I agree with your opinion that the September 11 terrorist attacs. Attacked as a great driving force. That gave the American government even more reasoning to invade Iraq.
I find it awful though. the government tried to say that it was the sole purpose for invading Iraq. clearly oil was a big part of that decision.
I agree with your sports team analogy. All of these other nations are rooting against us. In reality this is just untrue. It's based on the radical groups from these nations.
I couldnt agree more with you. being able to really speak with Basim live through skype was something very memorable.
Like the most of us, I also struggled trying to relate to the tragedy that this poor man has had to go through. You put it perfectly by saying that Basims response and attitude were incredibly respectable and honorable.
To see a man who has basically lost everything. Still be able to live a happy life. Without any grudges is a miracle to see.
There was no one better. No one who could have taught me that lesson other than Basim himself. He overcame the hardest obstacles. I can't possibly imagine.
We can use the information that Bassim has given to us in our everyday lives. we should challenge the rhetoric used within the politics driven by hate and bigotry to make the world a more equal place for all.
Bassim has gone through an immense amount of tragedy in his life.
Bassim's wife, daughter, brother and nephew were killed. When Americans bombed his house. As well as his brothers.
Bassim is just a regular man, who was forever affected by an accident.
I have never experienced any kind of tragedy. Remotely close to what Bassim has faced. I can't even imagine how difficult this is.
He does this in hope that we might help others who have experienced loss He does this to have people be more aware that there are great people like him in Iraq.
For his son he has to keep his drive.
Imagine Bassim could keep going with this pain he carries. I could overcome my worries.
I don't always go to church on Sunday. I consider myself a good Catholic.
I find this class fascinating. We are able to talk to people from across the world about issues outside of the United States.
Sometimes are issues are so different. Sometimes we might be surprised to find we have many things in common.
I even remember the class going dead silent. His face came on the screen. Sam introduced him.
I was completely blown away. He said that he forgave us for what had happened to him.
I just can't imagine being able to move past that event. Almost everything you know and love is stolen from you by a miscalculation.
It really puts things into perspective. We hear just what the war in the Middle East has done to some people
He said that he was talking to a woman he had met before back in the States. He has a new family member.
He said that policy hasn't really changed. Each person has been president.
This is something. It really resonated with me.
This is why this lecture was so eye opening for me.
I am glad. I took it. it is different .
I also love the activities that we do during class.
Sam really makes you want to go to class. There are not many teachers you can say that about.
I didnt really find surprising. He said Iraq will never be the same after Isis.
I think at this point. ISIS changed the country. Did so much damage.
Its amazing how he attributes this to his Islam religion. Americans tend to attribute Islam with violence and terrorism.
It completely changed my whole view on what it meant to be Muslim.
Basim is truly an example of what letting your religion guide you in life should be like. hes truly someone who opened my eyes. He completely flipped the script for me in terms of how I viewed being Muslim.
I think. It takes a lot of courage to become so forgiving.
Basim has a good relationship with Sam. Sam is an American.
This gave us all a huge reality check to be thankful for the things that we have. This gave us all a huge reality check to be thankful for the country that we live in.
It really made me recognize how small my problems are, compared to some people.
I think if people simply looked at other people with fresh eyes like you said we would live in a very different world.
That is one of the most difficult things to do. I see things fully from another perspective.
The one example I can always think of is hurricanes.
There is no possible. We could relate to what happened to these people.
The important thing is that you have to at least try.
The problem that is occurring here and all over the world is that people simply do not try to see things from other perspectives.
The process that needs to be done is taking steps.
He subscribes to the school of thought that one shouldn't hold an entire nation responsible for what was done to him by their military.
He even says that the Americans that he met here took him into their home. They became his friends. They went on vacations with him.
That kind of pain usually leads to a dark rage. Takes up a person's entire being. Negatively affects their spiritual, mental and physical health.
Losing the most important things to you in life. Takes a huge toll on your emotions.
To be able to bounce back from such a terrible situation. That takes so much strength and willpower.
I would have thought Basim would try to get as far away as possible. Hearing him speak I now realize how difficult that would be to do.
His answer made a whole lot of sense. It was hurting me more than it was benefiting me.
He finds peace with what he has left. Him not dying in the bomb attack was a blessing of its own.
We need to start seeing life this way.
Bassim was completely right when he said that.
Yes, what happened to him was horrific. I can never imagine what he has went through. Staying overly angry for the rest of his life and having so much hatred would just destroy him
He needs to go on with life. He can get justice for his family with the American government.
I found his answer to be so profound on so many levels.
It reinforced my belief on forgiving others for yourself. It is not for them. staying hateful and angry only hurts yourself in the end.
I thought it was interesting that you said it shocked you. When Basim's house and city were shown.
This is a common misconception that most people have about other countries. It is mainly due to what they are exposed to from the media. It is just general ignorance.
Basim said we need not to be consumed with ourselves. We don't have compassion.
I should read up on what's going on around the world. It can clear up these misconceptions.
I'm glad. You have put some thought. The media can portray places that suit the way. They want Americans to see it.
I hear a lot of people generalize the idea that all muslims are violent. This leads to so many other false stereotypes.
Confusion and ignorance usually leads to generalizations. That is the last thing we want to do in order to understand what is preached in this class.
He said everything has changed.
What will this lifetime of chains do to the younger generations?
It is so inspiring to know that he can forgive America.
It makes me impossibly sad to know. In America, people who did not lose anything personally in 9 11 use their religion and religious differences to hate others.
I feel so lucky to be in this class. I get to experience people like Bassim who push my way of thinking.
I hope everyone takes the time to get to know people from all over the world. study here at Penn State.
Miranda, I completely agree with you in that we should not follow the Bible or the Quran word for word. They are very old and times have changed a lot.
I cant understand why people still claim to say that they follow these books word for word. End up picking and choosing. What they want to agree and disagree with.
Some people in the Christian or Muslim community still do not support gay marriage. Due to the fact that as stated in the Bible and quarn. It is a sin to be gay.
It makes me sad how sometimes horrible things happen. there is no relief or sense of closure for the people. it deals with a section of government. we arent supposed to talk about it.
How can people not imagine their own families. When seeing these awful things done to other people.
Basim was such a delight to have as a guest in this class. I really appreciated hearing everything he had to say.
I think it takes a very, very strong person to tell that story to a group of complete strangers. He had no problems. I think it really speaks to his character.
Basim has dealt with such a tragedy. Basim is such a beautiful soul. Basim truly was the light of the room during this class.
After this class I made all of my friends go back and watch these clips. So they could understand why I walked home sobbing that day. So they could see what a truly amazing person looked like.
It is important for us to learn about the experiences innocent citizens in the middle east are having during the war. It is not often shown in the media.
I know that I personally take for granted how safe the United States is. We are fighting a war.
They are strong for trying live a normal life despite that life taking place in the middle of a war zone.
First of all, this video was particularly interesting to me. I was wondering the same question myself.
How could that even be possible after what he described?
This also gained my attention. It's just like what the Bible says Its followers are to do if they are true believers.
Basim does not say it in the video. However, I remember him saying that same line in class during the interview.
He started praying five times a day now. He takes his studies more seriously now. This is because his god did not let him die.
Im reacting to Will Iraq Ever Be the Same After ISIS video from SOC119. it is really heartbreaking hearing someone. He lived through Isiss takeover of Iraq. he has no hope in the foreseeable future for his country.
I never paid attention to what was going on over there in the middle east. I knew is that there were bad people there with malicious intent.
It paints a picture of what we never are informed about.
We only hear about war one time. That's when it comes to Iraq. It's insane how we look over the people living there. They are in the real struggle.
I sympathize with them. I put myself in their position.
They'd probably restrict internet access Internet access is extremely important to remain informed with world events today.
I feel really bad about not learning about this beforehand. I think its very important.
I feel whatever happens over there does have an impact. It impacts us over here in some manner.
I have the upmost respect for those forced to go under Isis rule. They do so to survive and to keep their families safe.
It is crazy to think about what would have been avoided. Imagine if oil did not exist in Iraq.
Sam told the class of Basim's story. I was obviously in utter shock.
Sam showed the message. Basim sent him shortly after his family was killed. His house was destroyed. My stomach dropped.
I thought something was crazy. How he moved past what happened to his family was crazy.
It was crazy. Sam brought up that the bombing was never important enough to make any newspapers. For Basim and Sam, it was a huge deal.
I think we as Americans forget to think about the innocent people of places that have been affected by our military and the destruction of war.
He actually had it in his heart to forgive the country. That uprooted his entire life. Takes so much to overcome.
We have to all appreciate the fact that Basim opened up to us. It showed us how war really can hit home for people. It's not just a thing to think about. It's very real in effecting respectable people's lives.
How could a person not be completely consumed by hatred? They have nothing left.
Basim was stripped of everything he had in life. It was due to an accident.
When asked by a student how are you not angry. Bassam gave a simple answer. Anger was hurting me more than it was helping me.
The word Islam actually means peace. Its disheartening to hear Americans discriminate the entire religion. Because of a few unfortunate events
It is so easy for a person to construct their own views on an entire religion based on a few interactions.
Our nation could be on a much more progressive path. Leaders such as Trump are prolonging this stagnation.
I thought his connections to Americans was very important for his healing process after the events.
He thought about real people from the country that killed his family. He realized no, it is not the peoples fault, it is the government.
I think it is important to know something. The events that caused Basim's tragedies are nothing new to the world.
That had really changed the idea about Islam in some states too.
I come from a Hindu family. My mother is a Hindu. She has a wrong opinion on the Muslims.
After the conservative party (BJP) came to rule. There has been a lot of violence from the many Hindu groups in India.
It somewhat makes me feel as a hypocrite.
A few group of people who claim to follow Muslim and cause destruction is labelled a terrorist. At the same time when someone who follows your religion cause destruction  They are judged by the same eyes.
It was really important that Sam designed this class to show what it would be like if black people became the leaders in American society. This really shines light on the fact that white people have long abused their influential roles in this country.
This activity proved that African American people in this country have never been able to achieve equality in this country. This system in the United States has been devised only to suit the needs of white Americans.
I feel that we, in America, have progressed a lot since the times of slavery and Jim Crow Laws. We certainly have not fully addressed the injustice against minorities that still exists in this country.
I see events like this. It makes me question the thought process behind our government.
I also like the point you brought up about the power of forgiveness. Although he was able to forgive and move on. What I think disturbs me most is that they offered him next to no compensation for the loss of his family.
Not that money will bring his family back. Fix what happened. If I was Bassim I would have been offended
Hi Rachel, I agree with Bassim's remarks. Bassim said how the American citizens absorb too much information from the media without digesting it.
People tend to live in their world where what they know is good. What they are unsure of is thought for them. It is deemed to be bad by the media.
I think that racism is a result of looking at the wrong side in a story. many believe the struggle in the middle east is over freedom. many believe the struggle in the middle east is over establishing democracy. we are stripping these people of both. and leaving them in a state of misery and destitution.
I think that it is very hard to imagine actually living in a war zone for most Americans. We have never experienced it.
This lecture made me think. This war affects the good people who live in these areas, not just radical hate groups. They make up a very small percentage of the population.
At some points it felt really forced. Kind of like awkwardly scripted to get points across. That may have just been intentional to avoid awkwardness.
I felt like it was a pretty insightful class
I know that is only one aspect of getting jailed. It shows once again how corrupt our society is.
Something that he did as his religion tells him to do.
Forgiving is something really hard to do. Your life may be completely broken due to other people,just like it happened to Basim.
The most possible think to happen to Basim. he would have probably gone mad. of all the hate inside.
I think the advice Basim left to the class was very important. It is hopefully something we as Americans can work towards.
I would agree. Many people get caught up in the news occurring in their own country. They become almost oblivious to the events occurring half way around the world. It's because they are so far removed from them.
agree that the media is partially to blame. The job of the media is to get the truth out. That isnt what always happens.
My political updates consist of seeing people tweet at Trump. My political updates consist of getting CNN notifications when Trump tweets something dumb.
Prior to this class, I actually had no clue what Sharia was.
I'm a Christian. Sam said that class was going to be about Christian Sharia my ears perked up.
It's interesting though. The Crusades were pretty much the Christian version. They were imposing terror on people that didn't agree with certain views.
It's important to know that Americans say things laughable. things like Muslims are terrorists it is such an inaccurate thought that its laughable.
A terrorist is not truly someone who is practicing Islam. A KKK member is not a true Christian.
I know from previous knowledge that not all Muslims are terrorists.
The fact that he went through something so terrible. How he was still able to realize that being so angry would harm him more than benefit him shocks me.
Another thing I found interesting about his situation is that hes planning on returning to Mosul soon.
I was actually shocked by this. Ive never heard of someone wanting to go back to the place where their life was practically taken from them.
I feel like this shows in a sense how he isnt letting that horrible event completely define him life.
I think that it is really important for all people to be empathetic. It can be tricky sometimes for all people to be empathetic.
I liked how you said that in order to be empathetic. we need to step out of our comfort zones. embrace what it is like in someone else's shoes.
I think. We all need to constantly remind ourselves to be open-minded. We all need to constantly remind ourselves to see the world in as many different perspectives as we can.
He remarked that hopefully within 20 to 30 years there will be hope for that generation. He has no hope for the foreseeable future.
This perspective on Afghanistan was very surprising to me. Every video I see of Afghans, they are always very optimistic. Every video I see of Afghans, they are always hopeful of their futures.
It is understandable for him to be pessimistic. His country has been at war for decades.
It shook me when he talked about having to change his entire lifestyle when ISIS came in.
However, I do know that is not what always happens.
I thought for the longest time that all the people from those countries are militant I thought for the longest time that all the people from those countries are radical.
It truly warms my heart to see how he could forgive. He has lost so much in such an unjust way.
He knows that it is a select group responsible. It's not all of the United States.
He is truly a role model. He is someone to look up to in the sense of true enlightenment.
they may be followers of a specific religion. followers should not be indicative of that religion.
I feel like Sam did a very good job highlighting it. the Bible and the Quran can be perceived in many different ways. They can be taken to many extremes based on who is interpreting them.
In their minds, their view is the only truth. those they are directing their hate to are the horrible and twisted people that we see them as
I feel like this disconnect comes from a lack of awareness. Our perspective of anything is never the only one.
In the case of the bible and the clip from class, some people may wonder why it is that others may interpret a passage in a way that completely contradicts their own interpretation of it.
They both place their faith in the same book. That is the culture they grew up in.
The bible is just one way to exemplify this concept. It can be applied to anything.
That is the whole situation in this country. There are many other countries that we do not know enough about.
This definitely makes me feel lucky as well.
I think that wars should not be fought at all.
Sam had told us before the discussion started that this particular class would be concerning empathy. I was not prepared to face the extent in which empathy would be shown to us that day.
We viewed many pictures of Bassim along with his wife, his children we saw his brother, his nephew we even saw images of their homes
They loved one another. it was very obvious to see that through the photos. the words Sam had said about Bassim.
Both of their homes were destroyed. We saw in the images. Their beautiful homes were now piles of rubble.
I was beyond upset. I was horrified. I was guilty. I felt many other emotions. thinking to myself that my own government had ruined the lives of these innocent individuals.
I know that if I were him, what happened would be unforgivable in my eyes.
Bassim had said that he does not hate us. He is not angry. He knows our governments goal. Was to protect the citizens and not hurt him.
Although it can be diminishing, it is also very intriguing and makes me actually want to learn about. I would like to listen to people from different parts of the world, like Bassim, so that I can gain that kind of knowledge
You hear stories about war. You feel bad for the victims. You just kind of move on with your life.
When Basim appeared on the screen, I immediately shed a tear.
Everyone he cared about was gone in an instant. Here he was, casually talking to a class of American students.
A foreign government came to my land in search of my resources. My life was destroyed. I would hate them.
The first time I was introduced to a different perspective on war. my comparative literature classes at Penn State.
It was a human rights violations class. My professor focused on the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Basim's answer was the most amazing response to this question. That is all I could have imagined.
He explained. At first, he was numb to what had occurred. He stated. He became so angry for a long time.
He explains that the anger was so tense. The anger was eating him.
At this point I had to stop. I had to take a step back to try to imagine what this must have been like.
Personally, I did not really have much of an idea what the everyday Afghani man was like. did they give me a good opening impression with this incredible man Bassim.
Hopefully, hearing what Basim had to say. Will have an impact on all who listened. Will make them realize things from the other side.
Hes saying there is no point in holding grudges or staying angry with people. It does nothing positive for you.
I found something interesting from Basims response It was his reasoning behind why he is not angry at America.
Basim went to college here. Basim would have stayed here permanently. His father made him promise to return back to Mosul,
I thought if he did not experience American culture. People first hand. Would he have been able to have the same feelings to use.
This opened my eyes. I was able to see why some of the people from these areas feel the way about America as they do.
I think its very easy to have a warped perception of us. Imagine all you see was a negative.
Can a person really be oppressed if they don't feel oppressed.
Who am I as a third party to say? Someone is oppressed. They deny. They are oppressed.
The hijab is part of the muslim religion. The women that wear the hijab do not see it as sexist.
I do believe. The true identity of the hijab lies with the people who wear them.
I do not believe. There are right and wrong answers to this discussion. Truth of the matter ultimately rest with the women who wear them.
In 14 years, we have had three different presidents. We have seen that nothing has really changed.
Between the Americans and Iraqi people
Every presidential administration has promised that it would do something to fix the corruption that is taking place in this country. Basim is telling us that nothing is being done to improve the tension taking place in Iraq whatsoever.
I feel that our presidents must do more. It comes to Iraq.
The standard of living there is very different compared to that here in the United States.
I feel that the President should have more responsibility in fixing tensions. tension may occur between his her country ,other.
It looks bad that we have had issues with Iraq. Iraqis feel hopeless to an extent. They want change in some way to fix problems.
This is something that I was recently shocked to discover.
It was not until the Russians came during the Cold War that the country had been devastated. The society was ruined. The population displaced.
It is very disheartening. I see such things happen across the world in different places.
There has been an increased fear in America since the 9 11 attack.
People hating Muslim's. Of something someone with the same faith did is pure ignorance.
The fact that Basim forgives us shows what kind of person he and many others are.
This is a very hard hitting question. The answer Basim gave. Was extremely beautiful.
He knows. Those that went through with the bombing were not average American citizens.
If I were Basim I am not sure I could forgive that easily. I hope my heart would open to see the bigger picture.
Call Muslims violent oppressive people. Muslims infringe on their beliefs.
Him speaking makes it real. we hear about bombings in the middle east all the time on the news. but we never the repercussions it has on the normal people who live there.
War is never a good thing. I thought it was cool how Sam presented one of the main reasons we entered Iraq.
Many in our country don't realize how many innocent civilians lost their lives because of this senseless war.
Just imagine. You were sleeping at night. Another countries military accidentally bombed your house killing much of your family and losing pretty much everything you have.
all these horrors of war. war is glorified in the United States.
I found it truly interesting. All the media wants you to think of Islam is sharia law, violence and terrorism. It is what helped Basim forgive. It dispelled his anger.
The learning process may take longer than it should. I have been able to move past that hatred for the Muslim religion as a whole. See it for what it is.
I agree with a lot of what you said Jessica.
I feel like you did a better job. These are some of the things I wanted to say my.
I completely agree with what you had to say. I have so much admiration for Bassim because of the level of maturity, positivity, and empathy. He is able to enlighten us.
I agree. It is so crucial to educate oneself. It is so crucial to research more that is given from one single article, tweet, or any social media post.
I do not have to worry about being killed for not following. A stupid rule put in place by people. I did not vote for.
I also can not imagine having my family stolen and decimated the way his was.
They have been extraordinarily influential in my shaping of my personality.
This gave a real perspective as to the many different ways things can be interpreted.
Similar to Islam, the Bible has a bunch of rules that are left to be interpreted by whoever reads it.
This says a lot about the way people can interpret religious readings. we started talking about how radical ideas can come to be.
ISIS and the Taliban are terrorist groups. terrorist groups make Muslims have the stereotype of being dangerous, especially in American culture.
citizens in other countries might view all US presidents the same. Imagine US presidents claim they will change their foreign policy from the previous president. citizens in other countries barely experience the difference
Basim provided numerous examples. He provided ways in which US intervention in Iraq has compounded the several problems already in the area.
It's crazy to see how the bible can be interpreted by different types of people.
I am raised in a Catholic church. I have not really sat down and interpreted the bible.
Some people take the bible veryseriously. Some read the passages during church.
Some people use the bible as a guide through life. They only follow the what the bible says.
I am not really that religious. I was raised Catholic.
Religion does seem like a means of hope for some. When others use it as a crutch to back up certain beliefs just because the Bible says so, then it seems like it is doing more hurting than helping.
People like Rafi , his children have to go thru it his children do not know another world. They know the one they see in Afghanistan.
Many soldiers from the US army have been killed in combat for fighting in a war. Most people do not even know. We are fighting in.
Whenever I thought about Afghanistan, I thought of the desert. Whenever I thought about Afghanistan, I thought of not many people living there other than terrorists.
I realized that there is people on both sides. There are soldiers going into a country that they have no business being in, and civilians of Afghanistan that have to continue to deal with bombing. There aretheir own civilians being killed.
First and foremost, I thought it was intriguing to Skype with a Mosul citizen. The Mosul citizen.had a firsthand experience with the American government.
These mistakes can negatively alter the lives of those who are innocent or undeserving.
Stories as these are one's that don't typically make the news. That is why many individuals are unaware of these types of incidents.
Living in a growing era of technology, I am hopeful that a more precise system to detect our enemies will be created. That it can prevent reduce the number of those who are unintentionally sought out.
I put myself in his shoes for a minute. I tried to imagine what life would be like. A group of people randomly came in. A group of people changed my whole way of life one day.
All of our bridges were bombed. It will be impossible to get anywhere.
There would be a massive loss of income due to the amount of people unable to get to work. It is one huge problem on its own.
Stating that a this class is a class on empathy. It is not just learning about race and sociology.
It broads the horizons of how people think of other races. We truly are not that different.
I completely agree with your point. I have always had a general view on war. I have never aftermath of such.
Having a real life person tell you about he personally was affected by the war really puts it into perspective.
Forgiveness is a hard thing to do. It is liberating when it is done.
We are in control of our happiness. how we react to difficult situations really shows us who we are.
I think you got to put in his feet and think forward in your life.
Even though his country is a country of war, it would make sense that he would want to be in his homeland just like the citizens who live there continue to live there throughout the war.
(Id also like to add that the girl with her jaw dropped around 9:45 in the video is exactly how I reacted to the tear jerking story of Basim and his family.)
I was completely stunned and speechless. He told the room.
How in the world can you put a price on someone's life?
It won't fix any damage done to his life other than materialistic and physical things.
It got me thinking about war. It is necessary.
I thought about it. This kind of stuff happens all the time around the world.
It's a sad thought. It's a fact.
Basim's response to the bombings. Of forgiving the United States. A true testament to the man that he is.
I dont think many of us in that lecture could say. We could forgive. We could move forward the way he has.
They are normal people with families who work. They are normal people who go to school. They are normal people who want to live a peaceful life just like us.
He coped with his loss in a very respectable manner. I understand why he was numb in the beginning of the process.
You were dead on. you said it was amazing how he dealt with the situation.
I appreciate Bassim. He taught us our Soc 119 class.
In a world surrounded by technology, people often disregard the thoughts and feelings of one another In a world surrounded by technology, people lack empathy towards others.
This is something that was passed down from our grandparents. It has been more inflated due to our access to technology.
peoples eyes need to open up to the other side of things . we can have empathy towards people like Basam.
This was surprising to me. I honestly never knew how they felt.
Overall though, this was definitely one of my favorite activities performed in class.
I am in disbelief on Bassims ability to be forgiving to people. The country that caused a very dark time in his life.
He seems to be very open minded. This is because of his religion.
He has inspired me to keep my eyes open to more things that are going on around me. do not let previous negative events cloud my judgement on something.
It was great that he is trying to teach his way of viewing life to the students here.
One thing I noticed was that Isis is terrible. Isis is only an outlier to what the people there were really like.
After listening to the man speak as well as the pictures that I've seem, Mosul will never be the same.
Those are the places. They patrol at least.
I don't think that higher officials of our government understand the responsibility that they need to uphold. the impact that they have on the future.
Listening to the man speak made it sound like living in Mosul was like being caught between a rock and a hard place.
I agree with absolutely everything you had said in your post. I chose this particular discussion to write my post about.
Many Americans live their lives not knowing the disasters that are occurring every single day in other parts of the world. being unaware that their own government could quite possibly be destroying the lives of others.
This country is learning to grow upon by hatred. You are extremely correct. What we need right now is to forgive.
Also, I find it ironic that modern-day Asians get much better treatment here in the United States than the Native Americans do!
According to Sams map, Asians (who eventually evolved into their Native American group) were in North America far longer than any European.
A group who is native to this country should be respected. Native should not just pushed over to the side like they dont matter.
If their drillings caused a predominately white town to be uprooted, there would be tons of backlashes in the media.
It was awesome that we were able to actually speak to Basim Razzo. He was answering the class' questions.
I don't know how someone would not be full of anger when they lost basically everything.
I think its amazing that so many of us could come to this conclusion from hearing the man talk one time.
I think that it says a lot. This is the way Basim views humanity.
I also thought that it was interesting that he was able to completely recognize his stages of grief.
I felt like this gave a insight. I was connecting it to an issue that I did not expect.
They had this will imposed on them. our country is the one imposing our will on Syria.
We are different from North Korea. They are a dictatorship. We have the right to elect our leaders.
The citizens of North Korea are not responsible for their leaders actions. they have no real possibility to change their leaders, while we do.
I can not imagine having been in his position. I feel like I would be so bitter after having my life nearly destroyed by another country that is not even my own.
I could tell that Basim had given this a lot of thought over the years of dealing with these tragedies. He was genuine during class.
Basim truly opened my eyes to the harsh reality. What is going on across the world?
Often times I do not recognize this. I am so sheltered in America.
I can not help. I feel sympathy for those who live in places plagued with war.
It is not often that I get to learn about different cultures. Not especially from someone who has been through so much.
viewers will have to question whether they can trust the sources. many will just not take the time at all.
The best thing to do would be to read pieces from each different perspective. try to understand a topic. were given a news market of people. people are totally uninformed. or woefully misinformed.
Up until that lecture my access to the Iraqi population perspective was virtually zero. This is true for issues across both social and international borders.
Many innocent people died in ways impossible to comprehend.
This day was the day that America decided to go to war.
America by accident bombed his house. It killed his wife along with his daughter.
They bombed his brothers house. Killed his son. Who was Basims nephew.
It's sad to see these people face to face. Be able to tell. Their entire life has revolved around war. Always living in fear.
I couldn't imagine trying to live a life like that.
It's the government. It's not me. People need to understand that. There is more to a country than its government. especially when deciding to form an opinion on that countries people.
It is obviously a lot easier said than done. It is not easy dealing with a tragedy of this magnitude.
His character is strong I say this. I really don't know if I could ever forgive.
You can't put a price on human life. No amount of money could ever make this all better.
I was also shocked at the fact that Basam could forgive the people that had done this to his home and family.
The fact that he is so connected to his faith after an accident like this should be applauded.
Compare the closeness of the Muslim religion and Christianity. It shows that the Muslim religion has a more empathetic side to their beliefs.
Christians often preach their beliefs to be better than others. They don't accept the beliefs of some.
To go through such a tragedy and still come out on the other side with such grace and a positive outlook on life is honestly so inspiring, and although nobody should ever have to go through something like that he really made the most out of the situation and seems like a happier person now because of it.
I found something really sad. We never saw his story on the news. We never saw his story here in America.
Should we not be aware of these things? When they happen?
I'm very happy he's suing the U.S. government. After going through what he did, he deserves way more than that.
It is easy for individuals to become blinded by their anger. It causes a great level of ignorance.
It makes me think of 9 11. People behave in this manner.
Bassim did not generalize our people after what was done to him. We should not generalize his people.
I am a see the glass as half full kind of person. I also understand that positive is not the only possibility in the world.
I think it's amazing. He realized that being angry at America won't help him at all. It could make him feel worse about it.
He decided that its best if he forgives. He knows that there is nothing he can do about it now. He shouldn't spend the rest of his life being angry.
One cannot have empathy without a degree of sympathy. They are two different things.
In a second, almost everything you have in the world is gone.
Even your pets. The idea that your entire life can be torn away in a second is a terrifying one. Most of the Iraqi people lived it almost everyday of their lives.
This is why I find it incredible that Bassim had everything taken from him, only to turn around. he does not feel anger towards the American people.
Some generalizations people make about certain groups are hateful. They are often learned from the media, or from peers and family.
It is a shame to consistently see Muslims from all over the world because of their religion. Christians have been doing worse all across the world also.
Sam described the reasons we invaded Iraq. It helped clear up a lot of the confusion I had on the topic.
It was interesting. Sam brought up his Ted Talk video about the U.S. invasion.
How a person goes about handling tragedies like these. Their responses, to me, all depends on their upbringing.
Our society is constantly focused on equality. Giving everybody equal opportunities.
Those are ideals that we preach as a nation.
How free and equal are we really.
This story just demoralizes me. I have never even considered something like that happening to me.
This is one of the most horrific stories I have ever heard. it's crazy to think that everyone who lived in Mosul has to fear about their lives every second of the day.
Bassim has really inspired me to become a more forgiving person. He made me realize. The problems in our life in the US are so miniscule. He has endured.
It was important. I think he left a lasting impression on many students.
I think many of us want to deny the censorship the United States has over the media stream.
I agree this was excellent advice to college students.
Listening to Basim's story genuinely broke my heart. During this class I cried tears of sadness. His unimaginable pain. What my country had done to his family. their carless efforts of repayment for his familys deaths.
If something like this had happened to me. I would not only hate. I would never trust any American ever again.
I wish to be as strong as this man one day. Lord knows I would have been on a rampage if anything like this were to happen to me.
That is the craziest thing. They get no recognition.
I want them to know they are appreciated. What they do has a huge impact. People like my classmates.
This is something I can see happening in anyone's life.
You can not solve a problem with anger. You channel that anger into something more useful. You can feel better.
He does mention that he lived in America. All he saw was the good in people.
He states that he has lived in America. Every individual he has met has been kind. He cannot be angry at all Americans.
This line really hit me hard. I was listening to Bassim speak.
Bassim had gone through, in my mind, the worst possible tragedy a parent could encounter.
I continuously question the leadership of America. I had never done seriously before.
This post is about the character and morals of the man that was elected to lead or country.
Trump is living in his own world. We will never be the same great nation that created great changes throughout the world.
Sam talked about all of the Christians who have done horrible things. t really throws me back.
This is the story about a Christian boy killing black people in a church. It makes me realize that there are some people who interpret the bible differently.
For the longest time. I thought that people that lived through the Christian faith. Had the same mindset that I do.
I used to have something against Islam. I have heard of these heart wrenching stories. I will no longer think this way.
I am guilty of this type of thinking . this class helped to change it.
I respect everything he said in the video. I totally understand what he has to go through as a perso. Who loses a house to a ctastrophic disaster.
The fact that he is able to stay strong is just impressive. The fact that he is able to live life again is just impressive.
The unexpected flood occurred at a very rapid rate. my friends were unable to prepare .
In this case is the similarity between my friends and Basim. They were casualties in their situation. They were able to forgive. They did not get stuck on their loss.
I truly respect Basim. Basim has American friends. Basim had no intention to put the mistakes of the American Army on them.
The fact that he is able to put the hate aside and use forgivenessas a motivation to continue living his life is impressive.
I thought his response to this question was extremely powerful.
Basim lost absolutely everything. His house was bombed accidentally by Americans.
Basims response shows how to take the high road. Basim's response shows that one persons actions cannot change your view on an entire population of people.
One American, who took everything away from him, does NOT represent the entire America.
Many Americans view Muslims in a negative light. Due to events like 9 11. That were clear terrorist attacks on our country.
I found it interesting when he said that no matter who the president The effects of war have always been the same. He is angry at the U.S. government. Not the citizens themselves.
His city is rubble. His love for his family makes him want to go back home. This made my heart warm. This restored my faith in humanity.
Basim was an average guy from Afghan. He had a normal life.
Sams personal history with Basim made the story even more emotional to listen to.
I have continued to reflect on the interactions we had with Bosim.
No matter the religion a person practices, no person should have to under go what happened to Bosim.
Tragedy made him a stronger person. Tragedy allowed him to take his knowledge further. His knowlege into the lives of others increased.
I do not believe that. I am theperson in the world who makes this assumption.
He was able to make such a name for himself in the Afghani world. To have his whole life destroyed. The accidental bombing of Americans. Something tragic to listen to.
This was an American family being accidentally bombed by the Afghani people. It would be all over the news.
I could not imagine. I could not have gone through what Bassim has been through.
I agree with you. Muslims are not portrayed well in society.
The slides were cool and funny.
This made me think. What would it be like if it were normal to hear news like this?
We would see many more Americans opposing war. Hearing stories about the atrocities we commit were more normal.
This idea is very empowering to think about. People all around the world judge others without even giving them a chance.
This class, Sociology 119, is teaching Penn State students. Be aware of their surroundings. Be more accepting of everyone.
These stigmas that people hold about others is shaping the world into a place that is not accepting of most people. It tends to create a hostile environment in many situations.
I know for myself. This class has already changed the way. I think about so many things.
In my life I try to be accepting of all people. After taking this class I am even more aware of how I look at others.
This lesson on empthy. The rest of the lessons taught in this class. Things that are hard to teach. Are important to know about.
I talked about how the radicalization of these religious readings can be interpreted in different ways. radicalization can lead to the formation of some of the group you mentioned in your response.
This goes back to the idea you mentioned about being fair. try to gain full knowledge of what is really going on without making rash assumptions.
I can't speak for everyone. Members of your own group. Will be more important. Than members of someone else's.
Within the United States. Subjects like living wages. Are considered controversial topics.
It gets even more saddening when we take it outside of the US.
We have to also be empathetic toward those who are not a part of the us.
During the bombing, multiple members of Bassims family were murdered including his wife.
Bassim has gone through more tragedy in his life than anyone I have ever met. Somehow he is able to give off such positive energy.
he was asked by a student how he has the internal fornitude to be able to due this e responded in basically saying that he doesnt really have a choice.
I cant imagine what Id do if I were in his position. I would most definitely not be able to handle it the way he is able to.
It is truly an eye opening story. It shows how cruel this world can be.
This group can be compared to groups like ISIS. ISIS uses the Quran to justify their practices of hate on a much more extreme scale.
Sam was introducing this story. Something caught my attention.
What if some foreign military came into the United States. Infiltrated our cities and streets. To get natural resources.
When he flipped that perspective, I thought about how I would feel.
How could somebody do this to me?
What did I do to deserve this when I'm simply living my life day to day conflict free?
Dominant groups like to have an us vs. them mentality. It makes them feel more powerful.
In reality, we all share 99.9% of our DNA. No one race or religion is better than another. It's a horrible part about human nature. People start to feel superior to everyone else.
I was heartbroken. His outlook on life post incident was incredibly inspiring.
A student in the class asked how has the change of the US presidency affected Iraq since 2003.
I thought it would have affected it a lot. The President is the commander in chief.
I am not surprised to find corruption in Iraq.
It is sad politicians accept illegal money to help their own cause. immoral that this is true. politicians,as was mentioned in the video, accept illegal money to help their own cause.
I feel bad for the Iraq citizens. There's talk of decreasing their already low wages even more.
Times are tough right now. It is hard to find hope. Hope is very much needed in this time.
Talking about perspective. I think it is important.
Sam asked how often we correct people when they say ISIS are Muslims. It grabbed my attention.
Like Sam mentioned in class, we tend to have a sort of Islamophobia perspective on people in this nation. I feel that part of that stems from the media.
That takes extreme strength and wisdom.
Its not that Bassim no longer feels pain from the loss of his family. He has felt that pain. He accepted it. This allowed him to move on and focus on his future. rather than trying to change the past.
People need to be taught about the rest of the world. Grasping a better view of each part of the world.
It would be beneficial for the world to start teaching younger generations. people of different religions and backgrounds are no different than those who you are surrounded by and live with.
The simple things we take for granted everyday of our lives had just vanished for him.
This video puts into perspective. The lives that are being changed.
I believe Sam is right. He talks about how we do not understand what effect history has on the world.
Going into the lecture, I already had a sense of what Sam was showing us.
I had a terrible feeling. Sam showed us his house.
Even if it is is small ways it still pervades our everyday society.
It is just a cultural difference.
it comes down to it, we are all trying to survive. do not judge people, know them first. generalizing cultural characteristics gets in the way of our judgement.
I am not sure what I would do. I faced something like what Bassim faced.
I think. The message that Basim gave us was very important.
We let the media change our perspective of different places. It is our decision whether to take the information the way the media wants to deliver it to us. We can research. What is actually going on in the world.
I find it extremely shocking. He is going to be returning to Mosul in the years to come.
I definitely had made the assumption that all Muslims hated Americans. Bosim showed us all that this is in no way true.
He has every right to voice his opinion. The American government needs to change their actions towards the Afghani citizens. It has taken the lives of so many innocent people.
It was extremely inspiring to hear about his life following the bombings. He manages to stay so optimistic.
He uses his religion to guide him through life. He is able to be compassionate towards others.
It's hard to believe. Someone who has endured so much tragedy still has the power to be so positive and forgiving.
The only media we see of Afghanistan is war. That is why we have the negative images in our head.
I've always just thought of the military as 100% devoted to sole protection.
Another opportunity for seeing things from a different perspective arises.
Sam brought up the fact. Both countries share so many normal families, people, and things.
You can take a step back. You need to look at things in a different way. Your understanding of ideas that aren't your own suddenly becomes deeper.
Every other class I have ever taken is always based on the past.
I had never thought to think. The innocent people in these countries. I feel like our media only portrays the bad people like the terrorists.
Hearing their stories has really made me want to change my life.
I really hope Basim and Rafi can make differences in their countries. Help their country rebuild as it should have been ages ago.
Sometimes, it would be easier to just have an Islamic type of divorce. Settling everything. Going back and forth for years.
I think. This is where empathy comes in.
This portion of class I found to be particularly interesting. Once again, I was challenged to look at an aspect of life I was aware of in a whole new life.
Sharia Law is something I had been hearing about since middle school. I never really thought much of it.
It seemed like a ridiculous way to govern a society. It was mostly practiced by terrorist like the Taliban.
Professor Richards enlightened me on the topic of Sharia Law. Professor Richards put me in the shoes of a person who practices Sharia Law.
One can't base your laws on a book that is up to interpretation.
Peaceful men like them are hidden behind the violent headlines. Sharia Law causes violence.
I also felt that it was very redundant and many of the points that the main participants were making weren't really explained or elaborated on.
I felt that, being a listener, I was completely uninvolved in the class. Sam was mostly addressing the people acting out the skit.
This is all the time it took to get through the historical part of the lecture. It left little time to have the class discussion.
I understood the idea behind it. It just didn't keep my interest.
The participants had scripts that they had to follow. I think that it made the debate weaker. It didn't allow them to give their actual opinions on the subject.
As a citizen of America, I was not taught about cultures around the world in my education. Personally, it was terrible hearing Basim's story.
you said that this would be all over the news had it happened in America I believe there would be much more than just news coverage
The things we get angry about, instantly become meaningless trash. we look from Bassims perspective.
Also, I love how this incident didnt cause him to look at all Americans as one.
It made me so angry to sit and listen to the lack of reparations given to Bassim post tragedy.
This could be because members of ISIS do not look like most of America. Much of America does not know much about Islam.
I wonder what it would have been like. The first semester it was taught.
The class forces you to challenge the way you think about things. It has for me.
A class like soc 119 needs to be something that people everywhere get to experience and learn from.
Now that we are in college. It is too late for many peoplel. To gain an opportunity. The important lesson of empathy .
I find it very interesting. We, here in the United States, never hear of things like this happening.
Schools should be shaping the minds of children. Schools should be expanding their horizon. teaching children about things that matter.
I am sure he felt completely numb at first. Something no one could ever think of. Another human being taking away their family. Another human being taking away their home.
He has no anger against America. America had done things to his family. His family did not deserve anything that had happened.
Anger is a strong emotion. It can take over your entire life.
I am happy to have heard that he is not angry anymore. He had realized in his life that his anger was taking over him. It was detrimental to his life.
We have always taken our safety for granted. We were raised thinking that it was a good thing that we were sending troops into Afghanistan. That meant that we were going to be kept safe.
They have no emotional connection to it. It makes them care.
Americans do not recognize their own faults.
It's usually about the terrorist groups in those areas we are trying to take down. It's not the lives of the people who are trying to fix their country.
Our generation could be the one to change the stereotype that surrounds the US media. Tell whole nation what is going on outside of this country.
I agree with everything Hannah said.
There are many people in this world who want to end their lives. They lost everything.
We should use Basim's story to be an example to them. Life is precious.
Take the North Korea issue. It is going on right now.
I realize that such an experiment may not follow a very scientific approach. It is enough to make a point.
Imagine the public does not actively keep the government in check. they are forfeiting a lot of power for a select few humans These few humans will almost definitely act selfishly.
All resulting in a disaster that leads to something like the current situation in the Middle East and its reputation.
His family's death was a tragedy. I wouldn't expect anyone to bounce back easily.
Bassim's words were very inspiring to me. I can't imagine having to continue living on. I am capable of speaking out about it every year.
It comes as no surprise to me the kind of vengeful hatred that is created as an effect of such a taxing war in Afghanistan. Bassim's story was enlightening.
There are people out there who can forgive such destruction. It is a model worldview that the rest of the world deserves to understand.
The world needs to better interpret their religious beliefs. As Bassim has in his life.
Most all religious ideologies around the world support the idea of forgiving your fellow man for their actions, yet there have been wars fought all upon the difference of ideologies.
The first question is one that I have personally been wondering about the citizens of Iraq and Basims answer was inspirational.
Listening to his reasoning. Sounded familiar to my own religion of Christianity. That was touched upon by a student who spoke up in response to Basim's answer.
He mentioned that it sounded similar to other religions beliefs. If everyone practiced what they preached the world would be a much more forgiving place.
I chose this video. I thought this was such a moving part of class.
We are living in Donald Trump America today. people do not realize the consequences of kicking immigrants out of our country. They have lived here all of their lives.
The other part of your post that I thought was good. how you described how he kept going.
Peace was a big part of what Rafi was talking about.
It really makes you see how wrong some people are about the Afghan world.
Divorce is a curveball you can never be prepared for.
I think it would be easier if ou could get divorced in a simpler way. It wouldn't make the process drag out so long.
The divorce just settled fast. I could better acclimate to the new lifestyle changes.
I agree that I am very interested in hearing how the effects of divorce to a person whose parents divorced so quickly like the Quaran says. This is as opposed to my parents divorce who has been a very long and dragged out process.
These countries all only care about what we are willing to do for them. They care about nothing more than that.
They only care about what the impact is on their own country. that president is in charge.
This makes me wonder. The U.S should be trying to help more. We should simply pull out of the country altogether.
It is a hard decision to make. American soldiers are constantly dying in battle over there in an area that often times seems to be running low on hope.
I love how we are learning about things that are actually relevant to our lives. We don't have that disconnect with what is going on around us.
Now I don't really know how to look to far into this. it is odd to me that we tend to, by default, blame religion. We call people crazy. its a religion thats dominant in our area..
It says something about our country. How our brains are wired.
It says something. The way we put blame on others.
Sam explained how he got on Facebook. Sam saw Basims post about how the Americans bombed his house and his brothers house and all of his family members died. My heart dropped.
If the light in your life was taken away. In a second from a miscalculated bomb. Basim and his family did nothing to deserve.
I heard this. My mind was racing a mile a minute. I was just so shocked to hear that.
Sam was going through Basims story. Sam was showing pictures. You could hear a pin drop in the 700 person class.
I said this in my last response. Countries in which we are at war with I find hard to picture as regular developed country. Sam showed me yet again in this video that this is not the case.
We were shown his house, his wife, and his past. I was almost able to establish a great understanding of this man.
I think what is common for people to do is to generalize a whole country to be bad. It is common when countries go to war. It is common when they hear something in the media.
They realized. The soldiers they were killing were just like them. They felt empathy for each other.
Overall, I think people need not to be so quick to assume. They shouldn't think that a group of people who seem different to them are bad.
You're supposed to judge people individually. Off of their character. Doing that don't assume. All people are going to be like them.
Just imagine. Everything you cared about was taken from you all at once.
There are so many innocent casualties of war. That doesn't lessen the suffering that people like Basim go through.
We live in a generation that is numb to violence. That changes once it is on our doorstep.
I can't even imagine growing up in a place like Iraq. It is constantly ravaged by unending warfare.
We wonder why America has so many enemies in the Middle East.
Some victims are bound to be resentful. With their way of life taken away, they have nothing left to lose.
I'm not saying that our actions justify terrorism in any form. Maybe our strategy to oust ISIS is having adverse effects.
I watched the video. How are you not angrier with Americans?
He was extremely sad at first. He was then very angry. Then he realized that the anger wasn't good for him. It was eating him up.
The war on terror has created such a fear in everyone that lives on America. They are unable to forgive. I find it extremely admirable. Bassim is able to forgive after what was done to him.
By the way he describes his country, it seems clear. Corruption is a serious issue in Iraq.
He mentioned he has no hope for the immediate future of Iraq. These two issues are obviously linked.
He speaks of how the U.S. government must fix the problems they have created.
These things lead me to believe. We need a dramatic shift in foreign policy. In the United States.
I do not know exactly how this should be done it is clear that the United States is directly responsible for a lot of the damage in the Middle East we are responsible for the threat of ISIS the United States originally funded and armed them as rebels
For almost two decades, the media would show us the extremes. My entire life, since I can remember things, the media would show us the extremes. Nations are constantly fighting. We think that everyone in that part of the world is like that.
He lead a normal life. He had a house similar to what we have in the States. He shopped in malls that are similar. He had a family he loved.
I learned something important that day. Not everyone there hates the US.
He wanted to do good in this life. he took the initiative to do so.
It's crazy. The media depicts people from the Middle East as savages who live in a war crazed culture.
I have a couple of friends. They were stationed in Mosul. They were to fight against Isis. They were to liberate them from the city.
All of them say the same things like Sam. All of them have had good interactions with most of the people that are left there.
Mosul will never be the same again. Basim mentioned it.
Someone made a mistake on the job. Basim to lose almost everything he held dear.
I worked for a defense company this past summer. They manufactured some of the aircraft used in the military.
The very same vehicles were also causing destruction on innocent lives.
We have been fortunate enough to since then not have major terrorist attacks.
A lot of them are people who used their cars to mow down pedestrians.
A group of protestors were run over by a deranged person.
Sam brings up topics. He asks questions that some people would be uncomfortable to ask. Some people may be afraid to talk about them.
Racial stereotypes, religious views, differing beliefs and other borderline topics that need to be discussed. Nobody will change their ways of thinking. There will be no process towards a more peaceful and equal society.
Americans only see the violence that radical Muslims have created. They are more likely to believe that these extremists come from a bad religion.
Coming back to what Sam says about empathy.
Empathy is the connection between people who believe in a different God.
I agree with you. It is very hard to hear that people are suffering. What America is doing. In other peoples countries.
I have never gotten the chance to speak to someone with such a tragic situation. It relates to something I'm learning in one of my classes.
I can't believe he isn't an angry person. He comes off as we spoke to him in class.
That was the first question that popped into my head. It was one of the first things a student asked him.
It was as if he knew the question was coming. Shook his head before the student could finish asking.
I really agree with everything that you said.
Sam said his line. They are actually elevated, not oppressed.
I never thought about the idea. These women are confident. These women are respectful of themselves. They have the courage to be who they are. not care what others think of them.
This was inspiring to hear. Made me think about the way I view people. Who are different than myself.
I also analyzed this video for my response. I did not discuss the same things that you did.
I talked more generally about how having empathy towards others is so important to make the world a more accepting place. I loved how you discussed the terrorism aspect of this lecture.
I have always struggled with the fact. Marriage is something controlled by the church.
I think for me, it was the picture of the dog that didnt make it that did me in.
Obviously, members of his family passing is horrifically tragic.
I liked what you said about it being a reminder. People need to work together to stop these kinds of conflicts.
I do not think many people can really relate. How he feels with his life. What has happened was truly a tragedy.
I do agree that wars should not be fought this way. It is unhuman to send bombs on innocent humans. They are human just like we are.
Not only by asking the Iraqi people to change their ways are ISIS intruding on their freedom. They are taking over the Iraqi way of life entirely.
Basim used some examples involving clothing, business practices, cultural shifts. things were altered due to the ISIS takeover.
From my understanding. ISIS was a terrorist group that hid away in caves . i had no idea how culturally intrusive they had become.
In America, we view all of our presidents from being different from each other.
They are from different backgrounds. They have different policies. They belong to different politic parties.
American citizens carefully choose their candidate they want to elect. American citizens carefully choose their candidate based on who they think is going to be able to effectively end the conflicts in the middle east.
There is a need to project our ideals on other countries. It leads to insensitivity to the people that live there.
I didn't really think. His story never even made it to the United States.
That is very messed up to think about. His story was probably only one of hundreds.
Imagine hearing every single heart-wrenching story that happened to countries we've involved ourselves in.
This is interesting. We believe that each President has their own values. Basim shows us that this is not true.
Putting faces to the Middle Eastern people. Truly seeing their struggle opened my eyes to how difficult things really are for them.
To which responded by saying something along the lines of how being angry all the time doesn't change the situation.
This point stuck out to me. many times people go through things in life that may change the course of their life. how they respond to it determines how the rest of their life will be.
Coming into college there were many lessons I was taught. I learned how to see the world in a more vivid, colorful light.
I find it commendable that Basim has overcame his anger. What happened to his family.
I am trying to make this about myself. Basim is an inspiration to many who face adversity.
If America faced these same problems. How would we react?
These are the thoughts that ran through my head. That leads me to my next thought.
In turn, our awareness will translate into a more educated society, focusing on the betterment of our relations with other countries.
Basim has demonstrated it. Our anger will only get us far.
His comments about holding anger were very poignant.
I have a feeling that helped him. show us forgiveness tremendously.
Bassim detailed the events that happened to his family. I was traumatized.
I agree. This is everything you said here.
Sam starts the video by talking about how his class has evolved. How it's different every year.
I personally love the story. Sam accidentally converted to Islam. It's so funny.
Sam says how empathy is truly putting yourself in someone elses shoes.
Why do I get uneasy when I see someone with a hijab in an airport?
To simplify the world if you would.
I dont understand why 9 11 happened. 9 11 wasnt caused by everyone whos Muslim. I guess thats where my brain goes astray.
On the top of empathy I feel as though it is a really hard thing to convey.
I really want to start thinking differently than that.
People from other backgrounds talk about where they're from. I find it so interesting.
It is super important to put yourself in other peoples shoes. Try and see things from all perspectives. That is how you can fully understand what is going on.
In order to grow, we need to have empathy. It is crucial for a positive learning experience.
I thought this was a great class to sit in on. Sam had set up a unique dynamic by having the race roles reversed.
It was a great idea to have the roles reversed. Everyone viewing the lecture had the ability to see the raw emotion of the students who were chosen to speak.
I was a little disappointed with how the group took it. felt that it dragged on very long. They kept repeating the same come backs.
I understand the point of repetition. African Americans do hear the same responses repeated over again day in , day out . I feel that everyone should have brought up other points that affect them in their personal lives, like more current day issues.
It would have been great if they expanded upon more issues. This could have brought greater awareness to the audience.
I also feel that other races could have been brought into the mix in the scenario set up in class.
There are many citizens in the Unites States . Who do not fall under the black or white category.
Hearing a real life story of a human being who was directly affected by the war we are in but know nothing about.
The power of forgiveness in this particular situation is something I don't believe we will be expected to fathom. It is admirable from an outside perspective.
It makes me wonder how things might be different. Events like the one that took place at Basim's house were being reported to the U.S people.
The army were forced to admit to the acts they were committing. The army could sweep these atrocities under the rug. The army could act like they were no big deal.
Imagine if they were responsible for being honest with their people. I think there would be less bloodshed.
Many people will always turn a blind eye. Americans knew what we were doing. There would be efforts to lessen the attacks by the U.S. The government wants to look good in our eyes. and wouldn't want the backlash that it isn't receiving by keeping their actions a secret.
That's the only way a change can ever be made.
I also discussed my opinion of this video. We said a lot of the same things!
A lot of people would take the time to do what you did. I believe. We would do a lot of things so much differently.
Its so admirable to be as forgiving as Bassim is!
I love how Bassim was able to confidently speak on his religion. He didn't care who agreed. He didn't care who disagreed.
I am a spiritual person. I believe in God.
I learned it. muslim women have way more rights than we think they do. it was crazy to hear about how they can divorce freely. so many religions that I know here, people just can't go about doing that.
I would be curious to hear what other things your media has taught you about Muslims. A lot of our media sources tend to have this negative connotation about the religion as a whole.
I think. It is the most impressive thing. Basim has not let anger consume his life. He has forgiven what has happened to his family.
Basim lost everything he loved. Basim lost the lights of his life.
I was in Basim's position. I'd have a hard time saying that statement truthfully.
I think that it is the most respectful thing that Basim has no resentment or hate. He loves his American friends still. He does not let the hate of the American government eat him up.
I have the upmost respect for Basim. I think everyone should take a learning lesson from him about opening our minds and hearts. Everyone should take a learning lesson from him to not let anger consume us.
The question was this. In your opinion, do you see any difference between the three United States presidents. These presidents include Bush, Obama, and Trump.
We hear a lot about change. We har a lot about making America great again. Things rarely ever changes from day to day life.
The sentiment is the same. Things are different in Iraq.
Afghanistan and Iraq usually get lumped together. They are thought of basically the same by many Americans (I was guilty of this myself for the majority of my life). These past few weeks have been an excellent way of showing that that isn't the case.
But as Basim said, anger will only eat you alive if it is dwelled upon.
Basim stated. His religion helped him deal with these difficult circumstances.
am a Christian. I would certainly rely on my faith in times ofsteep adversity.
He described how this class is a semester on empathy. It made a lot of sense to me.
I saw lens from a different perspective. it is something I think everyone should experience.
Empathy is an intellectual development. I never thought about it.
Opening yourself up and becoming an empathetic person changes your perspective. Some people who tend to generalize a population, such as Muslims, as being violent. They have not opened themselves up to look through another lens They cannot see the world from someone elses view rather than their own.
Sadly this is what happened to Basim and his family.
I didn't have this viewpoint coming into this lecture. I'm glad to have walked out with a new perspective.
I could not agree more with everything you have said.
Personally, I have lost family members and close family friends.
Basim attributes his ability to forgive to his faith. It is a very familiar standpoint. Many Americans hold it to be true.
How could you not hate something that took your family away?
He spoke about how he felt. his life had been taken away.
This is the case. I am struggling to see how there is no resentment.
I thought it was interesting to hear a first person account. Someone has lost something irreplaceable by our military.
We tend to think of these countries as violent. We associate them too closely with the war. There are real people that live there.
There are families that live there and operate. As our families do in the United States.
That Ifeel would be much more powerful than having to side-step the channel. he message is delivered.
One benefit from this class. Being able to understand other cultures. Being able to understand other religions. Stereotyped as dangerous. and see how they really are.
I was not raised Catholic. I had never experienced the religion much at all. It was a good education, so my parents sent me there.
I was given the opportunity to see first hand. This was something I wanted to believe in.
I was furious. She said this. I was raised in a mostly open family who never mentioned to me. Being gay was frowned upon in religions.
He is not a threat to anyone who is living in the United States.
the Unites States Government decided that bombing his house was somehow beneficial. keeping Americans safe.
I can personally understand if Bassim were to have some sort of hatred towards the American government.
The United States even then offered him a small monetary value as compensation. That is at all of equal value as his families lives.
It is clear after talking to Bassim. That is not the case at all.
Bassim uses his religion to forgive a country. It is full of people who murdered his family in cold blodd.
Religion can do that for a man. Religion has to have some good in it.
Never would I have though I would feel so many emotions in a classroom before.
I chose the video: Introducing Basim Razzo. It was the part of the class that struck me the most.
He had said everything we needed to know. Changed the whole class environment in a couple seconds.
It was that moment. Sam explained what had happened to Basim.
I could hear these words resonate in my head. I could feel them stirring my stomach.
Pictures on the slides of the bombing sites just contributed to the shock. I was already experiencing it.
we saw all those pictures. Basim keep telling us. he had to deal with everything after the disaster
The point in the specific discussion really hit me. Dr. Richards made a point on seeing things from the scopes of other people and religions.
Empathy is something that has been neglected by several White Americans. Who only see things from the way in which they were brought up.
It was so upsetting to realize that we take so many simple things in our life for granted.
I thought that Afghanistan. A war torn country. Nothing really to offer to its citizens.
Basim will unfortunately never be the same. After that day, his life had changed forever.
Sharia is a set of religious principles. Sharia forms part of the Islamic tradition.
Christian sharia is not that any different. Many preaches or religious leaders have specific goals in mind they want to achieve
Facetiming with Basim was very emotional. it opened up many doors to the way I think.
A girl in our class asked why he wasnt angry with Americans after everything that happened.
He has many friends. They are all good people.
His religion tells him to forgive. I thought it was interesting. It was similar to what the past guest speaker, who was Muslim, told us about his beliefs.
I think this is something we should learn from.
Sometimes it is hard to forgive someone for what they did. Listening to Basim, I realized how important it is to forgive.
No matter what religion, it is the right thing to do. it is extremely hard.
The clip I chose was what really stood out to me after thinking about the conversation in class.
I always wondered what reactions of Iraqi citizens are. there is deaths of innocent people at the hands of American military.
seen in the video, the girl asking the question said she would be very angry. that had happened to her.
Basim took us through his emotions when dealing with the tragedy. Basim went on to explain why he doesnt hate American people.
Basim explained that the problem many Iraqi people have with America is with the government.
We should promote the interaction of people from all backgrounds. We should break down barriers we currently have.
I was really taken by surprise. Sam told the story. Sam had him on Skype the whole time.
His story was absolutely incredible. I enjoyed the Skype call a lot.
The question she asked was definitely the one at the top of the list in my mind.
Being born into a war torn flag is a crazy scenario. It is unlike anything that happens in america.
the impact of war weighs heavier on the people of Iraq. it is scary to realize is how distant they are from the dangers that goes around them.
it's a daunting circumstance. I hope it will soon be history not news.
Our world was more empathetic. Half of the problems that occur wouldn't be there in a sense.
People are so quick to judge or make impulsive actions. They even say things impulsively that they can not take back. Maybe some they regret, maybe some they do not.
It is amazing how he does not hate the American people for what happened to his family. It may sound logical on our end. It was probably harder to forgive than to hate.
He also stated feeling angry. It lasted for a few months.
This hate could have prolonged. It could become something worse because of what the American government did to his family.
I appreciate and respect their system. It's very dehumanizing to women. Much more of a patriarchal society. Than what we have here in America.
Forcing a woman, who doesn't want to be in a marriage to stay in a marriage, is oppression, period!
As someone who was raised Catholic I feel for this topic.
This is kind of beside the point you make however.
Its horrible. The Bible taken literally or even out of context can justificate peoples hatred for a race, gender, etc.
Its also kind of funny. if we did interpret it literally, which you would think would be the best way, we would be stoning people to death. We would be completely unprogressive.
In a Class on Empathy. Sam discusses the different ways individuals view people of other religions.
Sam discusses the common conversation. many people today say.
When we look through the eyes of someone else, our whole perspective changes. Our life is sure to be changed.
People need to stop putting the blame on people who are different than them.
Judgements are for uneducated people. They say things that are completely irrelevant to feel better about themselves.
I agree with you. The ability to take the perspective of another. Is an important attribute in life.
Having the ability to do this effectively will allow someone to relate. seeing it from their point of view.
To truly expand my perspective, I would need to travel the world. I would live with people in different countries. I would experience their lives first hand.
We take the perspective of these foreign people. I have previously considered them outsiders it will help to broaden my perception
everyone in the class knew, historically, the events happened the other way around. trying to imagine it being reversed was intended to make the white people in the room think hard. injustices that have been done to Black Americans.
People often have a tendency to think that those of other backgrounds are exaggerating. They fabricate things to try to make themselves seem like the victim. This is rarely is the case.
I was also pretty floored. I heard the statistic about job prospects for white felons vs. uncharged black applicants.
It was absolutely awe inspiring to me to listen to Basim share his story with us in class.
I cannot even fathom living through the tragedy. He survived it.
he survive physically. His soul survived.
It made me start thinking about Americans. The grudges that we hold.
This man literally had everything blown away in one moment. They used the wrong coordinates.
I think that we let that single event influence a lot of our thinking about middle eastern nations.
Im so thankful to have been able to listen to Basim, Raffi, and the US solider talk about their experiences.
It truly has changed my view. That is not what I thought I knew about Islam.
I really appreciated the strength that it took for Basim to speak about the events that happened to him.
If we all tried to live our lives more like Basim. The world would be a better place.
I admire Basim. I have lost very close family members to tragedy.
Sociology 119 is a class made to openly discuss the universal issues happening currently.
Most people feel like we are talking about Islam often. During Lecture.
Sam pointed out this is because Islamophobia is present very openly in society.
The class has a point, The class we all are taking by personal choice this semester. The point is to open up our eyes to the problems of the world.
Empathy is a big value that sociology 199 is trying to imprint in Penn State students for a long time.
why do things the same? a presidents term is over.
I do hope. Someone breaks this cycle.
I agree with you. This was a very eye opening class.
Imagine personally if a U.S solider accidentally killed your family in the hunt for a terrorist.
I think. Everything you are saying is completely right.
Our nation was meant to be a place for religious freedom. Anyone could escape from religious persecution.
Imagine all you ever needed to get there was just to be a good person in life. Why does it matter whether people follow the bible word for word?
They don't take in news from multiple sources. They can make their own informed decisions.
These are questions I'll almost definitely never know the answer to. People like Basim might.
I completely agree with what you are saying here.
I view Afghanistan way more positively than I did a month ago. It is due to these two men.
Basims house was destroyed by Americans. Basims family was destroyed by Americans. He does not hold any animosity toward our country.
I think that is an amazing hobby. You have found love.
I am having the mindset of openness to actually going out I am meeting new people. trying new activities truly makes life more worthwhile.
We have a habit of sugar-coating our history. Present it in a way that favors America.
This does us no favors in growing in solidarity. We have to become a stronger country.
It is almost as if kids are raised in a bubble throughout their education. They then find that the real world is much different than the idealized world they were presented with.
the ability to interpret spiritual writings is very important. we all have different life experiences.
This can be very beneficial. People tend to read things in a way that they benefit from it.
I completely agree with everything you have said in this response.
I personally found this class to be my favorite one thus far.
Ithink that Basim has to be one of the kindest most genuine people I have ever interacted with.
Basim inspired me to really take a good look at my life. I learn to appreciate the relationships that I have.
He has motivated me to get back in touch with my faith
I do consider myself to be a Christian. I don't keep up with my faith as well as I should. Basim was able to learn to forgive the United States for all of the pain that they had caused him. That is what God wants. , then I think that establishing a faith like that is something that I believe will be extremely beneficial to my outlook on what life throws my way.
I did miss class one day on a Tuesday. This is that class.
I chose to watch. The heading really caught my interest.
I kind of laugh at how people from outside of the United States see no difference in the presidents here. It seems that us, Americans, cannot stop talking about the differences.
Many people do not like it. Are constantly bashing him. When compared to the past president.
all the differences between them. they to agree on the corrupt policies that have to do with the Iraqi people.
Prior to this course, if you would mention Iraq people to me I would have ill thoughts towards them because of the war. Now i realize that that isn't the case.
Whites aren't usually pressed when it comes to racism.
I agree with the stance of the invincible feeling of the weather not effecting me personally. It is easy to stand by.
we must take steps, donate, raise awareness to do everything in our power to help.
I can relate to this response. I as well read A Thousand Splendid Sons. I have dealt with divorce from a personal level as well.
However, following this lecture, I will begin to see things from a different perspective. I will be less susceptible to judging.
I come from a Christian home. I sometimes neglect to see other cultures eye to eye. I am involved in only my practices.
I tend to be someone to hold grudges. I tend to get angry. This would have ruined me.
This is something I think many people struggle with. He understood this is a war against governments, not people. It can be a hard concept to grasp.
This tells you that the world around us is constantly evolving. That means we can talk about various issues and topics each year.
I see him as having so much strength.
It would be extremely hard for anyone to forgive and not be angry. It was caused by an enemy.
It opened my eyes to a lot. It made me think more critically about the way we see the world.
I found it inspiring how Basim said he doesnt hate America. it shows how kind and genuine he is.
I think that if I were in his position, it would be hard for me to accept America as a whole.
I was able to see who Basim really is. We had a short conversation with him.
I always believed that it was different. I never really bothered to look in to it.
After realizing that Bassim and his family lived a life very similar to mine, I thought to myself that if that happened in the United States, it would be all over the news.
The most amazing thing that I saw that day was how forgiving Bassim was.
Forgiveness is I think something that takes courage. Forgiveness is not easy for some people to do.
Most religions hold the same common moral and human values. Religions should not be discriminated against because of the few bad nuts in each.
I never find a person so willing to accept many different religions. he also said he was willing to be called an atheist.
I am so perplexed by how it is someone could live by so many different mantras.
I am curious how a Islamic person would feel. He claimed to be Islamic. He was in a mosque.
To travel there and experience something like a culture or a religion. In the most complete way possible. In my opinion the only way. One could even consider calling themselves. someone from another religion.
I agree with everything you are talking about.
After all the reading videos we watched for class, it opened my eyes to how similar we are to other countries.
Thinking of some other countries, we automatically think of war, terrorism, etc.
I feel we Americans are so closed minded to life in other countries. I feel we Americans have opinions about them. In reality we know nothing about them.
We have so much to be thankful for. We can only hope such horror won't be seen in our country one of these days.
China had massive wars. Genocides every 50 years.
China engaged in war with Russia and Japan often. Would you have guessed more people died?
Life is suffering.
We need to compare the past of our environments with others. We are truly going to dislike America.
It's really atrocious that we have to work to get unbiased legitimate news. its nearly impossible to get news about things like that which happened to Basim.
Sam Richards is right. The military is to protect us. The military is also a business.
Another country came to America for our natural resources. We would not allow that.
I was wondering the same thing that Stacy asked. She asked him how is he not angry with the United States.
His religion believes in forgiveness. That's what he did.
We never get to hear personal stories such as Basim's. listening to his story made me feel completely awful.
I found this topic very interesting too. I felt like it was very different from the way it is here in America.
The whole money aspect of the divorces confuse me. It was interesting learning more about that topic.
I thought it was a strange thing. Despite being divorced, the father still has to provide for the children.
Like Ilana said, it makes sense. The mother will not be completely on her own to take care of the children.
I would've snapped. I don't know if I would've ever been able to be my original self again.
But I really enjoyed the parallel you drew between the Muslim religion and Christianity.
I think. This is something that is too often overlooked by Americans.
I think that a lot of these stereotypes come from what we think about the Taliban, 911, etc.
A bad people come together with these radical ideas. Should not reflect on a nation in its entirety.
I think as a country we continue to take two steps forward and then two steps back. no matter what there is some sort of racism or at least negative stereotyping of other cultures religions countries.
Is an act only terrorism if its done against US citizens?
Is it only considered terrorism? The perpetrator does it in the name of Allah.
There's something to be changed in our morality. It can only truly be reached through dialogue.
When Donald Trump came into office, his plan to bring troops back into Afghanistan. his plan has been under some scrutiny.
The government is still not the best. People were doing what they can to stay alive.
I do understand. It can be hard to get the laws of the country changed. It can be hard to get the policies of the country changed. It seems as though no President has taken action to do so.
The media makes it seem. Recent presidents such as Obama were solving problems in the middle east. What we see as a problem may be different than what Basim sees as a problem.
I think that Americans believe they are more involved in other countries than they are.
The class later learns through skyping Basim. He has very little resentment towards the United States.
He said he believe god chose him to survive to move forward. He further achieve his goals in life.
So it was good for the class to see a different way of perceiving things.
I personally loved the stories that Basim shared. I loved the personal reactions he presented to us.
It is an unspeakable tragedy. Bassim cannot realistically foresee the children living in a better, safer Iraq. He cannot see a better one than the one he has been subject to for decades. Bush and Clinton politics are not anything new.
Still, I wonder. The United States does not intervene. Who will save the Iraqi people from another brutal dictator?
Bassim struck an important chord with me. The point was that Iraq's true problem is corruption.
This contributes to the bleakness that permeates Bassims vision of Iraq in the future.
I could not imagine what it would be like to lose almost everyone you love. At the hands of another country. For no reason.
He lives his life with hope. He is thankful for what he has. He does not go around spreading hate and anger.
I heard Bassim speak and tell his story I almost could not believe it was a true story everything he went through and how he was treated was completely unacceptable
It astonishes me that he has the fortitude to continue to live his life the way he does. if I were in his position I do not think I would be able to be as calm as he is.
I would never let that go. I would never forgive the people . They caused me that sort of pain.
Basim said that at first, after the accident he was angry. Eventually he realized that the anger was hurting him more than it was benefiting him.
Basim was able to forgive Americans over probably the biggest devastation he will ever experience in his life. I think that is truly inspiring.
Look at what happened to Basim's family, as a result of Americans. It's something that I myself can't imagine every being able to forgive.
He was able to forgive the people that caused his home to get bombed. He move on to a more tranquil stage of his life.
It honestly gives me hope. Some people can understand. The know you shouldn't generalize about a whole group of people. You can't generalize because a few did something evil.
I appreciate that we were able to directly communicate with him. It was an interesting learning experience.
One thing thats important that we can take away from that lesson though was that you can't come to hate an entire group of people for the wrong doings of a few people.
The numbness and disconnection from the rest of the world would've been so isolating any man would be at the edge.
So for Bassim to be able to make it out of that numb stage alone is no small feet at all. to be able to make it out of that numb stage is an incredible achievement.
However, Bassim got passed that as well.
He did not even bother to talk about it. He immediately talked about his forgiveness.
That last one is arguable. The story we are told of the Revolutionary War and Civil war. Do not match up quite to the reality.
It's more of a war about the fear of slaves being freed. The South seceded.
I was again surprised. I found many statistics.
The American soldier was not alone. 63 percent of young Americans are unable to find Iraq on a map according to the National Geophic Societys Roper poll.
The same survey also found that 75 percent of Americans could not find Israel or Iran.
I wonder. One of the richest and most powerful countries in the world struggles so much with world geography.
Bassim Razzo advice to the class. Brought up a good point. Which made me a bit scared.
The geographical barriers which created social barriers are becoming increasingly irrelevant as technology advances.
The media uses that term immediatelywhen a Muslim commits an act of crime.
These individuals also usually consider themselves to be devout Christians.
Basim was one of those innocent people whose home was destroyed.
When Sam showed us the pictures of his beautiful home and family before the mistaken bomb struck his home I felt sympathy for him.
He lost his wife, daughter, brother, his nephew, and his dog. He forgave.
So many innocent people die daily. the public chooses to show what they think is important. they ignore the causalities of the minorities.
I think that this is very clear in your response. You conveyed it with great detail and sympathy. That's especially true when you mentioned that the American bashing should stop. The discussion of American history should be a lesson for future generations. previous mistakes in a sociology lecture should be a lesson for future generations.
No one should have to go through what Bassim has had to go through in his life.
The unfortunate part about the entire situation. There are more people. In a similar position and situation as Bassim. No one knows about.
How can you take so much from a person, acknowledge you made a mistake, and then refuse to help that person?
We might be from different places. We live in different countries. We are all human beings.
His explanation made perfect sense. He showed the strength and faith he had in his life.
He realized something. Without forgiveness he wouldn't be able to continue living his life.
The anger, the emotions, the shock he felt was crippling. Causing him to diminish the opportunity. He had since his life was spared.
Basim mentioned that. I automatically understood what he meant.
Something that I think was surprising to a majority of the class was the actions the United States government had taken.
There was no justice. Accountability for our actions. Which is all Basim desires.
It’s a scary thought to think that people who are supposed to protect us can be the ones who are most careless.
It makes me feel sadness for the pain that he went through. It could've easily been avoided. If the United States had been more careful.
I, like many other people. Thought that these women were oppressed. By the men in their culture.
I liked what one of the girls said about how wearing a hijab lets you behave more freely. You're thinking less about your appearance. More about the experiences you have.
I think we need to have more lectures like this one. It shows the importance of conversation. How they help break common assumptions.
I feel like I do not think about this kind of thing enough. I wonder if it is our fault.
it seems like our country tends to avoid reporting on such gruesome and tragic stories.
His response is what truly caught my attention.
He was always taught to forgive. Very few people would handle it the way Basim did.
If more Americans spent time in Iraq I feel major changes could be made. If more Americans met people like Basim I feel major changes could be made.
I have rarely met citizens outside the United States. Let alone the country we are at war with.
I knew there were innocent people like Basim being affected by this war. To actually see it in person was what really made the war a reality.
Therefore, change can only be made one person at a time. If all learn to forgive the way Basim did, then there is a chance the world can be a better place again.
The Reason being that we are looking at the wrong end of the problem .
He states that it is absolutely important to view other cultures from their perspective.
Black people are not darker in skin color. They are less evolved. Closer to primate ancestors.
This is a level of grace that cannot be said for a lot of Americans here.
I always thought that we have every right to get involved in the war.
Don't get me wrong. I still feel that we needed to react with some type of action. We need to drop a bomb for the loss that we, Americans, faced on September 11th.
Not all Americans support the war. It certainly wasn't all of our decisions to do what we did. I sure hope that he doesn't hate all of us in America.
I really respect his efforts of living a life in peace. I think that many others should give it a try too.
Mr. Razzo begins by discussing the changes ISIS brought to his home city of Mosul.
It is really inspiring listening to people like Razzo. Talk about their experience living life in a war.
It is a perspective that most of us have not and will not ever experience in our lifetimes. Which makes it that much more important to hear. A man who went through this suffering first handedly.
Maybe that's the problem. Some people don't know the distinction.
Some people who commit heinous acts and justify it with their religion actually believe what they're doing is good.
People only focused on the good. We could only hope we'd see better outcomes.
Many people stereotype. Many people don't understand how similar we are.
Media only shows us the violence that some Muslims have created. The media makes us believe that is how they all are.
The opposite can apply as well. Muslims only saw all of the hate Christians perform. They would not have very good images of us as well.
I agree with you. People should set aside their judgment. We would be able to create empathy between each other.
I like how you bring up the conversion from Christianity to Islam. There is so much acceptance for other people's views. You can take them home with you. You can practice something from a different culture.
We don't always get to see the other view point. It is so hard to relate. Sam makes it pretty easy to see the other side. Sam make it easy to really embrace it.
I like how you highlight. People bring up radical islam. There is little said about Christians.
When these bad things happen in the U.S. with religious people it is immediately disassociated with the religion. Instead it's just inherently awful person.
Everything that happens in our country always seems like its the most important thing in the world. In reality there are so many other things going on in the world.
The only issues we seem to hear about from other countries are major events. they come nowhere near to grasping the reality of the situation in foreign nations.
It is almost like they never left the United States. they do the same things they would do at home.
I too couldn't help notice the similarities that Basim has to a typical family here in the United States.
That could not be more wrong
I believe that class really opened my eyes when regarding loss of life from war. I believe that class really opened the eyes of everyone in that class when regarding loss of life from war.
It's easy not to think about death from war. the casualty numbers are usually high. casualty numbers are made up of people we do not know personally.
However, stories like Basim's make everyone realize that if people die in war, real families are affected deeply by their losses.
Why did you think they were all terrorists?
This post is so interesting to me. I think we need to understand why people believe what they do.
Coming from a very chaotic country as is Venezuela. I cannot bring myself to forgive the people from the government. That has brought my family, friends and fellow Venezuelans so much pain.
I think we can all agree that his story is an inspiration to all of us. it helped us learn that we can always move forward. We can overcome whatever we are going through. We can look for peace elsewhere.
You see a specific example of the ramifications of the US's involvement in Iraq. It really gives you a new perspective on the war.
I never really imagined ordinary working class people. Those you would find in the US. Who were just trying to get. Who were not greatly concerned with religion.
This video shows us a man who seemed to be very well off.
I think the reason for this and the media's depiction of Iraq, is to maintain support for the war.
We aren't shown the Muslims who live like we do.
I think that it is often forgotten . The realization comes of what happens after the war?
Families living in these war-torn countries must decide between leaving their home (if they are able to) or stay and hope that their family and property isn't destroyed.
It was beyond hard to hear Basim's answer to the question of if he thinks Mosul or Iran will ever be the same.
Many countries have come from the ashes of war. The Middle East has been affected in a way that almost does seem irreversible.
This is a realization. Not everyone comes to. A tragedy.
He states that he does not have hatred for any American. All he witnessed was the good.
Even in tragedy, some can still find the good in the world.
We should all take a lesson from him. Let go of our anger. Over things that are less significant.
Basim responded by revealing that with Muslim traditions, he forgives America despite the loss of his family and his home in Iraq.
The best option based on his religious beliefs was to forgive America.
Barely having a father figure in my life took a toll on me growing up. He and I stopped talking for five years.
We made amends. I feel so much better.
Granted, its fine to be angry. Its not healthy to hold on to that anger for so long. Forgiveness is key.
I think about them in my head. common association include those extremists groups that are doing terrible things to people all the over the world at the moment.
Most people would be angry and would naturally want revenge, despite their religion, for a tragedy like his. Basim keeps that peaceful mindset which is truly admirable.
I can not say I've been through what he's gone through. I can sympathize with him.
We should show some sympathy with these other people that are going through these things because of our country. we shouldn't believe the media like all Muslims are terrorists.
This phrase is not always physically impossible. It's mentally, extremely challenging.
Getting to know someones personality and mannerisms. Can give you a sense of who the person is. How they deal with things.
Despite physical appearance, you can sometimes find many similarities between you and someone else by just learning a little more about them and maybe asking a few questions.
Doing this can help you become more of an open-minded person. By doing this your views on the world and others will change.
I cannot fathom how much it takes to not hate the people that killed your family. I can not comprehend how much it takes to be understanding.
This man understands that it was not all of the American people that did this to him.
This translates to how Americans think about other people.
It took one group of people to change the way we think about their race of people.
I think that fear is a divisive tool. It can prevent even the best intentioned people from feeling empathetic towards another human being.
Sometimes it feels as if the media works to fuel fear about certain religious groups like Muslims. The media downplays acts of christian violence. The media talks about them as if they are outliers - isolated incidences. The media refrains from using language relating to terrorism. even when christians commit acts of terror.
I appreciate that Sam describes this class. Sam teaches the class on empathy.
Sam tackles hard subjects gracefully. He talks about homeland security after 9 11. He talks about the military operations that the United States has taken.
I think. That's a result of growing up in a closed community. By a community, I do not mean your neighborhood.
Imagine the caretaker incorporated an open-world policy of acceptance and empathy similar to that of Sam's TED Talk. the world would not only be better informed but a better place.
To circumvent this, Sam humanized Basim's life.
Sam demonstrates that the Iraqis were living life normally before the war. their lives were not so different from you and I's.
The normal life that most Iraqis lived changed so dramatically.
Downtown Mosul is a fragment of the bustling city it used to be.
I would feel angry and demand an explanation at first. That would change to worthlessness and lost hope.
He has forgiven the Americans who did this. That is unfathomable to me.
Would someone have put a stop to the madness?
Clear problems exist throughout their culture. The government seems to never change anything.
There are many governments throughout the world that are full of corruption. There are many governments throughout the world that are unable to change. There are many governments throughout the world that are just unbothered by the fact that there are many problems that impede those living in their society.
Thankfully, I am part of a government that cares about their people. It doesn't seem like we care about other people.
Being selfish in this case. Isn't entirely a bad thing. Trumps a government that is corrupt. Uses their people to propel themselves forward.
I would not be able to walk in his shoes at all. Like you said, I would constantly be seeking revenge. I already can't live without my family. If that happened, I don't know what I would do. it would constantly haunt me day and night.
I agree with what you said. The bombings and horrible acts of war committed was the U.S. Government not the people.
I talk to many Americans. They have such pride in this country.
I do not think that most people really know much about what is going on with the United States involvement with the Middle East.
I have heard statistics about the number of civilians the U.S. armed forces have killed. Talking to someone affected by it makes it much more real.
I hope awareness can be raised. As a country we can do better.
So all people who want to achieve their goal of going to heaven or reach god must partake in a set of steps to achieve that goal.
Anyhow both will lead to lack of human progress in life.We can fight this sets of ideas that happen to be extreme, regressive or ultra conservative.
I was sitting in class. I had the same thoughts.
It is a tragedy that this happens regularly. Bringing more troops in will not solve the problem.
This is why communication is important. Individuals can understand that not everyone is a stereotype.
It is almost unfathomable to even make one step towards forgiving the people and the flag. They took away your loved ones.
Bassim is a better person than the rest of us. For defining what it means to be strong and brave.
His forgiveness is given in the hopes. something good will come out of all this evil, death and suffering.
Bassim taught a classroom of college kids. Lessons we would never get otherwise.
I think. It is truly amazing. Bassim forgives America for what was done to him.
His faith is strong. He can use it to guide him to forgiveness.
Bassim lived in America for a little while. He had the opportunity to experience the average American male.
I wonder whatit would be like if many Americans had the chance to go live there. Experience the average Muslim man.
I also thought it was interesting to hear Basim share his story with us.
No one should ever have to go through the tragedy. He experienced. Listening to him talk about what he went through in front of 500 strangers was very inspirational.
he declines this recommendation. he has two daughters to keep in mind.
What motivates this man to put his life on the line every day?
It takes a mature and influential type of person. Chase after his or her dream of peace. Ignoring the potential restrictions.
I feel inspired that his understood encouragement by his people of Afghanistan . Compels him to continue to fight against the people who wish harm.
The statements he makes are all valid. I think they are worth being noted.
Bassim opens up about the schooling around us. It really begins to open my eyes.
He stated. He believes there is a significant lack of geography in our teaching.
I completely agree with this statement. I feel like even myself would like to know more about geography.
I like this video a lot. He brings up American media.
We should take his advice. Try to avoid the media. Avoid the negative media.
Fight off that last detail. There's much to cover.
Eventually, they'll turn on each other. They'll always be thinking about how their own selves are going to survive.
Lots of times in history including social-psychology experiment teach this about human nature.
the worst parts of Christianity or insert whatever religion here were to have a total reset in their community However, if the worst parts of Christianity or insert whatever religion here were to have a total reset in their overall religion, it would drastically change the world for the better.
We want a class about empathy. Other than learning the histories of other backgrounds. We should consider defining our own values as individual humans.
Listening to Bassim speak about forgiveness and moving on. Gave me perspective of the culture of the afghan people. Who populated the warzones our own military fought at.
I have the utmost respect for him. I respect that he lets his religion guide his everyday decisions.
I am so lucky. I was able to witness this interview in a classroom setting.
He had his entire life change in an instant. An American bombing that hit the wrong location.
We have been fortunate to not have any wars in our country. I dont think we truly understand what it is like.
The media portrays us as the best country in every situation. It may not always be true.
My final thoughts have to do with the reason. We got involved with Iraq in the first place.
It makes sense. They could have been monopolizing the prices. I feel like those issues couldve been resolved without any violence and killing.
Basim was asked about his thoughts on seeing Mosul return to a normal way of life in the future. He answered with a resounding no.
The people of Mosul must continue to fight back. The rest of the area that is involved with ISIS must continue to fight back. Show the rest of the world what they believe their real image should be.
We never ask questions. People that we may not understand.
All in all, I really like your call for discussion. It would alleviate many pressures we face today.
The random connection that Basim and Sam made after his TED talk became popular is a great story by itself. Basim's experience and attitude is even more incredible.
I can't imagine losing seemingly everything in an instant the way that Basim did.
By the end of Sam's slideshow, I was feeling angry on behalf of Basim. I was imagining the rage he feels towards the United States.
It was crazy. It was surprising. Seeing him just appear on the screen. Seeing him talk to us about his life since then.
I'm still not really sure what the answer is. I don't know the terms of a solution for military conflicts like Iraq in the Middle East. I do think that we should be allowing more people to have interactions with people like Basim. It would go a long way towards building understanding between cultures. and nations.
To hear from him first hand was absolutely devastating. To listen to him describe his loss was absolutely devastating.
I agree with what you said. How our governments actions should not reflect. All of the American people.
I agree with you. The American government should create some type of organization. That will help those wrongly affected in the Middle East. Like Bassim.
Every day I hear news about the United States and the role that it plays in the world. I hear news about the United States and the role with the current war on terror in the greater Middle East.
I find that often Americans hear news of radical terrorists who threaten to destroy the United States. There is another side of the news that very rarely gets reported.
The machinery used nowadays is much more advanced. The tactics involved are much sneakier.
That is why Basim's family was the target of an accidental bombing.
Basim does not hold any malice towards Americans. He realizes we are not our government.
He said living with hate would get him nowhere in life. He said it would make going on without his loved ones harder...
This slave trade not only targeted a specific ethnicity of people. With a specific religion. Did not enslave any Muslims within this system.
This could be a decent retort. The Islamic peoples of the Middle East did not first raid Spain, killing thousands of Christiansfirst.
He explains how he feels comfortable labeling himself as basically any belief. I believe it enables him to touch on any subject revolving around those religions.
Sam used a great example. People are quick to judge another religion. Sau Muslims are violent people. Acts that have been carried out by a few.
It is ignorant to think of oneself as above others. the reasons for seeing them as lesser can be applied to oneself as well.
It is hard to say what is right and wrong with religion. No one really knows.
Everyone who is some type of religious. Will defend what they know. There are so many knowns.
Christianity itself is split into different branches for a reason.
Most of society connects it to the radicals who act in violence rooted in their faith of God.
There will never be just one way to interpret religion. Society for some reason is still not in tune with that. Society is ready to call out the bad for some, while never really seeing the good.
When Basim saidhe didn't see change throughout the different administrations I was surprised and disheartened.
I heard Basim speak. I felt powerless.
I realize there is no recipe for change. It seems like in today's media landscape it's impossible to get certain stories to be heard.
He felt numb. He didn't know how to feel. It was surreal.
Razzo could easily be one of the most justifiably angry individuals in the world. Somehow he manages to keep his anger from getting the best of him.
Isis serves us the constant reminder. HIstory repeats itself in different terms.
As long as there are religious differences, humanity will continuously endure these extreme wars.
Interference such as foreign interests in money definitely fuel the fire. Oil deposits definitely fuel the fire. Opposing extreme religious views are the key driver.
The specific video that I am going to talk about is the one where my classmate asks Basim how he isnt angry at America.
It made us realize. the people that we hear about getting killed over seas, are real people.
Everyone had empathy for him. We know him.
It wasnt like I didnt know this kind of stuff was happening over there.
I felt it more. I was talking to someone who had been through such tragedy that was caused by something he had nothing to do with.
Basim said that he was angry at first. Not so much anymore.
He said that it isnt America that he should be mad at but our government.
The way that people think practically revolves around the government.
If I was Basim, I would not fuck with anything that comes out of America.
We get very wrapped up in the wars that we are fighting. We only look at the extremists. We only pay attention when something big enough happens. It gets news attention.
It seems incredibly unfair to me. We are on two different sides of the war. We are this military superpower that has gone into these countries. Therefore we don't suffer the day-to-day civilian casualties. they experience in these other countries.
He told the story in this video It was about the kids circling the soldiers with the incense Them getting shot for that is appalling to me.
I understand that countries have lots of traditions. it seems somewhat implausible to ask all the soldiers to learn all the customs of a country.
If we had to fight wars on our land. Rather going to other places and invading them. The United States would be a lot more cautios. About going to war with other nations.
Realizing the impact we are having on foreign civilians could help the United States have a better reputation in the world. Realizing the impact we are having on foreign civilians could prevent the further damage to civilians.
American soldiers returned home. American soldiers were treated as an enemy.
Well he clearly mentions that Christians do the exact same thing. One here talks about it.
Imagine we teach the youth early about the lessons in empathy. They'd see the world in a different perspective. we have a chance at achieving a world of peace.
He soon realized. his anger was eating him alive
It was not the American people that he hated.
Appalled that the American government could be cruel. To look over the lives of many innocent civilians. The sake of war.
We are lucky to be able to take a class. We can connect with people from all over the world.
Sam made an interesting point about how people never say this about radical Muslims.
This is because America is mostly Christian. Many people fail to recognize the connections between Christianity and Islam that Sam points out in class.
If you suggested such an opinion to an American adult. They would probably attack your viewpoint. On all fronts.
I am not much of a guy of faith. that is primarily because of how vague, incomplete and yet rigid some religious texts and guidelines can be.
They can never be used to successfully run a society. many people who have experienced prosperity from the separation of the church with state, might want to unify them once again.
And whatever privilege they may want or achieve because of whatever group they call themselves part of, wont last long. They will be left to deal with harsher consequences, in my opinion.
What Bassim said was extremely heartfelt.
The United States destroyed his home and family. He is not angry with the United States. He is rather disappointed in our government.
His forgiveness stood out to me. Here in the United States, we hold a grudge against Muslims for what happened during 9 11.
There's one key thing to take from Bassim. That's not to hold onto the anger within us.
We have to forgive. We have to let it go. We do nothing withholding all of the anger within us.
Bassim's family got torn apart. He found a way to forgive.
It takes a lot. It's hard for one person to forgive such a crime.
Makes me feel disgusted about America.
Not too long ago there was a Muslim ban for our protection. Why would we need protection from a group of people that follow a particular religion.
Last week, I was in my SOC 119 lab. We were talking about how President Trump. Put the ban on Muslim people.
Yes, 9 11 was caused by a radical group who claimed to be Musllim. That does not mean that every Muslim person is evil, untrustworthy, or a terrorist.
Not that people want to purposely discriminate against them. Some people actually are triggered by Islamic people. It is not accurate.
We tend to judge Islamic people more.
I listened to Sam tell the tragic story of his friend. He really pulled me in that day.
Hearing the story of Basims loss of his loved ones. Seemed like a story that was too sad to be real.
I remember how much my heart dropped. I remember when I first saw his face.
This man had lost almost everything. He was spending his day talking to us. Nothing but smiles.
Basim never thought he would lose his family that morning. Basim's family were so close to him.
To me, forgiveness is one of the biggest lessons to learn in life. It seems that Basim really has this figured out.
I look back. I think about all of the times I have forgiven somebody. None of those times are on such a great scale as Basim forgiving what happened.
He is able to recognize. not all American citizens are to blame for his tragedy. it is the government
He says. His religion teaches him to forgive. Christianity also does the same.
I believe forgiveness is something. people should learn to value and practice it more often.
I was thoroughly intrigued by the video “A Class on Empathy”. I thought that it was a lecture that needed to be vocalized.
White Americans, will state that KKK members are somewhat separated from the Christian faith. They clearly express their loyalty to their religion.
He's also correct in stating that empathy is the key to intellectual maturity and growth.
I hope that this lecture has opened the mind of at least one person in class. Every bit helps.
This reminds me of the pen-pal system. Most of us had a pen-pal system in middle school or elementary school.
It is really awesome. Sam and Bassim are able to do this frequently.
Hearing this guy speak. Has been nothing but intriguing to me.
God forbid that there is ever a war on US soil. US soldiers fighting overseas should pull enough attention towards US citizens.
The world we live in today is extremely selfish.
He sent pictures. They were worth more than 1000 words.
I found his assessment of the status of Mosul to be exceptionally accurate. Basim spent 8 years living in the United States.
Basim did briefly talk about the fighting. It has forced his people into this war-like atmosphere.
I have read this book as well. I feel as though there is so much I do not know about the afghani people.
The book you speak of is excellent. I enjoyed reading it very much.
I have not read any of Husseini's other works. After reading this I feel inclined to do so.
Look on the other hand. There are obviously many parts of life. Some can not necessarily be understood through books.
Books are a good way to make yourself cultured. I still believe. It is important to travel as well to try and fully understand another's culture.
To hear someone say that their country has turned for the worst. Their country will likely not improve anytime in the foreseeable future. It is a bit out of the ordinary for a middle class white kid to hear.
recently I have realized. Maybe it should.
Personally I am not a Donald Trump supporter. He has done what he said he would do from the beginning.
Those people are evil. Unless we kill them I really don't see what is going to stop them from killing us.
We need to continue to bomb them. I feel it is the only way to save innocent lives.
I wish there was another more peaceful way to handle the war that seems inevitable. I think that war might be the only solution.
This lecture was a very powerful one. I definitely will not forget it.
The part when Sam flipped the story caught my attention as well.
The little things that Americans complain of these days probably seem like nothing to some Afghans because of what they have to go through on a day to day basis.
I personally take my safety for granted. I should keep in mind how lucky I am to live in this country.
We aren’t being forced to memorize formulas or vocabulary. We get to learn about important things in our society. I love it.
I think that part of it is because in the past 10 years. We hear more about terroirism led by Muslims. Than any other religious violence.
I think that empathy is valuable. It is about interacting with other people, not just religion.
Without empathy it's difficult to see. One person's religion is no better, no worse, than another person's religion.
I guess. That is part of the reason. We have different denominations in the first place.
They are unable to differentiate between radical Muslims. They are unable to differentiate between Muslims who call Iraq home.
They see no difference between the Muslims who want war and the ones who want peace.
I cannot even fathom waking up one day with everything I have ever known taken away from me. I can't fathom not holding resentment towards the nation responsible. I can't fathom not resenting the body of people who were responsible for it.
Here's what Sam talks about. Muslims are now labeled as terrorists by the US citizens. It's because of a group of ISIS terrorists. They're running around terrorizing a small part of the world.
We realize how we are not different. This will all resolve.
I don't think so.
I believe we are different. we will always look at someone differently. we are not them or I am not you.
This is because if I call ISIS Muslim I am basically implying all muslims act like ISIS. This is completely wrong.
Iraqis don't understand America. Americans don't understand Iraq.
If every single person on the planet understood and believed in that, there would be virtually no conflicts.
That seems to be a far resolution granted there are violent military actions completed day to day.
They lead to a lot of hate and tension towards them. not all muslims are like that.
In the past christians had wars, which took many lives. There are certain groups that proclaim Christianity.
People have to give each other a chance before they assume. The world is to get better and improve.
I know not to characterize all muslim as bad. They are all not. People like Muhammed ali, Malcom x , and so on were muslim but good people. We must learn to put our negative stigmas of people asides.
SO what does the United States do?
The US is determined to fight terror abroad.
It is scary to think of the sort of destruction. he United States is capable of such destruction abroad.
LIke you, I attended Catholic school my entire life. I can see exactly where you are coming from.
I was taught. The Bible is the only way we should live our lives.
We are allowed to follow what we truly believe in. We do not follow what others interpret as the right way.
He was able to forgive Americans for bombing his family. I feel it is time as a society we start accepting others as individuals. We shouldn't see them as an entire religion.
That was the only thing left for him. It is amazing that he was able to find peace with this.
The Quran is not a very big book. The Quran is used to make a whole set of laws. It's probably impossible in such a short book. There are many issues nowadays.
There are different levels. The Muslims interpreted the Quran.
There are some Muslims that probably take it to the extreme. Does not mean that all of them do.
The U.S. government should have compensated Bassim much better. Consider the amount of damage they did to his dwelling. Not to mention his own family!
Sam was telling the story. I felt distant.
I vividly remember how I felt when Sam said So now we're going to meet Basam.
How would we feel if that happened?
It is too sad or inhumane. So why do these cruel war acts continue to be done?
Hearing Basim's story was very eye opening to me.
He lost so many things he loved. For what reason?
I really understand a lot about empathy. I feel sad because I think our idea of war is all wrong.
These lifestyles are the identities that differentiate ourselves from one another.
You bring up how similar we actually are. You imply 'if only the hostile ones saw that'.
That's why humans. Differentiate themselves from others.
I feel like there could have been so many other ways to handle the issue.
Basim had his whole life change due to an American mistake. we need to accept responsibility.
PTSD is another issue that comes from war.
I thought it was interesting. How you included the media portraying war as glorifying.
I agreed with what you were saying.
The media makes it look like everyone that believes in this one religion is violent.
When in reality it is just a different way of looking at the world and morals.
Religion isn't something that you were born with. It is a concept.
Someone's religion shouldn't deter them. Being a good person.
When Sam initially started talking about Basim as any other normal person, I kind of blanked out. I almost saw it as something unimportant.
The slide came up about Basim’s house. It peaked my interest.
He was just so quick to forgive.
He just seemed like such a wholesome person. I just did not think he deserved something like that.
It is wrong to disturb someone's life that way. They have no fault whatsoever.
All we need is a different perspective. Different perspectives shed light on our troubles. Different perspectives put our troubles in their places of importance.
It is stories like his that make us reevaluate what is and is not important in our lives We should reevaluate what we should be concerning ourselves with.
We should follow his example of forgiveness and compassion to others. They have wronged us.
I was touched. He stated. He believes God saved him for a reason.
The reason is to show us a different perspective. It guides us toward a better life path.
The news companies in America are trying to make profits. The news companies in America have to report on what people are going to watch.
What it does is show Americans that these terrorists are bad people. that can lead us to think everyone there is bad, which is not true.
Even to the point where they would vacation together. They helped him move past what happened.
I thought this was kicking a man when he was down.
I was hearing this in class. All I could think was, "How dare they?"
People needed to know what is happening in his country. He saw the opportunity of learning from other countries.
I always thought it was dumb. Someone could tell someone else. They won't go to heaven because of their sexuality.
Religion has always been something I had trouble getting behind.
I like how he compared Sharia Law to Christian Sharia.
When you look at what both religions prohibit. If you want to get in heaven. They are basically identica.
That really made me think about how I go about forming an opinion on someone else's religion.
I was under the impression prior to this class. I thought Christianity and Islam were two totally different religions.
I think that could have been. It was how I was getting my information.
Look at the bones of these religions. I am living a life of a Good Christian. I could be living a life of a Good Muslim.
I agree with exactly the same point that youre trying to make.
If you were to talk to someone in the military who has spent a substantial amount of time over in these areas. Youd get a much better view of how the vast majority of people over there are just the same as us.
Those examples do not represent what the faith is about. Speaking to someone who is Muslim will educate people the correct way. Speaking to someone who is Muslim will help them better understand.
Imagine if the KKK organized a killing. Imagine they named it after Christianity. Many Christians would claim that has nothing to do with their religion. They would discredit the KKK's actions.
Some Jewish men grow out long sideburns. They dress in formal clothes daily. They wear Yamikas.
No one ever thinks of these people being oppressed.
I feel that the only one a woman could be oppressed by wearing a hijab. If she wants to not where one is being forced against her will to do so. THis is not the case a majority of the time.
This example really resonated with me. I feel as though I never really stepped back. I never tried to see other cultures from a point of view other than my White, Christian, American view.
I was also raised Christian. I would not consider myself a religious person.
I agree. There were aspects to this class that could have been improved in some ways. I did learn some things about the black experience in America. I didn't know before.
The gangs in the US do not operate by the blessing of the church. Gang members are not lured into the gangster life by using religion.
It is as important to condemn the ideology propagating these attacks. Islamic leaders have failed to condemn. Islamic leaders must be called out on.
I encourage everyone do your own research when it comes to wars in other countries. Toull definitely learn more than what are news wants us to know.
Everyone believes in their own religion or personal preferences. Everyone should have the right to. Everyone should not feel judged in the country that they live in.
It's irrespective of the reasons. Governments are rarely to ever become transparent.
Likely, the bombing at Basims house was reported. The bombing was only documented with no action past that.
You can imagine the destruction. The USA dropped the MOAB bomb on a town. The intent was to kill a handful of ISIS fighters.
This is something that I personally struggle with.
As a Christian, I strive for that kind of quality. Again this illustrates how those people who practice Islam and Christianity can find plenty of common ground. Islam and Christianity values are similar.
This is why Sam says that traveling the world is an important experience. It puts a face to all of those faceless people in the world. It forces us to confront them as real people. It recognize their issues as legitimate.
You can tell this man is extremely wise. How intelligent he was to not hold onto the anger.
Their adversity inspires me. Their courage inspires me. They hold no resentment towards us American citizens. They know how it feels to be in a situation where their country is acting in ways that they might not have approved of.
It is a lot easier to point the finger to somebody other than yourself.
There's only one way to fix this. It's to teach the value of empathy. It's just like Dr. Richards is teaching it to us.
I also really enjoyed hearing Basim speak in class. It made me realize a whole other perspective. To look at the issues that we face in the middle east.
I believe that interference in other countries by the United States. Is not only necessary. Can be very helpful as a whole.
If we start telling other cultures how to live than essentially we are no better than ISIS.
But as you said before I thought it was really horrific how Basim described and showed his city.
I take life in the United States for granted sometimes.
He has not spoken about Latinos at all. He hasn't done in since classes started. It was bit concerning to me.
I felt a bit left out of the conversation. I am a Latino man.
He said that he spent time last semester talking about Latinos. His class changes every year.
I felt better. That conversation, on my people, would come around sooner than later.
There was another topic he discussed. It was people's inclination that Middle Eastern people are all bad.
I think that is a perfect conversation to have. It is a hot topic right now.
I am surprised to see this. Why didn't he do that?
I could not understand how he could be calm.
I think. The way you expressed his actual feelings is very true.
When you expressed that his religion tells him to act in that manner. It showcases how peaceful of a religion Islam is. Contrary to popular belief. Here in the United States.
Ravi was able to clear any misconceptions that the media could have taught us. Ravi showed that we are all very similar.
I chose this one. I believe a lot of people tend to forget. War doesnt only affect soldiers. It also affects innocent civilians in that country.
In the video Sam was talking about what is happening in the U.S.
People fail to realize. this is a real place with real people. Sam stated.
He introduces his friend Rafi. They met through NATO who came up with the plan. The plan was to start dialogues between soldiers with military cadets in conflict zones.
It is sad because his job consists of trying to keep the peace in that country.
He also wants to make Afghanistan a better place for his daughters. They grow up.
I am really glad you are enjoying the class. I find myself enjoying it for similar reasons.
The strength Bassim has in continuing to forgive is remarkable.
I dont think its fair in any way.
The point that you make about asking average Americans whether or not they feel safer knowing that our government has bombed the house of such a kind-hearted, normal man like Bassim is a very good one.
However, after talking with Bassim, its like getting slapped in the face with the knowledge. Weve just been turning a blind eye to the tragedies that have befallen innocent men, women, and children as a result of the irresponsible and reckless actions of our government and our military. It's too sad for us to think about.
Hello, Monique. I thought this video was pretty upsetting, too.
If something like this happened to my family. I don't think I could ever forgive the people. Who were the ones to blame.
You hear stories like this. It really makes you wonder. Why this war is even going on over there?
After seeing this video, it makes me wonder. How many more stories like this exist? We don't hear of.
I really think you brought up some good points.
This was one of the videos I considered writing my response to as well.
After watching this video, I wondered too why more Americans weren't mad about all the outcomes that war has.
I think that he was very strong to be able to move on from something like that.
I experienced death in my family as well. First hand I know that it is extremely difficult to overcome something like that.
I think that we are extremely grateful to be present in a relatively safe and stable country. We try to be empathetic towards others who aren't so lucky.
One of the things that Sam points out is that he is trying to get us to put ourselves in other peoples shoes.
People may think that they are actively putting themselves in other peoples shoes in order to understand the undertakings that they deal with every day. heyre not fully immersed in that persons culture.
In order to fully comprehend what another person is feeling empathy is needed. Empathy in itself is a difficult thing to achieve.
We just had a better understanding of other peoples lives. Maybe there would not be so many conflicts between countries.
I am constantly trying to empathize with other people. I do it on a daily basis. I'd rather have empathy for someone. I'd rather not hate them.
I would want someone to have the same courtesy towards me. the roles were switched.
Maybe even world peace would not just be a goal. World peace would be an actual reality.
Everything is going on with the Middle East. We don't think about the people's lives there.
They are also human beings. Not everyone who lives in Middle East are terrorists.
Hearing Basim's story, I feel much more connected to the war and its implications.
Things are getting better. it won't get back to normal any time soon.
His response stuck with me. I strongly agree.
He explained. Everything happens for a reason.
G-d gave him another chance at life. Why would he suffer? Be sad during his life.
Of course he misses them. There is nothing he can do about it.
I agree. Everything happens for a reason.
He said in the end of this video chat . A good old girl friend came back into his life.
He is happy. That's all that matters.
Just remember, everything happens for a reason.
That sounds kind of depressing in some ways. I feel this way. I dont think there is any way I can change what is happening in society today.
It challenged my thinking. It made me look at things a different way. It was different than I would have normally.
Sam, then, talked about how the same reason the United States military went into Iraq was for oil.
The war we are starting is effecting the lives of innocent Iraq citizens.
After Sam gave a talk and it got a lot of interest in the Middle East, on man named Bassim reached out to Sam to tell him that everything he said in the talk was correct.
The talked challenged people to try to put themselves in the shoes of someone living over in Iraq.
One day, Sam got a bunch of notifications on his phone. He found out that Bassims house had been bombed.
He said thats what his religion taught him. He said that's how he will live.
This was fine. In college I realized there was always so much going on in the media during day to day life  I really was not aware of situations happening around me
This was all towards stuff happening in the United States.
In this class alone so far I have been caught up to date with so much going on.
I think about if people were more knowing about what was happening about the world around. They would be more concerned They would be more willing to help.
Achievement obtained fighting for what our founding fathers believed in.
It' has been to indisputable. What is written in this clause. A stop must be put to the Religious Freedom Bills that are being approved.
He wanted everyone to be aware of everyone around you. That there is life outside the U.S.
He said that there are regular people out there They want the same things that we do
I am upset to say that I was not aware of this before this class. To learn is why I am to college. This class has given me that opportunity.
To improve the learning of other countries Bassim said to do our own personal research.
Just like Bassim said, if we make it a goal of ours to be involved in other countries, I believe that we would be more accepting of diversity.
To be more accepting of diversity this can break down stereotypes. Stereo types that people have of groups different from their own.
It is pretty hard for the United States to effectively learn about other cultures. Our media effects most of what news they want the viewers to be exposed to.
Reading your response, I agree with you. Bassims advice to the class is really important.
I also believed. Being in this sociology class has kept me updated with stuff. Other countries are going through.
I also agree. Many misunderstanding and tragedies would be lessened. People should be more aware of other cultures, customs, and values.
This all can be done with global awareness. this is not happening enough.
Just like you, I think it is important to encourage college students to keep up with world news. college students are the new generations that will be making a difference.
The way Sam was talking about bombed houses completely opened my eyes. It reminded me that Iraq is not just a battlefied. It is a country with innocent people. They are just trying to live their lives peacefully.
This is one of the reasons. It's why revolution in Ukraine happened.
it is pretty clear that this war is not for the land. this war is to destabilize already weakened by corruption Ukrainian economy. later on this land would be easy to take.
I can relate to being guilty of not doing enough of my own personal research.
I do believe that if more people managed to find the time to educate what was going on around us. If they looked past what only the media was portraying to us then we could realize we are similar to many around us.
I want to say that it's not just our fault. This is what we learned from news. Mews that only reports about terrorism.
What we can do to reduce prejudice on an individual level is to learn about other cultures actively.
Imagine you use your map of reality to look at other people's map of reality you will distort their map
I think what Dr. Smith said correlates what Sam motivates us to do. Put aside our beliefs. That we can treat other cultures fairly.
I think it is a very good point. Being angry at others does nothing but harm yourself.
It is crucial to understand who caused the problem you are in. it is similar to how Mr. Razzo did. he could differentiate that the problem was not from the general Americans. he could differentiate that the problem was from the government.
There is a high possibility that they see us just as we see them. Both religions have different perspectives.
This is similar to another saying. Treat others the way you want to be treated.
Nothing that is happening in the world around us is a constant thing. Every day begins a new journey and the world will never stop changing.
I also grew up Christian. As of recently, I have decided. I want to be a Buddhist. There is nothing stopping me from being able to practice Buddhism. which I think is a really awesome thing.
He touches on views of all different religions. He focused on the phobia of the Islam culture and religion.
I think this is really eye-opening. Growing up in American culture teaches us ethnocentric beliefs.
I put myself into the shoes of someone who follows a religion other than my own I gain perspective. ot many Americans have these days.
Empathy is such a hard thing for people. Especially for those who are sheltered.
We learn perception. Empathy becomes so much easier to obtain
I consider myself to be biased. I am a special needs person. I only have the United States point of view. I have lived in this country all my life.
I agree with that because of what I am doing.
Here's who's the best to teach about something like he did. It is a person who has lived that event.
To me the war is just be more educated. It's to be understanding of what is going on in the world.
The world is scary. Wake up. you live here. You need to know what is going on.
All I can say about Basim is that he is an amazing man. Basim deserves so much in this world.
If something like this were to happen to me, I would still be angry. how could someone take everything I loved away from me in the blink of an eye. I wasnt even part of the war that is going on around me. Loosing everything then be given very little money.
Basim is such inspiration. Shows that no matter what life throws at you. You can have another outlook on life.
Basim is forgiving. Basim said he wants justice for what happened to his family.
He said it was basically a nightmare. It was very difficult to get back into the city.
I found it interesting to hear Basim say that he is Muslim. He does not want to be ruled by Muslim leaders.
Basim did not blame Americans. Basim blamed the American government.
Instead of hating anyone from the country of the United States of America, he really dug deep. he thought about who caused this nightmare.
Growing up, we learn about the high points in Americas history. everything we have done in order to become the country that we are.
Bassim lived in Mosul, Iraq. It was unrecognizable from the Mosul of today.
His house looked beautiful. His house was surrounded by entire neighborhoods of beautiful homes.
But still, he found a way to get past his anger.
If this had happened to me, I don't think I ever would have been able to forgive.
Bassim said he was angry for a while. He realized his anger hurt him more than it benefit him.
This also speaks to how details can get lost in the big picture.
Someone unfamiliar with people living in the United States was shown what our government did to Bassim's home in Mosul. I would not be surprised. They made a quick judgement. The United States is violent. and everyone in it is violent.
We would all like to think that we make a little bit of a difference when we cast our vote every four years. Every four years some people are thrilled. Some are bitterly disappointed by the result of the presidential election. It often seems like the world is saved. the world is ending.
Basim drew attention. little actually changes with the changes in leadership.
President Trump was elected. was bitterly disappointed.
Very little has actually happened.
This gives me hope for Americas future. It draws attention to the stagnation that bureaucracy creates. If we are safe from negative change, we are stuck. We are stuck when it comes to positive change.
Basim truly drew attention to this. He said that each administration makes promises. They promise they will end the corruption in the Iraqi government. Nothing has happened.
This fact - that the foreign policy under an Islamophobic president will remain largely the same as it was under a president like Obama . This is terrifying.
We may feel better. Someone new comes into power. We all need to educate ourselves on what the actual policies are. How these policies affect people worldwide.
I chose this clip. I too was curious about this question. I was intrigued by the response.
First off, I thought it was an incredible experience to hear Basim talk.
It was great to get a perspective from someone on the other side.
I was interested to hear how he had dealt with all the hardships that have occurred in his life.
The response he gave to the question "How are you not angry with America, was shocking at first. But it made complete sense.
I think some people believe that everyone following this same religion is harmful. generalizations should not be made.
Another thing that stood out to me. he said that the problem is with the government not the American people.
I think Basim is very strong. Overcoming this anger. Being able to forgive. Everything he has been through.
This is when one would realize. It is not worth it to be angry anymore. The only person that is being hurt by it is yourself.
I thought this was a great clip. I agree that Basim is an amazing man.
He and the other people had their houses destroyed. They deserve so much more. What the American government offered them is not enough.
I would be angry for a longer period of time. I think I would realize the same thing that Basim did.
He realized. It was not worth being angry anymore. It was only harming him.
You mention. People would turn away from their religion. I did not think about this until now. This could be very true.
Basim turns to his religion to lead him to forgiveness. l a religion can be powerful to someone.
I think forgiving helps him cope. He can try to be happy again.
Sam discusses how he starts classes differently depending on what he is excited about. I think that it is a really miraculous aspect of the class. Considering the way a school normally works.
, teachers teach based off a pretty straight forward schedule. moving into more detailed lessons.
One of the things that this class has provided me with thIs far, is the ability to take a step back from my biases. see things from a different perspective.
More recently, I was able to step into someone else's shoes. We talked about how Christians are never talked down on as compared to Muslims. Christians have committed heinous acts against people.
We live in a Christian-based society. People are so quick to call a Muslim violent. The same arguments they use against Muslims can be thrown right back at Christians.
His question was this. You think about the United States political leaders since they came into the Iraq war. Is there a difference between them for you and the Iraqi people?
I knew our troops were over there trying to keep the civilians safe. I assumed our leaders were trying hard too.
Basim stated that politicians are pocketing the benefits that should be going elsewhere.
I know we have problems within our own country that we also need to focus on. But I feel empathy for the people in Afghanistan.
Saying that nothing has changed since 2003 is crazy to hear.
My initial reaction was that the reason I was far off everytime Sam asked us to guess a statistic. Like of the 963 people killed by police officers in 2016 in the United States, how many of them were black?
I have a theory. The media tends to shy away. Showing statistics like these.
I was the reason. I overestimated these statistics. I underestimated these statistics.
It is much easier for people to listen to the news. They have already done all the research for us. So it seems.
If we truly want to get the full picture, we have to do research on our own time. We have to seek out data that could contradict our beliefs.
Caring enough to take the time out of your day to research statistics isn't easy The statistics could potentially invalidate what you believe
I find myself feeling ashamed of wanting to go into the media right now for two reasons.
We can do our own research. But there's a possibility the statistics or evidence may prove us wrong.
We could make this the new normal. Then the media would be more inclined to present more statistics. Therefore we would get more facets of the story.
Sam brought a good topic about what his main objective is. The main takeaway from his class.
Those people who are Christians and kill people are for somewhat not considered to be Christians. for the Muslims that idea does not actually work.
I, personally, have no response to this. I am very intrigued. I have not thought of that before.
One of the key concept you mentioned on your reply was the idea of media influencing our thoughts. They influence our perception going around the world.
We see repeatedly news on police brutality. We see the idea that Black people are being killed by police. We see that it is unlawful.
I want to say you have clearly explained what a misinterpretation we had on police brutality of the Black race. We do not see the media showing these statistics. You said it undermines the movement. You said usually media covers what people are interested in. and if people are the reason we have these misinterpretations of police brutality then we have no one else but ourselves to blame.
Sam brought up Saddam Hussein. I immediately made a connection. My grandfather actually worked for Saddam Hussein at a particular point.
I was not aware that we went into Iraq because of Oil.
The slideshow of Bassam with his wife. The slideshow just showed that they were normal individuals.
These people are not always at war. That's what we need to come to terms with.
People envision Iraq. This place of war. In actuality, there are places like malls. Just how the malls in New Jersey look.
Never would I thought we would be able to Skype Bassam. When he popped up, I just wanted to give him a big hug.
Its so abnormal (for Americans in America) to think of how our lives would be affected in a war.
I wondered how his everyday life had been affected by all the conflict.
A man his age has lived through some extremely difficult times in Iraq.
There are already some things that have changed around Mosul.
I knew that there had been changes. I was not aware of the specific ones made.
a group of people came into America. people prohibited all citizens from doing certain things. I would not know how to react.
It was interesting to hear from someone who actually lives in Iraq. It was interesting to see their point of view on it.
During the class from minutes 38 to the end is the part I will be discussing.
I enjoyed discovering that when they are home they do not cover up.
They don't have to wear hijab around men they can't marry.
Another fact I am glad I learned.
I find it interesting. he would like to go back to his nightmare.
The separation of church and state and it should be separate in his opinion was very interesting. He is Muslim. Muslims live everyday based on their religion.
Those qualities to have when learning about this topic are very important.
I also had the question as to how other countries view our government.
Basim was sharing. I was questioning. "How is this reality?"
The women who wore the Hijab's were completely fine. They were wearing.
I would never change my clothing because of men. it was interesting to see how women are still under a man's control.
In their eyes they probably did not see modesty as oppression. To me, a western woman i saw it as men having the ultimate power.
Special needs is a topic that needs to be discussed. Be better understood.
That's a strength rather than a weakness. .People with special needs should not be seen as a human with problems. .People with special needs should rather praised for being able to see the world in a different light.
As long as people are educated and aware there really is no way to force a person to care about one thing over another.
Basim was talking about his experience. It shed some light for me.
It is hard to see that our country has caused so much hurt to innocents. I think more people should be made aware of it.
I think about what happened in Mosul. It should be far more common knowledge than it is.
I think Americans' demand may contribute. We do not always see this sort of coverage.
We do not want to see our country devastating the lives of innocents. It is not shown to us as frequently as it ought to be.
The first thing he pointed out. This is the same question someone asked last year in Sam's class.
I found this very interesting. How can so many of us be thinking the same thing? Yet we are completely wrong.
Why is it that we think Basim is so angry? Why is it that we think Basim is so full of hatred? He later establishes that he is not.
I question if I would be able to say the same had I been in his shoes.
He narrowed it down. Americans really played a role in what happened to him and his family.
I found this intriguing. The Bible would say to forgive. Not be full of hatred.
It is frustrating when you feel as though you have no control over the place where you live and call home.
Then tragedy struck. His house was bombed, killing his closest family members.
Everything has happened. Basim has been back to Mosul to visit.
The war on ISIS. Mosul was destroyed.
It is hard to even wrap my head around the amount of loss that these people are going through. The city is rebuilt how these people will be able to continue living their lives with what had happened to them.
Most people lost not only their houses but family members. Family members can never be replaced.
I think Basim is an extremely strong man. Reacting the way he did.
I like what you said. Details getting lost in the big picture.
He did not judge all of us It proves how great of a man he truly is.
We all have some idea of what it is like to live in Afghanistan. An idea of what the people are like there.
Our education system lacks in teaching us about history and geography around the world. It will never teach us everything we should know.
I just thought that is was because of religious purposes.
I also found it interesting to find out that behind closed doors they actually wear similar things to what people here in the United States wear.
Here's what one student said. They actually wear normal bathing suits. That's when they are just hanging around with other women.
The newer part is getting better. All five bridges were bombed. It's hard to get across the river.
He finds it difficult to go back to Mosul. He expects to be back in the next four months.
I personally would never be able to go back to that if I was in his situation.
I thought it was very cool when he said that a lot of his friends were of the Christian religion.
I were Bassim. My entire family was killed in a random bombing. I would be extremely upset. I would be angry. would definitely struggle to forgive and get over this anger.
It was during lecture. I was wondering the same question that the girl asked. How could Bassim not be angry with we Americans? We essentially caused him to lose everything he had in his life. over a randomized incident?
I feel as though his response was somewhat inspiring.
What really inspired me though was his ability to get over it.
I cannot understand. He was able to use religion. He overcame this obstacle.
I think this hit hard for me. we saw photographs of Bassim in America.
He said he lived here for eight or so years. He was always being respected by other American citizens.
I found the entire lecture inspiring. The lecture gave me something to really think about.
I did not come from a very religious family. The bible was taught to me a different way. It was taught from a young age. The bible is just readings. not my way of life.
The idea of using the Bible to resolve controversial topics like discrimination and abortion is not rational. these issues are very prominent in our modern day society. the bible was written thousands of years ago.
However, it does not provide every rule for the varying situations that these crimes present. That is where it becomes hard to interpret what the bible is actually trying to say.
Same asked us to discuss the numbers It was for police brutality of black people. My number was way off.
Is it really helping us?
We need to take action today. If we dont, tomorrow will be an even bigger sight of confusion, violence, and discomfort.
No one ever stops to think. Try to imagine things from the other persons perspective.
Say it is the same thing. Judging a black person from a white persons perspective.
I believe this is one of the biggest problems with the world. Many conflicts end up arising.
The best example of this mentioned in the video was when Sam was talking about Muslim terrorists.
When he was talking about the things that ISIS made the people of Mosul do, it made me think about the muslim men in my community at home.
Im not sure. he same meaning is taught in ISIS groups.
I think that when something big effects a people as a whole, especially in a negative way it is hard for one to hope that the future will go back to normal or be better.
I thought you made a great analogy. you closed your response. treat others as you want to be treated.
People love to be quick to judge. They never take the time. They never truly try to understand it from another persons perspective.
it is easy to judge that Muslims are terrorists. This is after you see a small group of them do something terrible.
What you do not often? the majority of Muslims condemn this the same way we do.
I believe no one has the right to judge. Unless you jump into another person's shoes. Unless you think of the situation from their perspective.
Bassim explained that we need to take advantage of the new forms of communication. we have to relate to people across the world.
We as a nation are very self centered when it comes to our global views and beliefs.
We do not attempt to reach out to people who live in different countries enough. we have all of the proper technology to do so.
Here's why I feel that we do this. We are uncomfortable. It's hard trying to connect with people from different cultures.
I find this to be very sad. There is clearly so much to learn from the world around us.
We were able to Skype Bassim from across the map. We know it is possible.
We have many different outlets to the world. They are at our fingertips. I feel very motivated to utilize them.
Another point that Bassim made was how much our media influences us as a country.
Everyone is constantly worrying about their social status in the media. Than focusing on genuine human connection.
When this question was asked the first thing that ran through my mind was obviously it posed a negative threat on them.
That is correct. I did not even consider the depth that Basim's answer would be.
I was ignorant to the fact that ISIS is terrorizing not only the land, but its people too.

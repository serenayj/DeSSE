All we learn about in the US is that this is a place of opportunity, future, freedom, and hope.
To know that other people in other countries dont even have sight of anymore hope really makes you put into thought the rights you take for granted.
When you say you just believed that Iraq was a place of fighting and thought nothing more of it, this is exactly what I once thought too.
We were both ignorant in a way towards the harsh realities of what happens outside the US.
In addition, we only know about the things that are either told to us or taught to us.
This is exactly what this class allows us to do and for that I am grateful.
He still likes Americans because his friends have treated him well and made him see we can be good people.
The only problem he states is the government.
If I lost my family to a bomb sent by another country, I do not know what I would do.
It is horrible to think that families everyday are being killed for no reason just because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I guess I can see how Basim does not hate America because it was not just all of America.
I think that more people, including me, need to take on the same attitude that he portrays, especially with everything he has been through.
This also is a lesson to America that when we make a plan to attack another country, we are ruining innocent lives.
I personally thought that many women were just forced to wear hijabs and they could not do anything about it.
I did know that they were allowed to take it off in their home, but I never realized that they only had to wear them around other men.
It was also interesting to hear a group of females wearing hijabs answering questions from girls without hijabs because I do not know about everyone else, but personally I have not seen these two groups talk to each other in person.
I am not saying that these women hate each other, but it is something I personally just have not seen growing up in a very white town.
It is always cool seeing different cultures interact with each other because people will always find similarities between them.
I wrote about this specific portion of class last week, and I too think Basim shows a great deal of character in this video.
It would be almost too easy to do so, the real challenge is forgiving.
It is super brave and inspirational to see Basim react the way he has.
I was truly inspired by this talk with Basim and find myself trying to emulate his way of forgiveness even on a much smaller scale in my daily life.
I think that this is a very important lesson that many people dont realize, you cannot live your life being angry at the world and others around you, but rather be thankful for what and who you have.
Basim went through an experience that nobody should ever have to, but hes living his life to the fullest possible which is so important.
Being angry will not bring his loved ones back, so he has to live every day to make them proud.
If you havent smiled today, then smile.
I think that you raise some very valuable points.
His speech did make me feel extremely grateful and realize that life is amazing and we have to be thankful for the people we have in it.
It's difficult to stay informed when our media is trying to keep us sheltered from the events happening around the globe.
You skip specific examples and get the full picture without being influenced.
I knew of women that were Muslim by wearing the Hijab.
At least in this country we have have to right to think about what we want as long as it does not harm anybody or yourself.
We also have the right to dress the way we want to.
I agree most people are biased on this subject because of only and lived in the United States.
We do not really understand something until we have someone like Dr. Richards speak what people do not know out loud.
I completely agree, and I think this comes back to what Sam was saying about Christian Sharia.
Imagine if we were expected to abide by all laws laid out in the Bible word-for-word.
Yet, some people would like this to be instated.
What should be even scarier for us as Americans is that we aren't so far from that reality ourselves.
We need to protect our religious freedom so we don't see Christian extremists come into power here.
Sarah, I very much agree with all you had to say.
We never can really understand life over there unless we experience it ourselves, but talking to Afghanis does make a difference.
Even though people may not find it comfortable, issues like what we discuss in class are not ironclad.

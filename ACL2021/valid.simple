We are taught that the US is a place of opportunity, future, freedom, hope.
To know that other people in other countries dont even have sight of anymore. hope really makes you put into thought the rights.
When you say you just believed that Iraq was a place of fighting. I thought nothing more of it. This is exactly what I once thought too.
We were both ignorant in a way. We were ignorant toward the harsh realities of what happens outside the US.
We only know about the things that are told to us. That are taught to us.
This is exactly what this class allows us to do. I am grateful for that.
He likes Americans. his friends have treated him well. his friends made him see we can be good people.
The only problem he states is the government.
Had I lost my family to a bomb sent by another country, I do not know what I would do.
It is horrible to think. Families everyday are being killed for no reason. They are in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I guess I can see how Basim does not hate America. I was not just all of America.
I think that more people, including me, need to take on the same attitude that he portrays. we need to take on the same attitude with everything he has been through.
This also is a lesson to America. When we make a plan to attack another country, we are ruining innocent lives.
I personally thought. Many women were just forced to wear hijabs. They could not do anything about it.
I did know. They were allowed to take it off in their home. I never realized. They only had to wear them around other men.
Interesting to hear a group of females wearing hijabs answering questions from girls without hijabs. I do not know about everyone else. I have not seen these two groups talk to each other in person.
I am not saying that these women hate each other. It is something I personally just have not seen growing up in a very white town.
It is always cool seeing different cultures interact with each other. People will always find similarities between them.
I wrote about this specific portion of class last week. I, too, think Basim shows a great deal of character in this video.
It would be almost too easy to do so. The real challenge is forgiving.
It is super brave. Inspirational to see Basim react the way he has.
I was truly inspired by this talk with Basim. I find myself trying to emulate his way of forgiveness even on a much smaller scale in my daily life.
I think that this is a very important lesson that many people don't realize. You cannot live your life being angry at the world and others around you. Be thankful for what and who you have.
Basim went through an experience that nobody should ever have to. He's living his life to the fullest possible. Living life to the fullest is so important.
Being angry will not bring his loved ones back. He has to live every day to make them proud.
If you havent smiled today, then smile.
I think that you raise some very valuable points.
His speech did make me feel extremely grateful. I realize that life is amazing. We have to be thankful for the people we have in it.
It's difficult to stay informed. Our media is trying to keep us sheltered. They hide the events happening around the globe.
You skip specific examples. You get the full picture, too. You do so without being influenced.
I knew of women that were Muslim. wearing the Hijab.
At least in this country we have have to right to think about what we want. This is as long as it does not harm anybody or yourself.
We have the right to dress the way we want to.
I agree. Most people are biased on this subject. It's because they only lived in the United States.
We do not really understand something. We have someone like Dr. Richards speak. What people do not know.
I completely agree. I think this comes back to what Sam was saying about Christian Sharia.
Imagine if we were expected to abide by all laws laid out in the Bible word-for-word.
Some people would like this to be instated.
It should be even scarier for us as Americans. We aren't so far from that reality ourselves.
We need to protect our religious freedom. We don't see Christian extremists come into power here.
Sarah, I very much agree with all you had to say.
We never can really understand life over there. Until we experience it ourselves. talking to Afghanis does make a difference.
People may not find it comfortable. Issues, like the ones we discuss in class, are not ironclad.

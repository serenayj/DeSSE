Sam is more of a preacher than he seems to be a teacher and I honestly don't think i'll miss a single class all year because of it.
In that kind of environment, people are not racist, but rather embarrassingly entitled, and feel like they aren't allowed to acknowledge someone's ethnicity in fear of sounding racist or offensive in any way.
It is impossible to tell the tone of the person who is posting, so it is unclear whether they are being hurtful or playful.
It is only natural because they are human beings.
In college, students are immersed in a diverse environment, so it is necessary to keep an open mind when trying to judge a persons background based on how they look.
Your histories are different, but it makes me curious that once you moved to the states, what exactly changed?
However, I do understand why people perceive a tiny bit of racism in sports.
It allows us to form a more nuanced understanding and to finally realize that these numbers we hear are referring to real people.
I, being an international student from Venezuela, do not understand football at all because it is not a common sport back at home.
It is evident that society's influences on the accessible power of certain races is primarily responsible for this mode of thinking, though.
The city is split into four quarters: the Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and Armenian quarters.
At this point in social media, I feel that anyone who puts themselves out there will end up being discussed online because it is a relative news story and people want to voice their opinion.
Until America can ignore the fact that people have different skin colors totally, meaning there will be no discrimination or prejudice to different races, we can not stop talking about race.
There is a girl in my lab who is from Afghanistan, who currently has friends and family living there.
I know I will look at this idea in a deeper way since first discussing it and appreciate your points.
I would also add that another thing that plays a big part in this issue is the fact certain sports are played in certain areas due to weather conditions.
Eniola, I think it is very interesting how you said that before coming to the United States you did not consider yourself to be black.
I really liked how you tied in your own background being African.
I distinctly remember this conversation happening in class because of the way resonated with it.
Similarly, the guest speaker was a lawyer, a highly respected job, with kids and a wife, just like an average guy growing up in the United States.
However, I still had a very hard time identifying who belonged to what category.
The extremists involved with the Taliban or other similar groups are on the fringe and do not accurately represent the views of the average Afghan citizens that just try to get by peacefully each day.
This also goes with saying the environment of people as well.
There has been many events and conflicts now and in the past that clearly shows the huge impact racism has had on everyone.
People tend to believe that in Afghanistan, there are just horrible people who are fighting a war.
I am from a town where a majority of the population is white.
I think 9/11 was the closest thing any of us have experienced in our lifetime.
America is a very diverse country and is moving towards having more and more diversity each day.
I mentioned how I was one of the many people that thought immediately of war when Afghanistan was brought up in class, which I now agree is definitely not true.
I was confused by this statement because if he is an atheist and thus does not believe in any kind of God or superior being, then what is he praying to?
It also shows what Penn State stands for and that we do not agree with such ideas.
Many people like to say this when they are explaining equality, but many also just look at it as empty words, only said to be seen as socially acceptable.
Many people that have a strong opinion regarding race are not willing to accept that they could be wrong.
This is why hearing individuals' stories -- like Rafi's -- is paramount.
Personally, at first glance, I would have grouped the two girls together, so I thought it was interesting to look at it from a different perspective.
I find it interesting that you thought this feeling of discomfort came from a lack of education on racial issues.
I think this false perception of what a war zone is like comes from lack of knowledge about the Middle East.
I agree that if I was up there I definitely would have done a terrible job of putting people into groups.
It is fascinating to learn how different races celebrate the holidays.
As a Latina I understand what being a minority in the United States is like.
And I too also believe it will eventually lead to less discrimination.
We all consciously are the same, but we put people into different categories and associate them with certain things.
What I mean by that is, just by looking at those students, most people would not be able to know what their backgrounds are.
That being said, it can still be used for good.
In this video a student named Jeffton was asked to go down a line of 13 other students and group them by where their ancestors may have been from.
Personally I think it is a solid mix of both and this should not be the case.
People get dumb tattoos that don't mean anything and they aren't alienated for centuries.
What happened in the United States that made it different than the rest?
You do not have any evidence to back up that other countries cultures are richer and just because their children are smarter does not mean they are happier or better off than us.
I think that it is not fair to say that you know for a fact that something is better than another if you have not experienced both firsthand.
It turned out she was actually from Mexico (I was pretty shocked back then).
But the fact of the matter is that sometimes Sam really forgets that money exists.
It is imperative to understand a persons culture before making any assumptions about what kind of person they may be.
Yes, I know not all of them are good citizens, but we do need to understand that a lot of them are working hard every day tomake postive changes for their country.
Just by simply having a conversation with my friends the other day we had a light-hearted argument over the correct pronunciation of the word crayon.
The problem with this information tube is that it claims to be the knowledge of the world.
When Sam explained that the student would have to categorize all the students into groups depending on their ethnicity, I felt like if I was the one participating that I would do well.
As for myself, I would have no problem dating outside of my race even though I am from a very small town with little diversity.
In a kinesiology class I took last semester, we talked about how the access to a sport like basketball is much easier than a sport like hockey.
However, upon conversing with them it is easy to see that they are indeed very different features from me.
I do want to stress that there is racial injustice all over the globe and that there are other places to live that offer minorities far less opportunity than the United States.
I have trouble understanding how creationism could be legitimate but I also strongly believe in evolution so that really verifies my way of thinking.
sadly Race mixing is considered a New concept by many people due to cultural assumptions and ignorance.
*by the way... dont believe is corny at all.
By not judging others by how they look based on stereotypes we could learn that most people around the world are the same.
Those dividends being the presence of people belonging to hundreds of religions, speaking thousands of languages and belonging to countless different communities peacefully co existing with one another as Indians as opposed to as various religious groups or separate communities.
This may help realize that most people have more similarities than they do differences.
It's impossible to move on from something if there was no closure given and if the issue is still prevalent.
There, over the course of four years I had lost my slight southern twang and taken up a more neutral accent.
Not only can we never repair the damage that has been done, but we have made so little effort to do so.
Remarkably, Professor Richards pointed out in class that in my country the servers or maids usually have darker skin, which led me to evaluate the undertone racial issues occurring back at home.
It has always been a goal of mine to get the best grades I can achieve and sometimes Im barely even learning!
Other countries have had racial atrocities and protest for equality.
I also had this mentality when it came to Afghanistan or other countries located in the Middle East.
I think it has to do with more than race.
Sam touched briefly on the topic of America as a melting pot.
I am referring to the injustices that are so obvious that we are embarrassed to talk about them.
I was actually surprised to see that they were Spanish.
The concept is the same as hanging out with your friend all the time causes you to pick up and start using things that they say or do.
What happens if they are wrong?
Some of the people had thick accents that I would have never guessed had and this could give away their nationality.
Its again that difference between talking in the physical class vs. talking on Twitter.
For example, there are some ESPN NFL analysts who played the game before that wonder why black players are always on the wrong side of things and question why white people are never put into question.
People really don't realize that any day can be their last day and always have the mindset of 'tomorrow can wait', whereas Rafi has to live every day with a chip on his shoulders because like us, he isn't guaranteed anything.
Then as time goes on, different groups evolved and traveled to different locations resulting in a variety of different distinct features.
I mentioned this in my response, but when I studied abroad in the Netherlands, I found out that the European countries have race problems as well.
What kind of body do you need for basketball?
I agree with this completely as I believe sports are dominated by cultural upbringings.
Growing up Race was never talked about because I grew up in a majority white town.
War is always in action, even if were not hearing about it.
To me race is not a big deal because of the kind of high school I went to.
It was also easier for me to look at the photos of the Native Americans and Chinese to determine which was which.
There are many others just like Rafi and his family who are trying to have a better future and a normal life.
I immediately realized I had been spending a lot of time around my friends from Arkansas and picked up on the expression.
Ive met so many people who does not talk about race enough to be aware of the actual issue.
I've been realizing more and more that they do have Asian face features.
Coming to Penn State, I gained a whole new perspective on different cultures, whether it was meeting someone from another state or even a different country.
I really enjoyed that you brought up your personal relationship and I really liked how you said that you got along because you found each other interesting and attractive.
I have noticed that difference in both men and women that are hispanic and white.
If hockey is played in cold environments and most people of black descent live near the equator, it makes logical sense that there are very few significant black hockey players.
I have a inside look at things because not many people think about race until later in life.
One thing that I didn't mention in my original post was that there were 2 Czech women that came with us to teach us about their country.
Social media platforms provide information at our fingertips and I personally believe it's harder for our generation to be blind to the negative realities of the world.
They know what they know, and are blind to everything else.
This is due to a number of reasons and not one in particular one but I believe a main reason is because of how dependent people are on the media.
Our world is filled with diversity, especially here in America.
In order to move forward, we must shift to a more positive message of equality, rather than dwelling on the differences between races.
In my family, two of my cousins are black, one is Asian, and one has down syndrome so I have witnessed how people are treated differently weather is is spoken or just in people's actions.
We may think that other countries do this or that but in reality most of the people no matter where you go are the same.
These reasons are mediocre, and shouldnt be a deal breaker in any relationship, and its superficial.
Hate amongst ethnicities is deep rooted in the development of our country, which probably led to the problems the United States have today.
It is argued that in America the civil rights movement forced the discussion upon the people.
We are a very self centered country all together.
Where is the line between funny and mean?
The main issue is the ignorance people are so blind to notice they carry.
Bassims life was destroyed by accident.
But overall I really enjoyed this lecture and the way it opened my mind to so many new ways of thinking.
In essence, they are putting their lives on the line for the citizens of their country even though it is a place that has been engulfed in hate and war for years.
As a kid, this confused me, and I don't want our country's future generations feeling like race is an awkward topic of discussion.
I mean initially when I did think of Afghanistan I would say that my idea of the country was a lot of dust, war, and bombings.
I agree with what you said here about the rarity of white guys having an interest in black women.
We NEED to continue speaking about race, violence, war and other entities that are happening right now all over the world.
The biggest thing I personally took away from Rafi talking was that most of the people that are living in Afghanistan are peaceful and friendly.
This is what has pushed race to the forefront of conversation and makes our country progressive compared to others.
The United States has an obvious issue of not recognizing that its history is frequently unjust.
This is a pressing issue thats keeping the world even more divided.
I found that very strange since I am clearly not physically white.
Since they moved down south their skin color changed a little bit, but I totally understand now why Native Americans have face features that can get us confused sometimes.
CNN MSNBC FOX are so arrogant and confident in the way they provide news for people.
I believe that these ethnicity check boxes have no benefits whats so ever and I really hope that in the future it wont be a thing.
Russia is located on the continent Eurasia which means half of it is in Europe and Eastern half is in Asia.
Her lack of experiences with people of other races definitely impacted the way she viewed other people of different races.
While the student was trying to categorize them I was trying to work it out in my head too.
Seeing the struggles of Afghani people really opens my eyes and makes me appreciate my life.
The number of mixed race people is increasing exponentially as time passes.
This is very interesting to see, because I struggled within this religion aspect against the scientific proof.
Maybe just features that they personally just do not find to be as attractive when compared to other races, everyone obviously has a type.
I have also heard a lot of girls say I'm not into Black/Asianguys, on multiple occasions.
I think you make a great point when you state that majority of the population is intimidated to speak up about race because they fear that someone else will take their opinions the wrong way and twist it to something they did not intend.
Whether it is skin tones or shape of nose or eyes, we all appear differently.
While it would be ideal for all of us to be able to travel to Afghanistan and speak with families there, we cannot realistically do that.
Why would a kid living in Minnesota want to play baseball in below freezing temperatures?
We understand what war is and we know it can be devastating, but we do not always grasp the full effect.
It is interesting to learn just how little I really know about the world, and this class does that every day.
I also believe war can happen anywhere and that wouldnt change the way Americans are, so why do we judge Afghans and their country by this war?
The video that I watched and decided to comment on is Pay Attention to Distinct Differences.
Racism isn't just an American phenomenon, it exists in other countries as well.
Hearing Rafis story makes me want to learn more about how wars affect Afghan people and other people who live in warzones.
This is stating that people believe because you come from a specific place you must play that sport.
Race is something we should never be expected to stop talking about.
The media also has a big impact on discussing race because of prior events like Trump's election, Charlottesville, and the Black Lives Matter movement.
I remember one time I had to fill a form and when I reached the ethnicity check boxes, I couldn't find a box for Middle Eastern, but right next to the White box it said in apprentices ( if you are middle eastern check the white box).
There was something that Sam said that I have never thought of but humans are one of the only species that kill our own kind.
Parenting is a factor, as well as living in their own community.
People generalize one race because of what they were taught to believe.
What really surprised me was the first picture.
I discussed the Latino community because that it was I have the most knowledge of, but I know colorism exists in many other cultures.
I think it is important that people realize how similar human beings of different backgrounds are, so that people can begin to realize that one race is not smarter, or more civilized, or more superior than another.
Sam stated that if you hang out with people from different areas you really start to notice these differences helping you to become more cultured, rather than just seeing black people as just black people or white people as just white people.
Races should not be a reason to reject a chance for a relationship.
I found it funny how Sam displayed the picture of all the cars in a big road stuck in a traffic jam just like we may have all been in before.
They started speaking Spanish assuming she would not understand but she shortly called them out for it.
I really like how you broke down your thoughts and I completely agree with your comments.
All of the video choices were intriguing but I have a particular interest in the creation of the world.
I really like what you said and how you discussed LCT Gareys response to the question.
I think it's important to do things like this to see how other people group people.
Rafi was a guest speaker and was the description of a peaceful man who lives in Afghanistan.
In my opinion, I can see the perspective of the police or guards telling him this, as he is somewhat high profile in the society regarding peace during this time with the Taliban in Afghanistan.
After this lecture I have really taken a step back and tried to put myself in Rafis shoes for a moment.
I think that people get racism from old values and traditional beliefs.
In class, Professor Richards highlighted that genetics play a role which is true.
I am in a relationship now with a boy who is from Brazil.
Similar to what you were saying about being from an area where there are many people of Hispanic culture.
When Sam first started lining people up at the front of the room, I would try to guess their nationality solely based off of skin pigmentation.
II first did it around my mom who looked at me sideways and made some joke about being southern.
Here you pointed out how your father has been a football fan since you were born which led you to become one yourself, as culturally, so are most Americans.
The most ruthlessly pragmatic species the world has ever seen.
They do not want a war and believe in peace.
I realized that if I ever wanted to change these things about me, I would look less like my parents.
I come from a small community in Pennsylvania and went to a private school.
He talked about the fact that there are real people in Afghanistan who are suffering from the war.
People are brought into the world as innocent as any other, and only learn hate, stupidity, and ignorance through the words and actions of others.
An interracial couple can be portrayed in a positive and negative way due to the norms and values we have in our society.
Most of the time people automatically assume she is white.
My sister dated an African American boy and my grandfather made a rude comment about it and did not like the fact that they were dating.
It really is a shame and is sad that this war is getting nowhere.
Logical thinking would lead you to believe that race shouldn't be such a huge issue in 2017.
I was never introduced to the idea that these children go to school, play sports, and have friends just like I did.
I agree with this because when Christopher Columbus came before settlement, the Europeans immediately thought they were better and more worthy than the Native Americans.
I was very fortunate enough to grow up in a diverse area so i was exposed to many cultures and humans.
There needs to be more of a discussion as into why you see certain groups of people who rarely date outside of their race.
Hopefully one day race will no longer be a topic of discussion because everyone will be truly equal.
After hearing all of their traumatic stories from over the years, I always concluded that all the Afghans in Afghanistan were bad people.
After class, I went through some retrospective on the different accents of the diverse people that I know in my life.
I agree with you on the fact that Racism is a huge problem in America.
I did not care about that either.
With this being said, when there are racial issues and tension is present, no good can come from silence.
Also towards the beginning of the video Jeffton asks Sam Can I ask them for their names before grouping the individuals where Sam responds no.
India is years behind on accepting the rights of women, LGBTQA, and the bottom 1 %, and even giving respect to interracial marriage.
Being able to track how genes moved over time is extremely fascinating and it tells us a lot about the history of people.
Our choice is to start the turning and begin to open the conversation to how skin color is simply a marking.
After reading your passage, I found it interesting hearing your interpretation of what racism is, and how similar it is from culture to culture.
It also depends on what time period people were brought up in.
I agree that this topic is very interesting.
Also, that judging a persons personality based on their appearance is unfair to them.
What I feel is the most dangerous, is using race as a basis to divide up criminal action.
Similarly, war is talked about every single day, but you never really hear the media talking about the civilian people that are getting injured.
I completely agree with the fact that culture plays a big role in sports and that sports aren't inherently racist.
This is much different than the picture Sam showed us of Afghanistan around the 1960s.
The same thing is true about the United States because it definitely has its fair share of bad guys, but the majority of American citizens are nice people who only mean to well.
To some of those who think we talk about it too much might be hearing about a certain topic of race that is constantly being repeated.
However, I think that if we are all fundamentally the same we should think in similar ways and realize that there is no point in judging people for things that do not matter like crooked teeth and black shoes with a brown belt.
I think President Barron made the right decision to deny the alt-right people to come to Penn State and speak the to students.
So i thank you for your response, well done.
Throughout all of history, from the beginning of mankind, there has always been tensions between the different groups of people.
Nevertheless, the whole continent was built upon European conquering and slavery.
I think the world would be much better off if everyone were multiracial.
Not because my dad taught me that they were, but rather that I made this association based on the only stories I had ever heard about them.
I agree with everything you said and find your point about the news very interesting.
To be honest, I really did not know much about Afghanistan until Sam thoroughly talked about it in class and Rafi was there to explain more about his home life and experiences.
I don't know too much about religion in the past, but I find it astonishing how many people died for religion, today even.
That is my opinionthat I got from this lecture.
Afghanistan is a country filled with millions of people, and most of them are not bad individuals.
Many individuals and groups across the United States are extremely racist and do not accept others that happen to look differently than themselves.
I am not completely educated on how to react to it either, and sadly this allows us to be divided within our own race because we feel different.
I could not imagine leaving my house and saying goodbye to my mom or my dad every time as if it were really goodbye forever, just in case I am in the wrong place at the wrong time, the way Rafi does with his wife and family.
So I always find it intriguing when Sam straight up breaks down that awkward barrier.
Sam has had the opportunity to explore many different cultures which has helped him understand and accept all the different people in the world.
Because I havent been exposed to a lot of different races I feel very limited in my knowledge past the common stereotypes.
I do agree with a lot of the sentiments in this post.
By seeing the massive amounts of similarities, we have with foreign countries, our false perceptions can then change and we can then see that these people are just like us.
Unfortunately I think people may start comparing themselves by facial structures in the future because it would be more difficult for people to separate each other by race.
Personally, I see peace as a top priority and fully respect Rafis position and dedication.
People in different areas of the world are coming together and having children which is on the rise because people are more opened minded about race than in the past.
It was tough to see the numbers increasing in recent years of Afghan citizens killed and the military personal of both the US and especially Afghanistan.
Sam began class with showing us pictures of Afghanistan.
I say in the right way because I feel as if there are still uneducated close-minded people out there in the world who believe in racist thoughts.
His nationally is also Hispanic and usually Hispanics are only better at baseball but he became a great basketball player.
As an Asian-American, I noticed that my family too talk about colorism back in their home country, Vietnam.
Families just like mine are being brought up in such terrible conditions and it breaks my heart.
My parents are both Christian and I went to Catholic school so that may have some influence.
It's easy to see the obvious differences but it's the smaller distinct features that really tell you where your ancestors came from.
I also think that people just have a desire to be part of a group.
Because race is sensitive for a lot of people asking questions about it can be sensitive so I like the way that Sam says its just the way we our and differences is important because that is the same way I feel.
Black people are judged constantly and so are other races.
Maybe a feeling that they just don't relate and click on certain things.
From what I learned in history classes in earlier years, all humans migrated from Africa, so of course this makes sense, but it is one thing to learn about something, and another to have the proof before your eyes.
You cannot make someone do a sport.
Being around them a lot, I have actually found myself picking up some of their accent or language.
This difference in culture and fanatism leads athletes to decide which sport to play which I believe is the major influence in their decision.
I am not in any way trying to insult anyone, but lighter skinned individuals do have a privilege and need to be aware.
I agree with what Sean is saying in this video response.
I think some people avoid talking about these things because it would require them to admit that those stereotypes do exist.
Although Racism has deep connection in the US culture and unfolds many complex issues, I do not agree to the fact that it is something that can not be solved.
When discussing this topic in class and watching the lecture again, I had this sense of maybe we are talking about this more than normal, however this is something that should be discussed quite often.
He talks about how the world has this white supremacist ideology that white people are all wealthy and well off when in reality they are the ones who tend to be below the poverty line.
Dating someone from other culture has more benefits from my opinion.
I also don't understand how one can look down upon another basedon color or heritage, it makes zero sense.
The human body and evolution are both such fascinating topics and seeing how humans have changed over time to be best adapted for the environment in order to thrive where they live.
I really enjoyed hearing from both LCT Garey and Rafi as I think it really gave the class a better perspective of Afghanistan and the people of Afghanistan.
After hearing Rafi speak, I actually had an entire different mindset.
It is the nature of these arguments that make race such an issue today.
When I was in high school I played lacrosse and it was a very expensive sport to play.
It starts of by the guy talking about similarities in India and the US, but Sam goes on to make his points subsequently.
Taking this class really has taught me not to take everything I see at face value.
I grew up in a town where there were kids of certain ethnic groups playing sports that a person might not have thought they would have played based on their genetic make up.
Growing up I was never forced by my family into religion.
One time I met one girl and as I thought she was from Cambodia because of the darker skin and her eyes.
In contrast if you live in Florida you would most likely pick up a volleyball or basketball.
I've always thought Sam's story about his accidental conversion to Islamic faith was funny.
Either America has become too politically correct or our racial issues have never truly been settled.
One specific memory I have was when my group traveled to the city of Jerusalem.
That graph is no longer just a line on the screen, nor is it representative of a necessary evil in order to better the lives of the Afghan or Iraqi people.
LCT Garey explains that the Afghan people live regular lives just like ourselves, and that they had been living normally until conflict arose.
But at the same time I believe that it is talked about too much in the media because it brings so much attention to the news outlets reporting on issues about race.
The majority of white people and black people live in cohesion with no issues, yet the news finds the 1% that cannot and project it for the world to see.
Naturally, I decided to watch a clip from one of those two classes.
I agree that we live in a race driven society that needs to not be ignored anymore but instead make a change to.
What really struck a chord with me was when he talked about the inherent friendliness of the citizens and how they welcome you emphatically to share a cup of tea with them.
It was a great way that you used to analyze the a good argument about why is race a big deal in America.
Our skeletons are all made of the same bones.
I did not expect some of them to be what they said they were.
Most of these arguments take place publically for everyone to see on social media.
I believe that genetically and culturally, people as individuals are so diverse that we are far more different than we are similar to each other.
I found this lecture to be very eye-opening and made me really look forward to the other topics Sam will be discussing.
if they are all qualified and appropriate for the position or opportunity you give them all the same chance, then whoever is the best rightfully earns that position or opportunity because they deserve it, not because of their skin color.
Whatever country you immigrated from was the people you associated with in America.
Brooke, I have to agree with what you are saying, while it is more common in todays society for people of different culture to date and get married there are still some people out there who think this is wrong.
The DNA that was spread around the world is nearly identical, and the small differences that make us look so different are simply the result of people evolving in different climates and regions of the world.
I honestly never really gave much thought to what others believed in, but after hearing this lecture I really started to question it.
In Kabul, there are people that drive to work and come at night to their families.
Many people do have racial preferences but people shouldnt not like others because of their race.
The media's biggest goal is getting views and in order to get views, they are only going to show the most dramatic events, such as just showing ISIS and Taliban members, almost making it seem like they are the only people in Afghanistan.
I think more people need to think like you, in that race shouldnt set a boundary of attractiveness for people.
It is kind of hard to think of money when I have a brother who is in the military.
Overall, I was very interested in this clip as I was thinking about choosing it myself, and I really enjoyed your response.
As you said, race has been talked about for as long as most of us can remember, so personally, I cannot really imagine what that other perspective would be like.
There are REAL people living in Afghanistan with real families, jobs, and to think that they have to live in fear every day is truly traumatic.
I have always thought of everyone being unique and different because thats what society tells us today.
I most certainly agree with you that we must continue to speak about race issues.
The country is poor as it is and with the constant fighting, bombing, and disagreement is there any chance the country can grow and become better than it is now?
I do agree as well that I hope to see significant advancements within race relations in America and this topic can be spoken freely as well.
That image got me thinking about Mexican people and people from South America.
The amounts of noncombatants (civilians) who have been killed in wars, throughout history, have always been too high, but innocent people will always die in war.
I feel as though in the future interracial couples will be more prominent than the traditional couples of just black and black people together or white people being with each othe.
People tend to ignore what is happening because they feel no effect on the event.
The guy did however group most of the people from South America/ Central America together, which was pretty good on his part.
How hidden the issue is in many places around the globe is incredible and I do believe that putting a stop to the generalizations of a race and/or culture is a start in ending the race issues we face today.
When looking at migration patterns of humans they moved across landmasses that are no longer close together making people from completely different parts of the world have very similar features.
I was stumped that day but I really did feel comfortable and grateful that I was able to see how everyone was different but really we are all the exact same.
It is actually a little difficult for me to imagine growing up in one area, even if it were a big city.
People do not differ from one another as much as we think we do.
I think that this post brings up a really good point.
That is what the lesson showed us and we need to do something about it.
I have no idea what it would be like to live in a war zone, and I never want to find out.
We as a country do ignore what we did to the natives.
An example used in the article was food.
If they were to invest some time into getting to know a race that is different than their own, maybe they could relate and eliminate that sub category.
I think, especially with students, we try to be funny online, which a lot of times ends up being at the expense of someone else.
I can say though that throughout the years as I got older my opinions of faith definitely changed drastically.
I truly think that the world would be a much better place if we were all exposed to other cultures and learned more about one another.
Most people would have a hard time telling the differences between the Native Americans and Asians shown in the video, but I'm sure that people living in those areas would be able to tellrelatively easily.
What they are really saying is that they see everyone as white.
As genetic information moves people continue to pass down their physical features that can be tracked down to a part of the world that they no longer live.
I have always been skeptical of faith because I am a more logical thinker but this class has really verified the suspicions in my head.
I believe what develops the human being and shapes them is their experiences and mental formation.
Hopefully race can no longer be a topic of discussions once my generation has grown up, but I do believe it is going to take a long time.
It should be a legitimate concern or consideration when our government recommends using military force in a country.
After all the origins were revealed, Sam discussed what features on a persons face can let you know what ethnicity they most likely are.
However, just because a country is at war does not mean they are bad people, it is the bad groups we are after, not the whole country.
I believe stereotyping about race is unfair because people could be from any part of the world and look like they may be from another corner of the globe.
Another example he used was wearing a brown belt with black shoes.
I completely understand what you are saying!
Lastly, I want to express how everyday I go into this class and really enjoy it.
This is not necessarily privilege, but you can see how easily she can be mistaken for being white.
I believe that more people have to be informed of the reality of what is happening in the war and its affects on people's lives.
I think that people do not give enough credit to those around the world that deserve it.
The example Sam gave in class was that when you go to a restaurant you normally see people with light skin on the floor seating you, or waiting on you while those with darker skin are in the back making your food, or washing the dishes.
I dont know how many years it would take for the world to be multiracial but it is definitely on the rise.
It's all based on what people were taught as children.
I think this point is extremely valid, as that is the logic behind many individuals arguments.
I personally believe that moving towards a completely mixed race world will eliminate a great deal of the problems we have across the globe.
Racism in America has always been alive,but it has not been seen by people in power, due to the fact that they do not have to see it.
People need to admit they are ignorant.
I knew what racism is and had some theoretical knowledge limited to the school textbooks, but was never able to talk about it so freely and get such a good understanding about it.
Personally, I am a strong believer that anyone is capable of being decent at anything if they enjoy it and really want to be good.
I truly hope that they are having a good childhood although they are in a place of war.
Also, when you said that colorblindness is not a solution to race, thats exactly what I was thinking while I was listening to Sam talk about how we address race in America, I just couldn't put it into words.
I do not believe that we talk about race too much.
I have a younger brother who is currently in the Marines.
This video especially stood out to me because it talked a lot about peoples facial structures and how those unique traits can help you figure out where their ancestors came from.
Many are fighting and working towards peace, but are not getting there.
People are so dense in the way they understand race but you were spot on when you said that in order to solve these issues we have to UNDERSTAND.
I went to a predominantly white high school, so I was never exactly immersed in diversity throughout school.
Race is a common subject that is avoided because of the fear people have of being racist or unethical.
Make no mistake, racism exists in other parts of the world.
I feel like in society today when war is discussed, people from Afghanistan are spoken of in such a negative light.
I think people are dating outside of their race now more because of the sole reason love wins.
I have came in contact with a lot of people that come from different backgrounds.
This then leads us to believe that maybe the reason for certain races to participate in different sports could be a cultural effect.
Hearing about the different regions and how they define our skin color or how are noses are shaped made me realize how there is absolutely nothing dividing us in any way, shape or form.
In other countries people hate on each other based on what neighborhood they live in, who their parents are and what kind of jobs they work.
Removing the emotion in order to actually grow intellectually is hard because of the sensitivity.
Sam has a great teaching style and I wish majority of my classes were taught with this much enthusiasm and opportunities to get the class involved.
I never noticed how diverse the population around us was until I fully put things into perspective how different the facial structures can be and the different eye and nose shapes depending on what region they are from.
I had to go home and ask my parents how this was possible.
I also agree with your point of how when war or really any major event occurs, many people seem to only really care when they have some connection towards it.
I enjoyed that part of the lesson and hope to learn more like it.
Afghan soldiers fighting in this war really are just like us Americans or anyone else.
I also agree that it is important to accept your failures so you can learn from them and not push the responsibility onto other people.
I had never thought about race issues as just a big problem in the United States.
Not being a big fan of sports or even watcher of sports, apart from the soccer World Cup or The Olympics, I saw sports as a very racially diverse activity.
A lot of military strategists and psychologists argue that the targeting of civilians is an effective strategy to win a war.
I loved the way Sam incorporated this segment into that days lecture, because it again made me think.
It makes me so thankful that I have never been so closely exposed to the horrific scenes that war brings.
I am not a natural citizen and was laughing because of all these people saying they wanted to move out or insulting a nation because some dude got elected.
Even though the cultural difference is talked about by the people, but it is in a positive manner.
Therefore, I have always had this picture in my head of it being nothing but a war zone.
But I thought it was interesting that the two girls noses, chins, and eyes were compared, and clearly different, because they were from different parts of the world.
Keeping yourself to one preference is fine, but it can also keep you in a bubble.
The capital city of Afghanistan, Kabul, can be imagined as bombarded places with nothing but remains of buildings and mosque.
I think the example you gave regarding Canada and black people is pretty legitimate as you absolutely see hockey is a more predominant sport in Canada than basketball is.
Our society has destroyed our sense of community and acceptance and compassion to the point where no one will forget what our ancestors have done.
Also, Im almost surprised that Sam took a DNA test in the first place.
I had never thought of it that way.
Many people might think that we should get over it, but if nothing is done on the subject of racism, then there is still a world of ignorance and discrimination.
I never really understood what it was like in Afghanistan with all the war and violence that is happening over there.
Also being from India, I took my own understanding of this discussion as well, which is where saying This country was founded on racism, could be argued.
From a young age we have been pushed into thinking we are all different from one another and that no one is really like anyone one else because we are all unique.
Hi Stephanie, I agree with your statement on how Race is an issue here in the United States as well as all over the world.
I went to church for a little while but after experiencing it, I would never call myself a Christian.
Twitter and the internet is a great medium if you want a bunch of strangers to interact without fear of breaking the walls.
I had the same thoughts when Sam gave this lecture in class.
I think it is because that is all we were ever taught in school so we did not question the idea that Afghanistan really could be any different.
Pointing out towards slavery and the history of slaves gives a sold answer why race would be a complex thing in America.
Most of us were fortunate enough to be born or move to America where we have had the privilege to not experience war first hand.
Afghan men and women are encouraged to vote, but they do so by dipping their fingers in ink so they cant go to another ballot station and vote again.
That's why I was excited with the opportunity Penn State would give me, being such a large school.
Other countries are also great but the question of which country is the greatest is subjective.
I decided to do my response on Matching Ancestor Groups.
Rafis very own partner was murdered last year, and Rafi himself gets death threats regularly.
If there's one thing that this class is doing, it's making me think.
I think that race is a very interesting topic to discuss because it is something that everyone has an opinion on.
Most people who are in Afghanistan are experiencing war basically in their front and backyards, while we are only seeing and hearing about it on television.
I have also felt very uneasy and uncomfortable at times when having a discussion about race with others.
However, I disagree on your point that you think the United States is not or can never be the greatest country in the world.
He was unable to explain how this was any different than discriminating against people, stating only that dogs were too innocent to be treated in that way.
Usually it is just a key point brought up divulging from another argument.
Knowing that these people live lives so similar to us really puts a new perspective on the way that we view the war.
At the end think about this Race and color of a person are two different things.
Hearing about the suffering that American soldiers had inflicted on them was such a shock to me.
I have moved seven times in my life, in five different states.
However, I do believe economic status has something to do with it as well.
This all leads back to stereotyping which is a big part of the war and hurting innocent people on both sides of the war.
Not only do I think this applies to different countries that are at war, but also to people from two different backgrounds that may be in the same classroom.
Omar is from Saudi Arabia and has a strong Middle Eastern accent.
Everyone is trying to be too smart or knowledgeable that they forget to actually know something, not just say what they heard.
I agreed with many points but also disagreed with some.
For that reason, I think that the movement towards a less ethnocentric society will happen slowly as more and more young peoples ideas become the new social norm.
I believe he thought that group was of European decent though because of their lighter skin.
I feel as though this question, and many others having to do with dating someone of a different race, is such a hot topic in society right now.
It does seem that something like this can only exist in modern countries, but wrong speculation can really drive you off the right path.
I disagree with the statement that racism will be taught not to be tolerated because traditions will be passed down and children learn how to treat others based on their parents beliefs and actions.
It blew my mind because it was something I never really gave a thought to.
Overall, I think that race should be talked about more in general.
Then finally think about your earliest memory of who was different?
If someone based the American population off of the few bad Americans than it would be completely unfair and the same should be said about the Afghani people.
I admit that I can be quick to judge sometimes, however I do not think it is right to generalize people and their beliefs by putting them into certain groups.
I liked what your input about the movies and media aspect and how that shaped that you thought about Afghanistan and the people there.
Once you hit a certain age, dating becomes a real thing that people take seriously.
Therefore, I do not understand why people care.
Not only does this allow someone to hide behind a screen but this allows others to see it and believe whatever is posted online.
Most kids growing up play the sports that their parents allow them to.
I do not either, I still talk to others to be more aware of it.
Everyone talked the same and, for the most part, looked the same.
No one can 100% accurately pin point where everyone comes from.
I have to disagree with you on one point.
Sam seemed to think that the girl in the video was going to respond differently, which was interesting to me.
I feel like now I will be much more aware of peoples characteristics and wonder how those related to the past in aiding their ancestors in their survival.
I'm assuming it's as simple as that.
I'm shocked we didn't bring this up in class.
But I never really thought about why I felt this way.
When discussing race in class we should not have to feel like we need to beat around the bush trying to get our point across without hurting any feelings.
I see why Sam is doing this after watching the video and the exercise is cool and honestly funny.
Race I believe though will continue to be an issue in our world and it is the sad truth.
So personally the reason I think race is a big deal in our country is this.
Personally, it was fought about in my high school, debated in my English classes, and is present in a lot of my everyday life, realizing that people of the same race tend to stick together.
As am immigrant what I love about america is its oceans, its beaches and plains.
I'm a Criminology major an I'm in the final process for the United States Secret Service and I'm willing to risk my life to protect this freedom.
He said that they acknowledge the past and apologized for what had been done.
This class, in particular, has opened my eyes on my view of the world.
All people are different and most of these differences are due to where they come from.
I think my overall opinion is that sports tend to be fair and the better athlete usually gets to play.
Americais a fairly new country and its horrific past has not had enough time to heal.
If has to he will use what he learned to protect himself or his Marines brothers at any cost.
It's more of a culture thing and depends on how you were raised.
Or are we just classist and how do we know the difference?
The more exposure someone has to the sun, the more vitamin D gets absorbed into the skin and they get darker from that.
However, if people took ten minutes to research and get educated on Afghanistan, they would no longer make those generalizations.
If people were educated on other cultures maybe they would realize that people from all around the world are probably just like them.
He basically said that if he doesnt continue the work, or his sister, or his brother, who will?
I also agree with you that cultural mixing through dating can be beneficial.
But after delving into the implications of it in this post, I think it is just as much an important part of class as the lectures are.
This is something I naturally say but to them and their friends back home it was so bizarre.
Everywhere I've lived, there has been some sort of unifying culture -- whether it be accents or clothing -- to identify the people there.
I definitely don't have a bias toward one group of another.
It would be very different for me but I know my family would not frown upon it because a few of my family members date people of other races and nationalities and they are accepting of it so I know they would be fine with it.
African Americans back then werent really powerful so people try to do anything to get out of poverty.
I like how you highlightedthe population was headed toward a direction of mixed race people.
Or should we talk about it more?
In todays society interracial couples are seen much more than they have been.
This is clearly my own naivety, but there was never a reason for me to think too deeply about it.
All those groups had distinctive things about them even if the people were mixed.
I believe many issues that exist today would not exist in the future if everyone was multiracial.
That just proved to me looks are very deceiving.
As it stands now, people use negative reinforcement to talk about race.
Furthermore, the more the number of individuals are killed the more number of people who are affected increases by even more.
As you pointed out, no one is born racist, and we share a lot of similarities with one another.
I find it very interesting how to you said that you first felt uncomfortable discussing race with others because you were uneducated.
The reason I chose to respond to this is because I feel that there is so much to talk about on the subject, and I can go on about it for hours yet never come to a conclusion.
Paying attention to these details is vital to understanding different people.
His response was touching in my eyes.
People whose ancestors did not live close to the equator will therefore have a lighter pigmentation passed down through their genes.
How a whole country was built on racist principles.
Race is an issue that I think is very prevalent in the United States and people from other countries do not understand this.
So, in the future, when people say Afghanistan is only dust and bombed buildings, you will know that is not right.
Millenials, however, are sometimes perceived as having unrealistic or naive views on the world and are also dubbed the generation ruined by technology.
Through the years people of color have been categorized as only being good at specific sports and stereotyped as being more likely to advance in these sports compared to other ethnicities such as whites.
I grew up in the Midwest, so I have a strange long a accent that everyone always points out.
I also find it extremely interesting to listen to the way that others think and compare it with my own beliefs.
This picture compared to one of Afghanistan currently shows how the country has fallen into turmoil recently.
Race Mixing existed since the dawn of humankind, humans used each others traits.
I will never come to terms with the destruction and heartbreak that racial barriers have caused.
I was informed and learned that these people are really just like us.
The fastest way to get out of poverty was by getting into a sport thats why you see more blacks playing basketball and football.
This unconsciously leads them to be seen as racist, even though, that is not the case.
I really enjoyed this class as well and it was unfortunate that we only had about an hour to hear about such a complex subject.
I actually was the person in white who spoke near the end of the video regarding why race is different here than india.
When he first started grouping them I thought he put the girls together because they were white.
If I were living in Afghanistan, I would be stressed and worried all the time for my safety and my familys safety.
I had hard time adjusting to the idea of the factual part of science ever going against my faith, but I think it really is the person's choice to believe in how this all relates to make it all sense, after all we can never know everything.
As a child I did not know there were more than two religions, and finding out how many of other religions there are was very fascinating to me.
Throughout my lifetime, war has just been something that has remained a constant thing.
My father is a retired US Marine who fought in Kuwait during the Gulf War.
We are fighting these evil people and we are made to believe that all people who live in this area or have these certain beliefs are evil.
However, if Patriots star QB Tom Brady did something, there is feelings that the consequences would be less severe than a black player.
I went back to school after that break only to have them tell me a similar story in which they were hanging out with a group of friends and they used the term you guys.
However, when the question of racism in sports arose in class I started thinking in more detail about the racial differences in different sports.
I personally do not think that there is anything wrong with dating outside of your own race.
I have no idea where this mentality originated, but this lecture was extremely eye-opening.
Humans want to win.
This limits our chance to really explore our options, capabilities and understanding of the choices we make for our future.
I have never heard of white guys not wanting to date black girls that just seems so crazy to me.
I love to travel and agree with you that the world would be uninteresting without it!
Learning about Bassim - seeing pictures of his family, his house - then learning what happened to him and his family was heartbreaking.
People need to realize that it's 2017, and the only way to end a problem is to put a spotlight on it.
The demonstration made me recognize the conflict between the two schools of thought.
Race is a thing lowly discussed in Venezuela since our society is mostly governed by classism.
When LTC Garey talks about the Afghan patriot it really struck me.
But the real facts are that there are families who are trying to live a peaceful life.
People tend to remember things much longer when they read something online that makes them react strongly.
I think the girl who was speaking was spot on when she referred to it as exotic.
So you could argue that India has roots based on racism as well, but someone still turned out differently.
Also, I think some people just do it because they are attracted to that person, regardless of their race.
This example allowed me to apply this same notion to other things in life.
I feel as if I grew up to make progression through education and create a path to be followed.
Personally, I am hispanic and I have dated white men because of their looks and features that are the complete opposite of mine.
Your story about going to China is so interesting because it really exemplifies this idea.
This country was supposedly founded on equality and freedom for all when in reality that freedom was only afforded to a small group of ethnicities.
This is all because of the Eurocentric beauty standards, but going that route would lead me to write a four-page paper.
To me, breaking complex concepts down to the core of it makes it easier to understand.
A large portion of African Americans come from cities where basketball is more available and accessible to play vs. soccer, hockey, and golf.
At the end of the day, what does assimilating to the American society even mean?
It is possible that the race differences started out with different socioeconomic backgrounds, but it has evolved into cultural reasons based on what sports your parents and grandparents took part in.
Its hard for a news station to admit they do not know something, so instead they act like they know everything.
Essentially, they live normal lives besides the fact that they also live in a warzone.
After watching the end result and seeing who actually belongs together in terms of origin you can actually witness firsthand as to why Sam said no about asking for names.
However, I do not think that they will be in the majority any time soon.
I believe that societal pressures influence our perspectives of education.
I also thought it was interesting when Sam was talking about peoples noses and how they are shaped different ways to help in different climates.
But I loved the feedback given by your family and am intrigued as to what the exact results of your ancestry.com tests were.
My neighbor is actually working for the Secret Service right now, which he is on a presidential detail with President Trump.
When America was discovered, the prejudices against Native Americans only followed shortly after.
The opposite can probably be said for other team sports such as baseball where most players tend to be white so blacks may not get the same opportunity.
It is wrong to compare governments when each nation is based on different cultures and values to start with.
The moment where my mind turn a turn was when Sam said that over half of modern war casualties are civilians.
So overall I think talking about race and continuing protests for equality is important and a right that we should be thankful for here in the U.S.
By becoming conscious of those different cultures, we could begin to find differences in people we used to lump together as the same.
Trump has just upped the USs time there, but is that really beneficial to anyone?
We often look past that when we hear the name Afghanistan because this is a conflict zone.But in a closer setting - these people are just like us.
In Sams lecture he used hard logic to explain this statement, even going so far as to give the class a visual of a DNA test he took, which shows his African American ancestry.
Although I do believe that talking about race more in a civil way can only improve our society, I can see why some other people may have a different opinion.
I don't know whether this is a gender difference or just the people I've talked to about this, but it is quite puzzling.
When these people get into conversations where they are trying to be influenced that race does not affect other aspects to a person, things can become heated and a turn into a discussion that does no good and creates more tension then their was before.
I moved a lot and noticed cultural differences in places I've lived, but those differences would probably stand out more to you than me since I am used to encountering differences.
As a result of this negligence, we as a country never address the wrong that has been done and thus, we are unable to move on from it.
I completely agree with you about how this activity was one of the most interesting and engaging ones we have done in class so far.
In the past people were more comfortable with associating themselves with people of the same race/ ethnic group.
If we had, more than just our government and a select group of people would have spoken out by now.
This I cannot say, it's just something that I've noticed.
I would like to see sports expanding to different cultures just to see some of the effects it would have.
This relates to the treatment of fair skinned people compared to darker skinned.
It is just not called racismin these countries.
Some seemed to think that white guys are more adaptive to the cold which helps in hockey and that black guys typically have longer legs and a shorter torso to help with basketball.
You make a good argument that the U.S. by far has one of the worst racist histories to date.
The media plays a huge role in this as well and Im glad you pointed this out.
They explainedthat Czechs hold the Romas (alsofrequently referred to as gypsies) in very low regard and are heavily discriminated against.
I think this topic should be brought up again because it was only covered in like three minutes of class.
It puts a bad stereotype in our heads as Americans on how a place that has been so war stricken could be more similar to the United States than different.
Its sad to think that a lot of people believe that they are all horrible people.
It is extremely important for people who make national security decisions to consider that.
To me it is all about how you personally take the situation on race.
I really enjoyed reading your posts and your views on the video.
I grew up in a predominantly white neighborhood and went to a mostly white high school.
Firstly, this is blatant indoctrination and also it makes little to no sense.
It was cool that I was getting noticed.
When I talk to some of my friends from eastern Asia, they all generally have different dialects.
Many people are even uneducated on where they come from.
I have never really travelled much outside the United States so I think it would be safe to say I am not too cultured.
However, I don't think that racism is being made more prominent due to recent events.
They do this just to avoid getting a tan.
Being a short person myself, I wonder how height is affected by the different climates.
We have so many similarities to Afghanistan, yet they are being affected by this war.
Samantha, I too agree that sometimes we do talk about race too much but it is because we have to.
Do they learn more about each other?
The thing is we cannot exactly know, scientific proof may be part of God's plan in my belief.
Do we talk about race too much?
Not sure if I'm making too much sense but I feel like someone will have to understand what I am saying.
Hes very new to the United States and has a slightly difficult time speaking clearly while speaking English.
It has not changed.
The first girl who said her name and nationality was named Angie and she was from Cuba but looked like any typical white girl living in the United States.
Because there is no war here in the United States, we do not see how our military is doing in other countries.
I agree this lecture really stood out to me as well.
I feel as though this narrative is never really discussed nationally in the media.
All the stories he tells of meeting all of these people who are nothing like me, all these young kids who are so much smarter than we are, fills me with jealousy.
I think that in 50 years, there will be many more people who are mixed races playing all sports and making them less dominated by one race.
We all are the same in that we categorize people and believe what we say.
When all the students revealed their different backgrounds, I was shocked.
While these differences should be celebrated, unfortunately, some are socially more desirable than others.
I do agree that there is always the exception to the rule in these situations.
Many parents raise their children to believe as they do, not giving them a voice or the freedom to build their own perceptions of the world and its people.
Things aren't getting better andits something we should be informed about.
I agree with you that most people believe that the different phrases and accents they carry is the right way to speak.
The first being the caste system it is true that caste system existed in India but since independence in 1947, it has been outlawed and those who did belong to the lower caste's get special reservations fromthe government.
I think that African Americans have certain genetics that allow them to be fast.
This video brings up the topic of dating outside of your race.
Now I look around and think to myself about how could I ever have thought this.
Race is definitely not something only the US faces, but the US plays a huge role in helping to bring awareness to the problem no one really wants to confront or admit is occurring.
This is also linked with your thoughts that it is the older generations ahead of us that still are having problems with individuals of different races dating.
I mean we had a black president not long ago, how could race not be talked about.
While we aren't anywhere near reaching the level of communication and acceptance that we could ideally be at, I believe that society in general has begun to open up and become more willing to listen to other people's ideas, thoughts, and opinions that may differ from the ones that they were raised hearing.
I remember being with her and we approached a group of my Latino friends.
I had to choose the darkest person in the room and that simple observation was very powerful for me.
Many people are unaware, or choose to turn their heads, when they see acts of racism.
This realization really hit me when Sam showed us the picture of Rafis daughters on the screen.
They are worried about what they will think about having a boyfriend or girlfriend outside of the typical relationship norms.
The world needs to continue to discuss racial problems, but instead of arguing we need to work together to understand one another.
This picture showed three Afghan women happily walking down the street dressed in normal clothes like shorts above the knee.
And to think of sexual reproductionin that aspect, it is very cool to know.
I disagree that what divides us is our national pride.
Overall, I agree and love your post!
But sometimes I don't understand why it isn't the case in the USA.
Moreover, as you said all are equal!
I also think that the categories people are put in are pointless because they rarely ever apply to that person.
Individual sports are an example where there is no racism involved and the best player wins.
I believe that in addition to what you said about the ignorance the people in this country harbor, there is also a prevalent tendencyof dividing and separate people into different boxes and stereotypes.
Love is love and people should not subject themselves to just dating people of the same race.
Remember I choose to go this school and knew what I was getting into.
Overall, I found this talk to be something fascinating.
We didn't talk about it in the lecture but it would be nice to learn a little about that.
I agree with Domenic and all the examples she gave regarding the white supremacists.
Anyone who dismisses an entire race of women/men is also prejudice and should be called out for it.
I believe the thing that separatesAmerica from the rest of the nations is that we have individuals who are more willing to speak up about the injustices in our society.
It is the only way to be politically correct.
It this state of being so vulnerable is when the real learning happens.
Then slavery followed and the men who could abolish it did nothing.
The picture were an example of how most people for example in the US see all other countries around the world, without knowing the whole spectrum of the reality of those countries.
Generations that have come before us would most likely disagree in the idea of dating outside their race.
I have been to European countries like Germany and Austria where there are plenty of white people who look like me.
It is an unfortunate fact but, it is true.
It is so interesting that humans can be 99% similar genetically, however look so different such as different shaped eyes, noses, skin pigmentation, hair, body shape, etc.
Regarding India, as Sam mentioned as well, the caste system also discriminated against people of darker skin because it made them easily identifiable to the lighter-skinned, upper-caste citizens.
We are all made of the same material.
I agree that emotions do play a huge role on this subject because it is so sensitive.
Like he said, it isn't until you travel and actually visit those places that you realize the real potential other places in the world really have and that not everything posted online represents their true colors.
In the 1970s when they had afros, it was a symbol of the Black Power Movement.
The main concern, however, should always be American lives.
Our world needs to teach the young to love one another no matter what race.
People judge darker skinned people for being the color they are but it relates back to their ancestors and the region of the world they lived in.
In states that are primarily cold, there will be majority playing hockey or snowboarding for entertainment.
Racism affects a very broad range of individuals, and denying them important rights and removing necessary variables from life to prosper for them, racism is and constantly will be a topic of discussion in America.
I just wished Sam covered the topic of interracial dating a lot more.
Personally for me when I am contemplating dating someone I dont really look at a persons race I more see them for who they are.
However, with more and more races coming together and having kids, these differences are slowly disappearing.
compared to if you asked a group of white people you would get very different answers.
Hearing the emotion in his voice as he spoke about his family, overcoming his anger, and being grateful to be alive put the war into an entirely new perspective.
I believe a similar thing could continue to help with race issues.
I find it interesting that you found this portion of the lecture to be so eye-opening because I reacted very similarly.
To tie all of this together, people are dating outside their race because of the fact that they just do not care about the color of another individuals skin.
When he finished grouping everyone I thought he did a actually did a good job.
Race is an issue in the United Sates, and I think the main separation lies in the color of skin, not necessarily where people are from.
Like Rafi said in class, he and most other Afghan people are peaceful people.
So the farther north you go the more white people there are so therefore you see that hockey is a thing of whites.
I think you make an interesting point that news coverage could spend air time hosting debates on the latest issues.
Similarly, before moving here I never really identified myself as a minority or brown, I just saw myself as Puerto Rican.
Also, I feel that location and culture plays a factor.
She stayed in hostels and traveled cheap, but she managed to keep her budget in check.
I can definitely agree with many that the country was founded on racism.
When we heard Rafi speak about his experiences in Afghanistan, I began to understand what that meant.
The best solution for this would be for people to be more open and actually make an effort to get to know other people, who necessarily don't look like them or live where they do.
I believe it is a big issue that still needs to be discussed.
I think it is out of comfort and what they are used to rather than them just simply not having an interest in someone who is a different color than them.
I did find it inspiring to hear Rafis reasoning behind continuing on with his work in such a time of violence.
I experienced this amiability first hand when I went to Israel this past summer.
I agree with you that we must educate ourselves before we are so quick to judge those who live in that part of the world, or make an opinion on war in general.
If people make themselves more aware of what places like where Rafis family is from is really like, it will allow more empathy to be realized.
This intimate intertwining of social constructs and racial elements has therefore created the need for more conversation on racism and it how affects people, due to its inherent influence within contemporary America.
The proper way a typical American, who has not visited the country yet, should answer that questions is.
I also enjoy learning more about other cultures and traditions that are different from mine.
Therefore, just because there is a certain race that overshadows in a sport, does not make sports in general inherently racist.
I believe that as the populations continue to mix the problems of race will go away.
We've seen it constantly, and we've tried to protect our inner communities.
The chart that Sam showed detailing Afghan civilians killed now puts an enormous knot in my stomach.
He said in India they talk about race in terms of colorism.
Those desires could lead people to believe that their group is better than another, which can cause some issues.
I think the topic of interracial couples is a very prominent issue that is seen a lot in our world.
It could be a physical attraction to someone that appears exotic since he or she has a different race.
It never dawned on me the number of civilians lives war takes.
If you don't travel, you truly just don't know about other cultures.
In reality we are all equal just adapted to different parts of the world.
I think that people tend to make assumptions about poverty and expect certain races to be the ones who are considered poor or not well off, when in fact all races experience the same difficulties and struggles in life.
In psychology last semester, I learned that people have a natural tendency to blame others for there failures, but give themselves the credit when they succeed.
Hockey players benefit from being top heavy so that they can hit harder on the ice, whereas basketball players benefit from being taller and quicker.
Maybe it seems that the country is just not financially thriving right now with the war which makes sense why they dont have electronic ballots.
Now over the generations, these second class citizens will tire of being second class and will start to demand rights and freedoms.
I believe this taboo has been put to rest for people with an open mind but I think other people would never do it.
The huge issue with these myths and stereotypes is that they grow out of a long history of a limited understanding.
I do not believe we are 99.9% the same.
Sam bringing this up in class makes all of us more aware of the issues that we are often blind to.
We will never know the truth until we eventually pass away, but having faith in any story is critical in how we live our lives on a daily basis.
Families exist with the same hopes and goals that we have here.
To continue, it was devastating to see the bar chart that showed the increasing amount of afghan civilians killed over the years.
Why does race even matter?
In summation, the mixed race will eliminate or reduce racial tensions, provide protection from many diseases both foreign and domestic, benefit the ongoing progress of interracial relationship statistics, and create a safer and more inclusive atmosphere and conversation about race.
There is so many normal things going on in the country that it really is just like here.
I'm sure anyone will catch my drift here, but especially anyone who is from an upbringing like mine.
He felt as though he wasnt given the same opportunities as others.
However it was interesting for me when I saw so many natural citizens say they hated this nation and such when Trump got elected.
Some might argue and say that learning about other countries is irrelevant and we should stay within our region.
Thats why I found your response so interesting because I never really looked or noticed that hair types and nose sizes can actually help determine your ancestry.
Saif is from Egypt and is also new to the US.
Obviously a civil situation is ideal but even if it is not an ideal situation it can still be worth it in the end in order to create significant change.
While most of Sams lectures have brought up many different points and perspectives on some topics I had only some limited knowledge on, this one really changed my point of view.
If my understanding is correct, racism as something against minority communities is more prevalent in the rural parts of America and as you move towards the urban center of the state, you find that people are more open and accepting towards someone from a minority community.
I totally agree with the take home message of this post.
I probably would of guessed the same if I had to group people together quickly.
The core concept of this class is about making connections to and with people, finding distinctions and traits that allow us to figure out how to understand how people other than ourselves tick.
Differences should be celebrated, not washed away.
I thought it was very interesting when LTC Garey from the U.S. army gave a simplistic description about what an ordinary Afghanistan citizen is like.
We are fundamentally the same in that we are all able to think what we want.
I think that he was saying that it doesnt make sense but that is the way people think.
I have uncles, cousins and grandparents who have all served in the military and they always would tell me stories about how they lost someone that was close to them or in their particular station.
I also agree with you when you say that past history may not repeat itself if we all have open minds and are willing to go out and experience things for ourselves.
The reason why I would feel uncomfortable in the past was because I was very uneducated in all racial issues since they were never properly discussed in any elementary, middle, or high school.
Indigenous people from parts of Asia have very similar facial features to those who are from parts of Europe close to Russia.
When Sam pulled up an image of Raffi's children in their little pink dresses it made me realize how little most Americans know about Afghanistan.
I found the lecture video, Pay Attention to Distinct Differences, to be intriguing due to being in college and actually noticing the different languages and different features of people in order to figure out the culture or country an individual is from.
I enjoyed this response and also connected with that video.
I think a lot Rafis discussion dealt with peace, and people realizing the reality of people around the world, and essentially not to judge them or come up with these preconceived notions that many people hold.
As for your personal example of not knowing you were black...I grew up in Miami surrounded by fellow Latinx people, all of them knowing I was also Latina just white with blonde hair and blue eyes.
But for some reason we as a species believe that we are different from each other.
My take on religion other than brainwashing is that people need something to help them build a foundation for their beliefs, morals, and values.
You would play this in cold areas which allowed it to become part of certain cultures.
I agree that the media only shows us the evil, they do not look at the civilians living there or any of the good parts.
Despite this, they are the future of the world, as Sam claims.
In the Latino community, lighter skin is seen as more elegant and clean.
So, dating a white person isnt the best idea for them.
We generalize and put people into classes, however we really are all the same.
I forgot about their homes, their shopping malls, their parks, their streets and so on, that are just like ours.
People usually put race in a negative light instead of actually encouraging change in the world.
But despite these differences in the way we look, we are still 99.9% the same as one another.
Be kind to each-other for we all have struggles.
The class dynamic revolves around students and how they respond and act, so twitter gives a new dimension to our class by allowing those who maybe would not speak before, to have a voice and participate without having to get too anxious.
I'm not sure exactly why this is.
So in my mind, Asians were Asians and Africans were Africans.
For the most part,we see white men who dont date outside of their race.
This is not to say all, but many older people are stuck in their ways about how they perceive people of other races.
There is so much more to be exposed to race that it cannot just be learned or improved from just a simple talk of a tiny part of it.
It is no coincidence that both of these countries typically have very cold climates.
With the exception of 9/11, we have not yet been in the middle of war in our country.
It sounds very dramatic, I know.
Only seeing destruction on the news gives a perception of that being what the Middle East is, its simply just not true.
I am hopeful that this conversation will make people bolder and not just do what may be comfortable for them.
Not at all and anyone who thinks so is just not educated.
I felt wrong in some sort that I did not view or see Afghanistan as a normal place before the war.
Although it isn't the same thing, I watched a documentary called White Helmets that pertained to the issues in Syria.
I responded to the video titled Do We Talk About Race Too Much?
Its what makes us each individuals unbound to any set standard of philosophy or political affiliation.
It isnt easy to put yourself on the spot in front of a class thats this big.
The one student who argued that our country was built on racism is a point I can agree with.
War is the most unfortunate necessity, it will always happen and innocent people will always die.
I feel that there are a million ways to discuss this topic and I'm very interested in hearing alternative opinions.
While I am mostly of European ancestry, my grandmother comes from Peru.
Having someone just like us give concrete examples of how we are actually all so similar was something I believe we all needed to hear.
Your point on the radical minority being the ones with the most exposure is very important when talking about the news and race issues.
I also cannot believe that people would decide to not date someone because of their race.
I agree with your thoughts that dating outside of race used to be taboo but it is now changing.
My brother and I had a conversation a couple months ago about how race won't be an issue in the future.
African Americans are born differently than white Americans.
Although it didnt come as that big of surprise to me, I felt shocked hearing Sam say that Rafi regularly experiences death threats and that they recommended he have a guard at all times.
A black male responded that he and his friends were more likely to have hung a poster of basketball players on their bedroom wall in comparison to hockey players.
It would be nearly impossible for one race to be considered superior or inferior to another when the world's majority is a mix of various races.
I had lived in southern Virginia as a kid before moving to Ohio.
Which in the middle of the video shows that they actually were from there.
Overall I thought this exercise was really interesting because it shows that it is very hard to judge a persons nationality just by looking at them.
People only started really trying to reform race policy in the 70s as a response to institutionalized racism.
Several studies document that race has been shaped by cultural, political, ideological and legal functions in society.
People are not born racist, but raised racist.
It is true that you can never truly understand a culture or region until you have fully immersed yourself in it, but you can get a better idea than the average person just by doing some research.
I love that you brought up stereotypes in football.
It sounded like it was taken straight from a movie scene.
I totally agree with everything you said in your response.
I think the facial futures helped him decide what group to put them in.
Being a lower class citizen does not make someone less entitled as a human being.
So truth be told not having much experience with race makes it very uncomfortable to talk about when it is brought up in the media constantly.
Race is such a touchy subject but have you ever stopped to think about why?
Samantha, I do understand what you are saying regarding this lecture but I personally believe that race is not talked about enough in the right way.
I try not to ever really think too much about war, because it saddens me that instead of peacefully communicating with other countries, we turn to violence as our form of communication.
I can logically assume that I share other classes besides this one with international students, but I am regularly never made aware of such a thing, so I am grateful to Sam for introducing me to such diversity within my classes.
After being exposed to that much trauma I really respect how kind hearted Rafi and his family remain.
All in all, I definitely believe that sports are not inherently racist.
The idea of dating in general sparks a lot of conversation across the board.
But also in that class I remember him showing us a picture of a track meet with Usain Bolt in the lead crossing the finish line and every one else in the picture was black.
As harsh as it sounds, its true.
Everyone would simply be mixed.
So I think the public should also be more open minded to see different races people getting together because the race should not be the gap for people to fall in love.
But this does not stop the women from using skin-lightening creams and even shield themselves in the hot blazing sun by wearing gloves, hats, and long sleeves.
The true reason why people are dating outside their race is because it has become less of a problem.
It is also interesting that you said that white men objectify women of color because they are foreign to them instead of understanding who they are.
If traveling is something you are passionate about, set a goal for yourself to go somewhere else in the world for at least ___ amount of time at least every ___ months/years.
For the most part, I think we see these two groups dating outside of their race the most is because it became a trend.
There would be no way for people to hate or dislike someone based off of their ethnic background because in that case you would be necessarily hating yourself because everyone is of the mixed race.
I think that everything you stated was put very nicely and I completely agree with your opinion.
Most U.S. media portrays Afghanistans people as extremists who know nothing but war and who hate the United States.
That being said I know exactly what you mean when you say you felt like you didn't have a right to talk about race.
Yes part of what they assume might be right but its irrelevant to the fact that they do not know.
Despite the students in each group looking similar, almost every group was matched incorrectly.
And when it comes to beauty I feel that it really depends from people to people.
It makes me sad to see how the war is affecting people in Afghanistan.
Sometimes I feel that fact is lost in our quest for racial progress.
Sams lectures really open up my eyes to see the world through different perspectives by putting myself into others shoes.
With that being said, there is no correct creation story.
From this lecture, specifically this part of it, I came to the realization that once again there is so much that I do not know.
I never thought of people, let alone people with families and ambitions just like you or I.
All of us here at Penn State want to get great jobs, and in order to do that it usually requires a very good grade point average.
I thought to myself and I did not really care he called me that.
This class has helped me put faces to these people that we make out to be monsters, and recognize that not every person that lives in that part of the world is automatically the bad guy or a terrorist.
Im very open to dating outside of my race because you can find compatibility and chemistry with anyone.
This lesson was a good way to show us how much we depend on looks to figure who someone is.
I will say in my personal experience, I definitely have found certain people of all races to be super attractive, I just have never myself dated someone of a different race.
I think this may happen in the future all over the world once everyone is multiracial.
In order to alleviate a lot of the tension around the issue of race, it needs to be talked about in a respectful and understanding manner.
I also only knew of Afghan people from the American mass media which is sad to say.
You're also right when saying everyone has insecurities.
I agree with you as well and I also think that a lot of our perspective on Afghanistan has to do with the media that we are exposed to.
Hopefully all of us who attended the lecture and watched the video will take that feeling with us into the future and make those decisions down the line.
I would hear bits and pieces of what it said and couldnt believe how specific it was.
Rafi is bringing it upon himself to make the world around him a better place and I could not respect him more for what he is doing.
Like LRC Garey talked about, the people of Afghanistan are more similar to US citizens than they are different.
It allowed you to learn so much more about the world and war without having to leave the classroom.
Do you feel worrisome that this is the case?
The fortunes were small, yet she still wanted everything that she could get her hands on.
In class this past week when Sam switched up the roles we spoke about how in real life black people with a clean record are less likely to be hired than white people with a criminal record in certain situations.
Many countries are knowledgeable about the United States, but as mentioned in class, not many Americans understand different countries' cultures.
And honestly, it is a little weird to think that their country is like ours, except more poor.
Because of this, we choose not to see they are the same as us and we act blind to our similarities.
We sometimes do not realize that there are families and children that are affected so much by the war.
The stories were good and I connected with them all of them but it would have been a better experience if he went into depth on why we were over there.
I think it is very unfair for people to make judgement on other cultures until they have actually learned what they are all about.
The media truly fails to show the most beautiful parts of this country.
What I found most interesting about this video is the deep cultural roots expressed from the Afghan people.
I chose to go back to look at this video because divorce is something that interests me.
Meaning, why is it that my specific denomination of Christianity is so correct and all other denominations such as the Jehovah, Baptists, Catholics and so forth wrong.
Its hard to wrap our minds around the fact that people can live a normal life and have hopes and dreams on the front lines of war.
They wake up and work and strive to create the best opportunity for themselves and for their families.
It is very hard to imagine something of this extent happening.
In my opinion, the thought of Afghanistan may not seem real to people because we are not physically living in the country.
the Iraqui person that enlightened us is a true example of this.
That people like Rafi can and have been killed for speaking out against this violence.
As LTC (Lieutenant Colonel) Garey is talking to the other men in the meeting, he is told that the Taliban Commander is sitting right next to him on the couching, sharing tea and stories along with the other men.
Simply if the wife is unhappy, what are the restrictions regarding that?
Sam brought up imagining creating a system of law from the Quran, given that it is such a small book.
They didn't choose to be born into a country that is constantly putting their lives at risk and causing them to worry about things that we couldn't even imagine thinking about here in the States.
When comparing the two, his actions seem that much greater.
However, we do have similar aspects of Sharia law in our country.
When bombs are dropped, the houses that get destroyed and the lives that get taken are from innocent civilians who had nothing to do with the war.
Its not fair because its clear to see that there are a lot of normal civilians with normal children that want nothing more than this war to end but can only hope for survival.
Rafi said that Afghanistan citizens are peaceful people and that his job as a lawyer involves spreading peace.
But I do agree that this would definitely aid the soldiers success in completing their assigned tasks while at war.
This was especially poignant because when you set back and think about it, are you or even one of your family members going to just invite a stranger into your home, a foreigner at that, and be that hospitable?
Everybody is always looking for their purpose in life and Rafi has found his by trying to create peace his country.
The atmosphere felt motionless and time seemed to stand still when we were lectured about the accidental U.S. bomb that killed family members and destroyed houses of Bassim and his family.
My uncle went to Afghanistan for nine months and I do not believe he saw any combat while there.
We all have trouble forgiving people for problems that now seem so insignificant but he was able to do it.
And I think we all know what we call that, a dictatorship.
With that goal in mind, I think it is capable to accomplish that with also eradicating the oppression.
I dont think that necessarily means all Middle Eastern people are nicer than Americans but I do think it was important to hear that people with those values and generosity do live there.
It helps them reconcile the seemingly vast differences into small, bitesized pieces of information that hopefully, makes it easier to swallow and comprehend.
However, when a terror attack is done by a Christian no one seems to even mention a religion, it is somehow a mental health issue.
Hello, I also am a speech therapy major and I didn't make that connection at first but it is a really unique thought.
This was interesting because the news media hinders our view on what the other side of war is actually like.
I recently discussed how there are more interracial couples that are prominent in todays society and how the world will soon become a bunch of mixed races.
This process will not be easy, but it is exactly why we need to start doing it now.
We are not being informed of what is actually happening.
Just because someone is associated with Afghanistan does not make them a bad person and because of what we grew up hearing about the country, I feel, is where Islamophobia comes from.
NATO requested this dialogue, which is what led Dr. Richards to Rafi.
In my opinion, though, I think we all need to do a better job at forgiving small things in life because we never know when we will lose lights in our life.
Divorce was not really an option and people were to be faithful and work through whatever issues may occur within their marriage.
There are real people with real families that are being affected.
The church has been incredibly deceitful in how they have portrayed the message of the Bible.
It is commonly believed among outsiders of the culture that they are backwards and have a man dominated society.
This is important because it really brings a big military operation down to a really humanistic manner.
I'm happy to hear that it changed your view on the Afghan people.
Living with such a childish mindset closes everyone from understanding someone's else drought.
These people use the bible as a guide and there are millions of pages that tells people how they should live their lives.
In general, war and military operations are one of the most stressful situations that mankind may ever have to face, and to see the smiling soldier shows the inherent humanity in us all that even when we are at odds with each other, there are times that we must stand back and try to make the best of our situation.
I cannot agree with you more Brielle.
Hearing Rafi and Bassim each speak about their different experiences on the war and how their lives have been affected truly touched my heart and made me think.
Bear in mind that the Quran is a very old holy book which tells you that it was teaching people how to go on with their lives more than 1400 years.
After hearing this lecture, I realized that majority of Afghanistan people are nice and they are willing to respect others.
Even though things are better now than they were back then, that doesn't mean that discrimination is dead.
This is one thing that I believe needs to be addressed in our country.
When the bible is interpreted as it is stated, to love thy neighbor as one loves thyself some great things happen such as donations, and different humanitarian projects, but when the Bible is interpreted to hate gays, and people of opposing religions some equally as horrible things happen.
Rafi's love for his home however is heartwarming.
I am sure I am not the only one who feels this way.
We have such a skewed perception of the military and hearing LTC Garey's words about the normality and kindness of the Afghan people was really inspiring.
If 9 out of 10 people in a society are heterosexual, the one person who is not is going to be viewed as the one in the wrong by default.
Currently I am a junior and my brother made sure I took this class before I graduated.
We are not robots and, in general, we know that going and killing someone is wrong  so why are we so careless with the lives of so many?
This judgmental behavior is a major global problem that has had an effect on mankind for years.
I also found Lieutenant Colonel Gareys talk to be eye-opening.
We need to understand the people living in the war zone and hopefully eliminate stereotypes.
Things like that, should be a focus, because a nation is not characterized just by its political conflicts.
Yes, the war in Afghanistan has been going on for entirely too long, but what do you do when a country doesn't want to rule itself?
Although its easy to talk about what should have been done in hindsight, Raffi ultimately made the right decision to not react radically and allow time to heal his wounds.
First, he starts by saying that this idea of soldiers constantly risking their lives and fighting is not true.
There can also be similar conflicts with the other side that do not have to end in violence.
I agree with you on how the perspective of Afghanistan has been shaped by movies and other media.
Yet, I feel that many people including myself don't take the time to notice distinct differences in other people.
I did not realize the specificity of the text, because so many people interpret it differently.
One thing that I think would be very beneficial for the American society is greater understanding of the causes and impacts of wars.
Some would even dare to say, they shouldn't have been born in a area of war.
I mean how can you truly repay someone after killing some of their family?
But does that mean that all Christians are bad?
Although it would change my life in every aspect I think that it would be a really life altering experience.
because it really got me thinking during class.
If they do not actually know anything about their culture, then they could interpret something the wrong way and things can go bad.
Until we hear it right from the mouth of someone that has experienced it, we dont realize it could be any of us.
I agree that we are blinded by our privilege.
This week I am choosing to respond to the clip What the Quaran says About Divorce.
But thats because people have always understood people, Shakespearean literature gets a lot of the aspect of the human personality right, doesnt mean he is right about fairies and witches and spirits.
If you are black and driving through my home town, there is a much greater chance of getting randomly pulled over and have your car searched than if you were a white person.
People have the Bible into saying what they want it to say.
A big part of the job is connecting with the local people and not fighting twenty-four seven.
Sam pointed out in class that there are many other factors other then homosexuality that makes one unworthy to enter heaven.
Do the people of Iran have the same misconception about Americans that Americans have about Iranians?
What if it were that the person taking the oath does not believe in a god?
I would be interested in what the rules are for women that do not have a reason to leave their husband.
The points you made about full filling our basic needs stood out to me also when Sam talked about it.
They have more maners than us and yet were going into their welcoming homes with the thought to kill these evil people.
Now, he will not even be compensated for his losses.
It brought up many points that I guess I was aware of but never really thought about.
Moreover into marriage, as explained in the video, men cannot possibly just simply divorce women out of the blue.
I think It is hard to determine all the sets of laws and rules about everything in one text.
Even the idea of war and what it means is not thought about enough.
It may be easier to put our minds at peace by generalizing the people going to war against us, but it is not right.
They are people just like us and I bet that they are even better human beings than what we are.
The lesson l took away from this lecture was that you have to take the books with a grain of salt.
However, I cant say I can do the same for Afghanistan.
I learned about it during my government class as we had a large amount of discussion about the government and religion, and all of the checks on it from the establishment clause to the Lemon test, which is 3 different ways in which the US government can not establish a government.
Innocent people are being killed everyday, and Sam helped us realize in class that its not just the bad guys doing the killing.
After reading that slide that Sam used and interpreting it in a literal sense, almost everyone in the class realized they would not be able to go to Heaven if they followed it.
When Sam showed the slide the displayed the casualties of Afghan civilians, I couldnt believe it.
Rafis good friend was murdered, for working at making Afghanistan more peaceful.
I think we need more people like Colonel Garey to showcase how that part of the world is not all strictly war and darkness.
What I have learned is that everything is perspective, if you're accustomed to one lifestyle then it's just the way you are.
After hearing Sam and LTC Garey talk about how generous the people of Afghanistan are, and having Rafi in our class to speak, I realized that not everyone is the same.
I think the media tries to portray Afghanistan as the fire of this war.
Instances like this are exactly what this topic of war affecting real people was about.
At the least, I think it encouraged everyone to become more aware of the things that are occurring.
Since he told the class this actually really makes you think about that.
The pain, and fear that Raffi experienced when he first learned of his wife and nephews death is a feeling I hope to never have.
He said how every time he would attend his team meetings the Afghans would bring all these gifts even though the average monthly income in Afghanistan is $300 if that.
Everyone has their own perceptions of other cultures because of how the media portrays them.
Since everyone has different opinions and beliefs despite their faith, I feel that Christian Sharia Law would not be ideal for our society.
99% of Muslims are innocent people and just want to live their lives.
He will not stop fighting until there is peace because he believes peace will always win.
But its unfair to lump an entire country with a few bad eggs.
Rafi, the speaker that came in to talk to our class talked about how the Taliban disagrees with Sharia Law and how he receives death threats daily for being an attorney for this law.
Once students graduate high school and move onto college, history of war tends to be no longer discussed due to the fact that most students aren't taking war or history related courses.
What I learned from this video is that Bible has its flaws in that it does not answer every question ever about how to get to heaven.
The media sensationalizes the war being full of evil people trying to do evil things to our world.
But its not okay to leave your thoughts there.
Saying that reverse racism exists is also simultaneously ignoring the bigger issues of real discrimination.
I really appreciated Sam taking the time to speak about what Sharia Law is and the stereotypes that surround it.
I believe building a country on slaughtering a different race and erasing their culture could be the origin of this complicated issue and a deep-rooted problem that inherited from Greek culture/ tradition, which is treating some races inhumanly, indeed aggravated the race issue in this country.
I think this initiative is very important if we truly want to help Afghanistan and other countries to get out of this war state, and it really does help us gain a better understanding of what the loss is really like in these countries.
Like I said before, my dad is a divorce lawyer and constantly deals with unhappy people.
The radicalization of the Bible by people like BLANK, will never happen in places like America and other first world countries because the views and people of a modern society would never allow it to control them.
I think it is human nature to want to protect your family in times of danger and just run away from all of it.
I thought it was amazing what Lieutenant Gary was able to share with us.
This far-right, alt-right or extremist group is basically looking for the extinction of every minority group as they see the white race being superior to all.
However, I think when it comes to divorce for any religion it is a very sad reality.
It was very interesting to listen to the Colonel talk about how he didn't know much about the Afghan people except for that they were raised in war.
He lost things that he cannot get back or replace, even with time and money.
But, on the other hand, Rafi gets death threats every single day, just for doing the work he does in his country, which is essentially, promoting peace.
How can we justify losing one life over another?
But I do believe that we need to rid the world of that 1% of bad people in every population because all they do is hurt and threaten the innocent.
I also couldnt believe Raffis reaction to his family members death.
Dr. Richards talks about how important dialogue is, especially between military personnel and civilians.
How would they be able to live in such a foreign country without even learning anything about the people?
I for one didn't think about it that way.
We are taught to hate Muslims and those in Afghanistan because of what our government portrays to us.
Seeing that mall personifies the mothers that were shopping there and children on their way to school.
Dr. Sam Richards adds to the video clip about how generous and giving and how he has experienced their hospitality as well.
Any time I heard of, learned about, or saw pictures/videos of the country, I always seemed to be seeing it was just areas of sand, dirt, and fighting.
When we are at least aware and educated, it is easier for us to form valid judgements and helps to eliminate misunderstanding.
I agree that certain sports are more popular in particular regions and because of the resources that are available, and because of that have become a culture aspect.
Rather than just respecting the players for their performances on the court and field, people feel the need to point out their race and how their genetics of background is the reason for why they are mainly in one sport or the other.
My dad would be my biggest hero if he was doing the same thing for America if we were in the same position.
Something else that sparked thoughts and questions in my mind is military reform.
I dont want to make any assumptions, but it tends to follow that whenever I have discussions with individuals who have actually read their religions texts, they are usually less radicalistic about their views.
I find some members of my family really do pick and choose which parts of the bible to follow.
We are all the way here, in the United States of America, unaware of what is going on across the world.
When I thought of Afghanistan before this class it was just a place on a map that we've been at war with.
I believe forgiveness is not just a one time deal where you choose to forget what a particular person did and be okay with it for the rest of your days.
Overall, I would say it was an eye opening class that makes me really think about racial variation and immigration.
Especially since black people and other minority people are given less opportunities and treated unfairly, the topic of race will never die.
I used to admire Germany very much and think German is the best nation in the world.
That was the first time I heard about Afghan people in class.
With death threats hanging over his shoulder he still manages to fight for his people which is something I cant say I would be able to do.
To value one race over another is so ridiculous.
No one ever thinks about the numbers of not only American troops that are killed but the thousands of Afghanistan troops and innocent civilians that are bombed and murdered each year.
I know it is out of my control that business and self-interests are part of war, but I still believe that we should find a way help without turning the country into a war zone.
Most civilians are unaware of how our military is running and what is being instructed by troupe leaders.
LikeI just feel like theres such a weird clouded image we have of the middle east and theres never really been a medium or anything to truly show us what life is like over there.
That many innocent Afghani's lives are put in danger every day including Rafi's.
Sam brought up the point where it is almost more of who is more right than the other, which should not be the case.
I am glad that I was able to be better educated on the military and some of their training purposes.
This anger makes me glad that the United States unleashed hell on the Taliban.
The smiling soldier photo was nice.
The war in the Middle East doesn't just involve soldiers, its involving the lives of innocent civilians.
I could not imagine Rafis circumstances but am thankful for the chance to hear his story and see what he does to promote peace.
At the end it is all about survival and you will whatever you need to do to ensure you and your loved ones are safe.
And she also has plenty of stories to always tell me about Dubai and all the things that are expected of women that adds to this man dominated society.
God would rather us be happy especially if said partner was abusive.
Our country was built off of slavery and still isn't an equal playing ground today.
The stereotype that all soldiers are on the front lines just isnt true even when they are outside the fence it is rare for them to see contact.
I really liked the way Sam stated this, war isnt just this thing that is out there.
I lived in India for about 7 years and over there too I could distinguish between not only where a person came from, but to a certain extent, what religion and ethnicity they were.
By seeing differences in others can help stop racism at its root.
No one deals with family being separated well and no matter the religion, divorce is always such a sad topic and hard to cope with.
There was a map on the screen to locate where it was in the world but this exercise showed that it was more than a location.
He pointed out that, despite living in a war zone, Rafis daughters have dreams just like anyone else.
You raise a point about how upsetting it is that the culture maybe too welcoming for Americans, which I agree.
It really does make me question: What Bible are you reading?
I only hope that more people leave these stereotypes in the movies, tv shows, and news and instead try to learn about other people by experiencing it firsthand.
It showed to be detrimental to his job as well.
Like Rafi had discussed, simple dialogues and understanding the other person are key in propagating peace and ending war.
I was the one who does not see because of my lack of understanding about the situation.
If a soldier is able to do this, anyone else who is not in a stressful war type of situation should be able to follow.
When we see or know people who are impacted by these terrorist attacks in Boston or France or even on 9/11 it can be easy for us to generalize and direct our anger at entire groups of people that have no association with these terrorists.
Innocent people are effected by the war and no one seems to notice or care.
However, I always used to believe that being a part of the military meant that you would constantly fight for your country, and thus would have to do whatever necessary to defeat the opposition.
When thinking about it, I could not stand up for what I believed in, even without the consequences being real.
People need to accept that people are always going to have differing opinions and that tolerance is key.
From what I learned these are every day civilians just doing what they have to get by.
However, money does not have to stop you from learning about the world.
This man was able to find humor in such a dark time and used it to motivate his fellow troops.
I think our generation needs to be more aware of the damages being done with war considering we have grown up always knowing of war.
In reality, its not just soldiers dying.
I would like to respond to the Who Are the Afghan People clip.
Sam altered my thoughts when he showed a photo of something as simple as a traffic jam and said look, just like everywhere else.
We all should know why we are doing what we are doing.
During this class, I tried to put myself in the shoes of a person in Afghanistan.
War happening in Afghanistan is just some distant thing to us and either we do not understand it or do not care, so its easy to just forget about it.
By considering the real people that are on the other side of the United States actions we can help reduce this hate and try to take actions that dont damage these ordinary peoples lives.
I think that this is something that can be experienced more in the older generations.
The unique opportunity to listen and learn from Rafis story is something I will always be grateful for.
It is very easy to disregard bad things happening around the world when they arent directly affecting you.
The world needs to stop being shown as such a negative place because it is not as bad as it is portrayed to be.
Martin Luther King Jr., along with many others, wanted to change this, so they started the movement.
I agree with what you mentioned on your post, we tend to forget that Afghans are real people just like us.
I agree with this because it is very easy to forget what is happening half way across the world.
I think it does a disservice to them, and a disservice when it comes to being honest with ourselves.
South Indians have smaller noses though their skin color varies greatly.)
But, this huge value of Christianity seems too often to be forgotten and taken over by judgement.
As Sam said their are very similar books however they just have different prophets leading their people.
Not all people in the Middle East involved in the war are terrorists or trying to harm American soldiers.
Each dash represented different people dying, from civilians to military officials.
But there was no way in hell that I was coming here on my own growing up poor with drug abusing parents.
As someone who loves trying new foods, I think was great that his family is trying to incorporate the Afghan food into their cooking here.
Its hard to imagine that all this is worth people losing their lives for this.
I also agree that open conversation between Afghans and Americans is important.
I also felt inspired by his bravery and found myself reflecting on situations in my life where I should have stood up for what I believed it.
As soon as you hear personal stories and see real images of people from Afghanistan, your view on the war is instantly changed, even slightly.
For it only to be torn away from him, especially as tragic as it was, is nothing short of truly tragic.
If someone experiences biblically sinful emotions such as hate, they tend to justify those feelings through Holy Scriptures.
I agree with all of the points you made.
When there is a bomb in these streets, that are crowded to the thousands with people at one time, there is going to be a lot of civilians hurt.
And because of this fact, a lot is left up to interpretation.
In addition to that, I want to talk about why race became an issue in the past, which all starts with the case of racial tension in communities Ferguson and Missouri.
I do practice Christianity, but I used to be an atheist when I went into high school.
I had never truly seen what Afghanistan looked like only images of war torn cities or pictures of the desert or mountains.
It is really a complicated feeling when I saw the pictures of women's clothing style change.
Yeah I agree with your statement, Afghanistan is generalized as a country of violence and hatred solely because one awful group who is controlling the country.
The internet is a great example of what anonymity lets people do.
Years ago, change was a hard thing to accept for many people.
They only show the terror of what is going on and it puts the picture of this awful place that only revolves around war in peoples minds.
In todays media driven world, we are often given only glimpses of reality.
There may be a disconnect with the events of violence if we do not hear it from someone who experiences it first-hand, and it is crucial for everyone to stay educated with the affairs of our government with it comes to fighting in different countries.
If war is a business, I feel that at least the military personnel should be guided on the cultures of Afghanistan so incidentssuch as the shooting of the children who were doing a smoke cleansing would not have happened.
I was happy when Sam finally asked Rafi to talk about why he stays in Afghanistan and why he chooses to not have a bodyguard because I was highly curious and Rafis response did not disappoint.
On October 7th, 2001 the United States began a bombing campaign on Taliban controlled Afghanistan and then brought in ground troops to seize control of cities.
If the war was actually brought to the US too I think the majority of the US would be against the war.
If you spend your life in one area and never see what else is out there, then you will probably be more close minded than the rest of the world.
Jingxin, first of all I really enjoyed your response and I really relate to it.
Who do all of the things that we, as Americans, do.
I think you brought up a very good point about stereotypes.
I had a similar experience when I visited Israel.
It is affecting everyday civilians tragically and something needs to be done about it.
I believe Sams goal of this lecture was to open our eyes and try to change this from being the first thought that enters our mind.
Although, they were not there for the trip this helped them to get a better understanding of Jamaica.
It's thought provoking and It's cool to hear that you came from a class with only 130 students.
Then I showed them sams video and they kind of had the same reactions I have had and its just so interesting what we don't see or know.
Its hard to develop a sympathetic perspective on this war until we put a face to the strangers.
Also in that setting people often think that race is talked about too much.
In the video, Colonel Garey tells the class about how in Afghanistan, before discussing any business they all sit down and drink tea for about an hour, talking about their families and daily lives.
Innocent people are being killed because they think that they are being threatened or low-key getting other peoples' oil.
That I should not and cannot simply be complacent with the information that is presented to me in school.
Sure, we are catholic and are told to forgive, however we are also human and find it hard to forgive those who anger us.
This makes me question then, what it means to be an authentic Asian.
The American public needs to see that there are families that parallel our own living in a war zone.
It was really interesting to see what he was going to talk about.
Religion should not come in point because no good person wakes up one day wanting to kill in the name of god.
We use computers and high quality technological instruments to vote where these people are voting in a process that you would probably see back in the 1700s when the first presidents were elected.
By being diverse and learning about other cultures, we better ourselves as people and can better those around us.
He was a normal man, with a job, wife, and kids coming to talk about how Afghans are people just like us.
Without a doubt there are many violent, evil people living there but we don't realize that there are normal, happy families who live there as well.
This definitely was an eye-opening lecture and I'm glad that this discussion was brought up.
From my perspective as an American this war is justified and makes me glad to be part of a country that will descend upon anyone that attempts to bring pain and suffering into our country.
I think this anger is what leads to a lot of the hate and aggression towards Muslims and Middle Easterners that has been visible in recent years.
400 lives will never be the same.
It was alarming to hear from Rafi that some people in Afghanistan cannot see a future for themselves.
It saddens me to know that we are hurting innocent people everyday.
I agree with you that the number of mixed race couples will definitely continue to grow in the upcoming years.
Another photo that Lieutenant Colonel Garey showed during his talk was an Afghanistan patriot during a military operation smiling.
However, that doesn't mean that everything is just ok.
I believe that knowing the culture showed the civilians that they were there to help and that they care enough to learn the language and culture in order to help them.
I also learned about their perspectives on the US and the war, which I thought was really cool and eye-opening.
It makes me wonder why homosexuality was focused on so much out of all of those actions, and I have a feeling it might be due to homosexuality being the minority in comparison to heterosexuality.
I never knew that it said specifically who would and would not be going to heaven.
Honestly before this class I have never thought about the country.
However, my impression about this country has changed since Rick and Raffie gave their speeches in our class and since I watched the video about Afghanistan in Quiz 1 resources.
Notice my use of the word organized.
All I am getting at is that, we should not let religion dictate our morals and view of the world.
We don't want to see ourselves as aggressors in this situation but that might actually be the case.
These reasons are why it is so powerful that Dr. Richards actually brought in the guest speaker Mr. Rafi.
When he was explaining to us that most people have a twisted perception of Afghanistan as a constant warzone of hatred and fighting.
I then thought, how many other innocent people has our government accidentally hurt.
Through adaptations, Native Americans and South Americans developed other different traits for survival but in the end they still share physical features that are subtle enough to confuse one who has never examine different people closely enough to differentiate.
Just because some radical people do terrible things does not justify condemning an entire religion.
In lab this week, we compared what happened to Basim to the 911 attacks.
I learned from his photos that the Afghanistan voters after voting would dip their fingers into an ink well, similar to a I just voted!
In this specific video a student tweeted a question that asked What thing did you learn while in Afghanistan that shocked you the most?
When speaking to my grandparents about this topic they are very conservative and traditional in their thoughts.
Sadly, they are the ones who are being affected the most by these attacks.
This is the life we have, there's no changing that.
I couldnt agree with you more on this type of topic.
Because of prior reasons of some Afghanistan people, Americans categorized Afghans as all being terrorists and bad people.
Multiple countries are using their land as a battlefield to settle their disputes.
Therefore, when major issues such as divorce and homosexuality are left for people to understand on their own, discrepancies are inevitable.
The story about the young children waving the sage around military soldiers was very unfathomable to imagine.
I think that to maintain a dialogue we have to uphold racism for what it was historically, and not throw the word around and put it in terms of reverse racism.
Seeing people who did not fit the classic white ideal was a rarity in my hometown.
I began to do research on this thought because I knew I was extremely uninformed.
Rafis daughters are in the middle of a war zone, and he is forced to live a life around this war.
When I was younger I would attend church with my grandparents, but I never fully understood what we were talking about.
To me, this video was the most interesting because of how Sam puts everything with Afghanistan into perspective.
How could that be when in reality women are oppressed and forced by rule of the Taliban?
Truthfully, before this lecture, I don't think anyone realized the pain and suffering some innocent people go through during war.
I felt helpless because I do not know politics much and I do not understand the necessity of wars.
I was most struck by Rafis bravery.
Even within Christianity, it is a fight of different ways people interpret the Bible.
The Quran and the Bible echo many of the same ideas, with only really minor differences coming to the mainstream populations attention, thanks to biased media and government propaganda during the War on Terror.
Not to mention the separation of church and state that our founding fathers thought was a good idea, inevitably when you show preference to one group over another conflict will arise.
There are so many misconceptions and false notions revolving around the civilians and everyday people of the Middle East that makes it hard for Americans to believe they are all anything but radical.
We can take away from this story the importance of learning another persons culture in understanding their thoughts and actions as well as the importance of simple communication.
This trend is slowly changing but not nearly fast enough.
I think that an important lesson from Basim is that sometimes being hateful will only make the situation worse.
Honestly it sickness me that the United States fight wars at the expense of innocent Afghan people for over 30 years without any valid excuses why were they there in the first place.
That is an extremely aggressive preventative measure to continue taking but is it worth it?
Why are we allowed to get pissed when we're doing the same thing to other countries.
This is all to ensure the wellness of the children and the prosperity of the family.
I think it is very important to be able to connect with people across the world so we all can get a little more knowledgably, and less closed minded.
Lieutenant colonel Richard Garey deployed himself in Afghanistan with many of his troops knowing that there is a large chance of no survival.
Finally for me and my sister's take on the topic we are totally open with the idea of a mixed couple.
There is often a misconception about what the lives of both US soldiers and Afghan soldiers are like.
I find that this message would be much more powerful to show and influence individuals who are here in the US to have a better understanding of what is truly happening in foreign countries.
I agree with you completely on the fact that sports do not really involve race or the economic differences between them.
Everyone strives to be a good person, even with things like divorce.
In my opinion, this is a very interesting way to govern your people.
I think this is a very important lesson to learn.
He then asks the whole class if they are any one of the things written in the bible and every single person raised hishand, this only made Sam's point drill deeper into our minds.
Maybe its because we are too shy to initiate a conversation.
Something so complex as war is fought for many reasons and effects almost every person living in the country.
I have never heard or even seen anything like it, so I am interested in trying it.
Psychologically speaking, people are much less likely to harm people that they feel a personal connection to.
When discussing war, I agree that it is a concept many Americans and some others cannot grasp.
Caroline, I found response very interesting and I completely see where you are coming from.
Soldiers should expect to get much help from people when they're speaking a language that the citizens don't understand.
I assume I didnt really think about the consequences that war brings to these people who do not really want a war.
They do not want the war and I am pretty sure that no one anywhere would like to see in their homelands what is happening in the Middle East right now.
Sam Richards said that you cannot stay in an angry dark place because it ultimately destroys you.
I never really had an image in my head that there are people just trying to live a normal life while they are surrounded by war.
the numbers of civilians and officers that have been killed and are being killed every year continues to add up.
There is a very small likelihood of that happening in America.
Getting to hear Rafi talk in class and seeing his innocent daughters was an eye opener and certainly has at least some of the students of soc 119 thinking a little more about the war in Afghanistan.
Also, the media does play a huge role in this.
Sure people may get jealous of the way others look because they think this other person is better looking.
You wrote a very compelling response and I identified with many of the statements you made.
I agree that this is the first step to making America a more comfortable space.
All the religions have the same essence, being a good person.
In my life, there have been things that I have felt strongly about.
For some reason Ive always been interested in the war.
When young black men were shot and killed by white police officers and trigger intense social commentary, but the government hasnt figured out a solution for those cases.
Yet they believe that their sin does not count because they feel they can choose which sin is worse.
In American, the media depicts Afghanistan as a poor, rundown country where all Afghans live in poverty and hopelessness.
Most people wonder why African Americans are dark, but that relates back to their ancestors as well.
There are people in America who want no part in war.
Forgiveness to me is something that is beyond us as humans.
You do not see a lot of newspapers publishing stories about the families who have to live through the war circumstances.
Individuals who want nothing to do with it and who are scared to leave their homes.
The Lieutenant Colonel explained to the class that it is not constant fighting, and that he was often times engaging in politics with the people of the opposing country whether they be civilians or military leaders.
We were showed images and told stories of the terrorist groups that have taken over the country.
The media has implanted the idea in American citizens minds that all Muslims and people from the Middle East are bad people which could not be further from the truth.
We have these expectations and thoughts, but what was the reality.
I used to think of it as just unnecessary and a means for people to fight for power and expand their greed.
To make the claim that not talking about race will defuse the issue of racism in America proves just that.
I think I also assumed that it would be more strict and unfavorable to women.
Its a point of view that was truthful and honest, in which compares the expectations vs. the reality of who the the Afghan People are.
Christians would still not vote for a pro lgbt bill if they thought it went against their religion, as people use religion to base how they feel about certain things, whether it be correct or not.
I wonder how I would live every day if another countrys military walked my home town streets and frightened me with war.
A lot of these same people have only ever read the Bible (or other equivalent religious text) a couple times, if at all.
I think it is really important for more students in the United States to have opportunities like this because it is really eye opening and shows the actual costs of the war.
I agree that this class was extremely valuable.
We saw traffic jams, much like the ones I sit in when I want to travel into New York City.
I didn't really think about civilians being attacked either, and I wish we could do something.
Is that what we are protecting ourselves from?
Just like Christianity, Islam is a religion with a set of beliefs and rules to live by in the Quran.
While there is so much debate about gay marriage and gay rights in the United States, it is shocking that all of these other unrighteous acts are largely ignored and not debated.
Rather I believe that they are using religion, God, and the bible as an excuse for their hatred.
It was something that I knew was going on, but I never really understood the extent of it.
I think his experience shows how powerful forgiveness can be.
By using the New Testament to govern our people, there would probably be much debate.
I guess I just don't understand why many christians I know bash and judge others for sinning when bashing and judging others is a sin in itself.
It is really unfair and I feel bad for them.
I think that we should take a step back and reassess ourselves as humans.
Traveling does change the world at a subjective interpersonal level.
Why should we pretend that it is?
It also devastating to see that people of Afghanistan lost their lives due to cultural misunderstandings.
They fail to mention the casualties of innocent civilians, and the fact that we have invaded someone elses home.
can't overlap wars in general.
The one that stuck out the most to me was Tuesdays class with Mr. Basim Razzo.
White people were actually using Indians and indentured servants as slaves in the beginning, but after they saw how strong and nave Africans were, Europeans decided to make them their new slaves instead.
We really are blinded by privilege and dont realize these things in life.
That is originally what I thought before hearing what LTC Garey had to say.
Rafi lives in fear because he receives death threats from the Taliban for his work.
This lecture reinforced the idea that everyone has a different way of interpreting and responding to text.
Why didn't we just take Iraq's oil or claim Iraq and Afghanistan as our own?
It was hard for me to grasp this until this lecture, I think that Sam did a really good job of providing real life images of Afghan society like Rafis family, the traffic jams and the Kabul city shopping center that make this more real for people on the other side of the war.
While the Bible does not accept homosexuals, people ignore many of the other things that the Bible states are sins.
No one should be coerced into religiously following the word of the Bible if that is not what they believe in.
I personally cannot relate to the feeling of living in fear at all.
They are easily convinced by prejudice voices and ignore truth and reality.
I grew up with Chinese neighbors down the street and they are practically my second family.
Bassim's story is just one of them, I'm sure there are many others, and to me that is just unacceptable.
For me personally, I have only traveled outside of the United States once.
We can see how these two sides conflicting will turn out when we look towards ISIS and the Middle East.
Being a (white) woman from the suburbs of New York, I grew up with a very biased perception of Muslim people.
He has already lost his best friend, whom he had to see a picture of on the screen of in remembrance.
I even find it difficult to read the New Testament because sometimes the stories seem hard to relate to situations in your life.
With that being said I also agree with what you said about going with whoever side has the most power.
Another case is when a mentally unbalance young white man sits quietly and killed nine black parishioners which eventually triggered black peoples emotion.
I always remember people saying that the United States had a separation of church and state, but I never really knew that there was an actual clause in the constitution that made it mandatory for there to be separation, yet there is a reason I put mandatory in quotes.
All the rest is interpretation, and its important to keep a specific line for these otherwise it is hypocritical.
Religion becoming law would never work without an establishment like ISIS forcing people to follow it.
This trip really opened my eyes to different types of people and different living conditions that I did not truly anticipate.
It's easy to look at other countries see their flaws and believe that there is no way were similar to them at all.
That's not what Islam is all about.
I grew up going to Catholic school and I did not like it at all.
Different people have different cultures and ways of life, therefore, its important to not make assumptions or judgements beforehand.
He described the people as very generous and it made it all seem very real to me.
Therefore, the Christians killing for their God are not seen as Christians in my eyes.
I think a lot of us are blind to war for the fact that it does not affect us, as it affects others.
Is marrying another women not violating that same rule?
Although what happened to him two years ago- life goes on and it is important for everyone to realize that.
When we see images of families, we realize that they arent that different from us.
Viewing pictures online or reading articles about different places around the world is very different than actually emerging yourself in their culture.
When the Lieutenant said that the people from Afghanistan were welcoming and invited him into their homes for tea, I was just as shocked as you and many of our peers were.
As a younger student of religion, my parents always harped on me to read the Bible.
I really enjoyed hearing about your take on war affecting real people.
This is one of the causes of the ignorance that has led our country to be so full of hatred for different groups of people.
I also think that there is a misconception when it comes to the people living in Afghanistan.
Also, there are many figures throughout the bible who committed some horrendous sins but then were converted to Christianity and forgiven by god.
On the contrary, they make Islam sound ugly and horrible which diminishes all of our hard work as Muslims to show other people around the world that Islam is a peaceful religion and it was never about oppressing women not violence.
To put yourself in their shoes and to think about what it would be like to have to live in constant fear is very eye opening.
This has been one of the longest running wars in history, and it is not over yet.
The statute must not increase government entanglement with religion.
With so many people having phones, communication with other people around the world has never been easier.
Since it is rarer than not to have connections like the one Sam has with Rafi, I think it should be up to the media and our government to show US citizens what is really happening in places such as Afghanistan.
I thought this video was really interesting as well, because being in America, we don't really learn about the people living in the war zones.
He showed us the Kabul city shopping center, a mall that resembles the ones that I frequent here in the United States.
Seeing a fraction of the real life in Afghanistan, made me think about my own life.
The way that he explained his experiences and reasoning behind the things that the military do really changed my view.
Terrorism never and ever come from a religion, it comes from selfish people who think that the whole world should be as they see and prefer.
Innocent people on both sides of the war die, so even though this war is happening on the other side of the world, our soldiers are dying too.
When Rafi spoke on the war in Afghanistan, I gained a plethora of knowledge on the topic and completely changed my base outlook on war.
Something we mentioned that was not mentioned in class was getting divorced because you fell out of love with your spouse.
I went back to Christianity when there was problems in my family and I started praying to solve them.
The number of Afghans being killed keeps going up and up.
It is more of just a guide on how to be a good person.
I have always had lots of comforts that I never really thought of as privileges.
He also looked at gay people and said sorry you're just not getting in.
Everyone has different experiences that make them see the Bible in different lights, and even the smallest details can be interpreted differently.
However from Basims perspective what happened to his family is a lot like what allegedly brought America into Afghanistan.
With all the violence you would think there was a way to help without turning all of Afghanistan into a war zone.
In class I learned about all of the types of people who would not make it to the golden gates.
While I think using the Bible or whatever religious text you choose is valuable to guide your own life, there arises a lot more issues when one tries to generalize it to an entire society, especially one that is not homogenous in its religious preference.
This guy in the photo is smiling and seems to be joking with the rest of his fellow soldiers.
LTC Garey could get away with it because he had the rank and pull to do that sort of thing.
I grew upfortunate and spent many years traveling different countries, but when I revisited them, common stereotypes about those countries had certainly corrupted me.
I believe too often we look at soldiers who just want to go overseas to fight and kill people.
That to me is just so inspiring and the epitome of one man making a difference.
The war is affecting not just those in the United States, but also the others on the other side of the hatred.
If American people read the Quran or just listened to Afghan people like Rafi, they would learn that there are similarities between religions.
It's necessary for us to travel and if we can't do that research and really learn about other countries in the world.
It is unfair to think one way about something just because someone told you it is true.
Real individuals from Afghanistan who solely work for peace, get murdered for doing the right thing.
I agree with what you said about people interpreting the Bible in different ways.
Sam then makes a joke or two about sodomy to lighten the tension in class.
Actually it happened that two bombs were in my neighborhood.
In my opinion, Islam and Christianity are opposite sides of a coin, although made from the same material but still worlds apart.
Although they are both tragic, it is really hard to compare the two because they are on totally different scales.
However, this portion of your response makes me realize how differently we value information as people, which truly is fascinating to me.
Americans could be contributing to the fear the civilians feel and the hostile environment that they have grown up and live in.
The war has been there for too long and people are not even aware of the cause of this war and the global interests involved in it.
It was interesting to see the pictures of different malls, cities, and Rafi's house.
And later, we learn to use the language we obtained from our living environment to meet and communicate with people out there in the world.
After the lesson from Rafi, I really think that we should challenge ourselves in daily lives to form conversation with people you know and you may not know.
Seeing his face and being able to communicate with him over Skype was even more eye opening.
They do not know how good life can be because they live in such a horrific environment.
Dialogue has always played an important role in our life.
Those stereotypes assign better or lesser images regarding different races, and tensions between the better and the lesser lead to discrimination.
Rafi says if he or his brother or his neighbor or sister stops fighting then who will continue to fight for peace in Afghanistan?
Of course, the western countries allies, who are more moderate, should and it was demonstrated by Lt Garvey,  take military actions trying to respect the Afghan culture and protecting real people.
I could not agree more with what you said.
Hearing about the bombing of Bazims house was both disgusting and alarming.
I see the light in which Sam tried to discuss this but the overall assumption about their culture still shines brighter if you ask me.
We work hard to provide for our families, no matter which country you are living in.
Its quite hard to classify him as European since he looked Asian, but many deemed him European because one may argue that he is European since Kazakhstan is considered by people to be a European country- which is quite intriguing because only ten percent of Kazakhstan is in Europe and the rest belongs in Asia.
I did not know that there was more to that quote.
You have to choose it every single day.
As Americans, we should be ever vigilant of when our rights are being violated, and not be lulled into a false sense of security by religions that media attempts to paint as docile.
War is a business in which the main factor is false news.
You said that you found it interesting that American are physically similar to Asians but they differ in traditions.
When he read the rest, I was shocked.
Forgiveness is the key that unlocks the door to move forward.
Its not a coincidence that stories like Bassims were not present in mainstream media.
Afghan people are in the crossfire, not because there is something at stake for them, but because we do not care about their lives.
Many people in American only know Afghanistan from movies and what they see on tv and social media.
From my experience, everyone is extremely welcoming at meetings, festivals and cultural nights, especially if you are an outsider to the culture.
Of course the initial logical idea would be to pull the troops out, but would you run the risk of another ISIS happening in another country?
This soldier used to think what people and the media had said about Afghanistan and Muslims.
War impacts everyone differently, and I personally do not agree with our governments desire for constant war and their lack of comprehension of its affects on the American people.
He proceeded to tell us that forgiveness was a crucial aspect of life and without one would be mad forever and be unable to move on in life.
There is a lot of light to be shed on the actual people living there that are so generous.
However, she knew that the Bible didnt have all the answers, which she questioned a lot.
He explained that there was a bombing at the mall before going on to show us photos of his friend Rafi and his daughters.
The response seemed less than accurate and a little bit insulting to civilians.
It is nearly impossible to follow every law in the Quran and New Testament, or for at least me it seems that way.
It i interesting learning about afghanistan and their culture because they are normal people like us but because of a certain group, they are hated upon and they are treated badly.
However, I think it is also important to show the civilians who are truly being affected by this war.
It was used as a moral guide to help lawmakers determine what is the difference between right and wrong.
I was raised to love and appreciate everyone I meet if they treat me with the same level of respect.
Its interesting to see how easy or emotion-based divorces are in pop-culture, movies, and everyday life.
What many of those people, especially white, dont understand is that avoiding the conversations about race only makes their lives better.
Rafi has two little girls living in this warzone that is perpetuated by America.
That is certainly not something that I would expect to see from someone who is moments away from an incredibly intense and dangerous situation.
We just want to push the blame.
He made me ask myself what drives me, and I had the same answer as him.
I will admit that I have never read the Bible, nor do I claim the faith of Christianity.
Does this ability to divorce earlier in Afghanistan mean that women have more freedom there?
This discussion served as a reminder of just how lucky I am to live the life I do.
We are constantly forgetting that Afghanistan is a real place with real civilians, just like us.
America is portrayed to be the freest land in all of Earth but we came to learn that there are some ideas that contradict that thought.
Over the next weeks or so I observed her, and realized that I could kind of see how her ancestry made her the way she was.
How could someone take religion, something with extremely non violent ideals, and turn these words into volatile acts?
I have not read the whole bible, but I do believe that divorce is mentioned as being a sin several times.
They come to learn that they are also just people but living and trying to survive in a war zone.
It's always hard to understand why dialogues, negotiating etc.
I do not think Sam was correct in his teachings of if you practice any sins that youre not going to Heaven because the Bible does mention several times how those who repent and ask for forgiveness will be able to go to Heaven.
I completely agree that race will also be discussed in the United States because it is embedded in our society.
If everyone in the world has his mentality/ outlook on life, I believe the world would most certainly be a better place.
Ahmadrafi also shows the world what the Islam teaches.
It causes them to easily be corrupted just because they believe the idea of a pure, protected life exist for everyone.
It is very interesting the differences between divorce in the muslim religion and what we are used to seeing here in America.
Education is the first step to fixing this problem.
The Taliban as well as our American troops have taken over what they used to know as their towns, homes, community areas, etc.
How long until our freedom of speech and right to a fair trial by jury is violated?
Razzo said that after the bombing he was numb, then he was angry, and after several months he started to forgive.
The word racism itself has gotten mixed up with other adjectives that assist in defining racism, but do not fully define it, like bigotry, prejudice, or ignorance.
I agree with what you said about having a biased perception of Muslim people.
We are putting ordinary peoples lives in danger and we need to consider what our actions will mean for them and their families.
It is a shame but it is the honest truth.
The Bible said nowhere to kill innocent black people, however thats how he perceived from what he thought he read in the bible.
Hence, somewhere along the line, more melanin was added to their skin to protect them from too much sun.
It is unbelievable that we, as a military, still are stationing ourselves in Afghanistan.
At the end of the day, I hope that people will become more aware of living communities outside of our own.
It was also intriguing to learn the perspective of the civilians in Afghanistan from that story.
When the little kids were blessing the soldiers, as a practice of their religion, the soldiers shot and killed them because they were unaware of what the boys were doing.
Race is also highlighted in sports and political systems, so I agree that race will always be a topic in the United States.
People deserve the right to choose how they want to live their life.
I grew up in a very white area outside of Philly, and I too had never been exposed to their culture.
The thing that struck me that Sam said was war isnt just this thing thats out there.
Afghanistan is a very busy country and many of the photos that Sam projected were of busy streets and nice malls that look similar to ones we have been in.
This broke my heart completely and changed the way I think about Afghanistan.
When I went back inside to tell someone about the incident, they informed me that he was simply a police officer.
However, if they opened their eyes, they would see that they are wrong, our religions are similar, and there is no need for the extreme hate or violence.
I was aware of this ugly truth as Im sure most of you were, but I think it is always important to hear about it first hand and be reminded of it in order to provoke change.
25,000 Ukrainians per day were dying and no one was speaking about it.
He is a man who wanted nothing else other than for him and his family to be happy, and to work his whole life to get to that achievement.
I completely agree with what you said, George.
You will hear a lot of people make statements about wanting the world to just get along.
We have to understand that it was a group trying to antagonize the United States not an entire country.
I liked how Sam brought all aspects into this lecture by showing both sides of the war.
If a foreign country came in and accidentally bombed my house and killed my love ones, I do not know if I would be able to have the same strength that Basim exemplified.
The media is most people only window into what is happening around the world.
So the students who wish to speak or share their opinion can just easily log onto their phones and type what they wish to speak.
I found this lecture on war in the middle east to be one of the more interesting thus far.
Affirmative action is used to give minority students a better chance at receiving an education and helps to increase diversity of students at a university.
I think that military personnel should be more informed about where they are going.
And as you mentioned, the often portray a skewed version of reality.
He was making the best of his situation and cherishing every bit of it.
I was really glad to hear him bring this up and explain to others because I think this is something that is often misunderstood.
I like how you ended with What the world should be doing is restoring dignity and stability to Afghanistan and helping them to rebuild their society to what it once was.
I agree with you that gaining knowledge in other religions would completely change the way people with different beliefs interact with each other.
I cannot even imagine living in fear my entire life.
The media in our country does a great job of making it look like we are only fighting bad people whenever we go to war.
I definitely think more students need to take part in conversations like these so that we can rid ourselves of preconceived notions and have a better understanding of the people in the world around us.
Do you say you are authentic because you grew up in Asia?
We often see just numbers and charts of casualties but we forget that the death of 1 person affects everyone around them .
Negotiations and talking will help the US troops understand exactly what they are dealing with, and that its not simply bad guys vs. good guys.
As I got older I stopped going to church, and started recognizing the science behind earth's creation and why things happen.
I believe it is so important to travel the world, and become exposed to different cultures.
When he first showed the picture of Rafi, I wasnt expecting to see him standing in front of the class a few minutes later.
War is messy, innocent lives will be lost.
I myself had a specific image of Afghanistan in my mind from watching the news and only seeing one angle.
Most Americans know about ISIS and the threats that they pose, but due to their reign, many other important factors are being overlooked.
we were told not to eat anything that was offered by the locals.
Nicole, I really enjoyed reading your post and completely agree with your opinion on this topic.
But if this is the criteria for being authentic, then what about American-Asians?
The world is not as negative a place that it is portrayed to be and people from seemingly different cultures are more similar than perceived.
However, we are oblivious that it is going on in our own country with Christianity.
The way he compares the similarities between Islam and Christianity really astounded me.
How could we expect this to stop if nothing is being done to inform the young people of their and their parents despicable acts?
It is also limited, and I should treat it as a resource to understand the basis of certain issues, so that I can further my knowledge about them through my own investigation.
I have often jumped to the conclusion that the Afghan people are different, that they could not possibly be like us.
This did baffle me because I do often associate christian beliefs with republicans so I never really would question if someone said that.
I feel like you last comment I am utterly terrified is one of the most important responses to the beginning of sharia christianity in the United States, as that is what many of the people looking to form this Sharia Christianity United States feel about sharia law in the middle east.
For us, the war has defined Afghanistan.
I thought this question was great because I believe people in America don't really know whats going on in Afghanistan or the Middle East in general.
When Rich said that it was their form of polling process I was actually taken back because the process is so different in the US.
Later, when you said that you were not sure what the point the Lieutenant was trying to get across, I think you hit it spot on.
This was evident by the story told by the US officer.
And obviously it is not always up to the man to decide.
Simply hearing about Rafi Nadiri and his two daughters and wife made the people on the other side of the war so real.
I think a lot of people, me included, should get more involved in being aware of why our country does what it does especially when it involves the lives of so many Afghans and Americans.
The image displayed in Israel is that all Muslims are unfriendly and they hate all Jews, which I am.
My dad was a cop for 25 years and was constantly watching the military channel and forcing me to watch war movies with him.
It is the way they have adapted to where they live and such and I think the world will soon adapt to having more people of color.
Another change the American government may need to change is informing soldiers about the culture of the war zone they are entering.
For many of us, the idea of war is what we see in our minds.
That perception affects the way the American public views Afghanistan.
Rafi put his what drives you response into perspective for me.
In a sense, you have to blame the person not the religionif a person does wrong in response to following their law.
Just through knowing of my girlfriend's relationship with her husband I can see what people are talking about when they say man dominate a lot.
After this class I found out that in Afghanistan women could get divorced after four years if her husband goes missing.
On top of just being judged by others, these people face bombings, fear for their life and the fact that the movies display the country as a desert is what changes the perception.
Ukraine had a similar holocaust when Russia created a massive genocide of Ukrainians.
Also, what does it mean to be American in terms of race?
There are two parts of racism, prejudice, and discrimination.
It acts as our moral guide in everyday life, helping us to live our lives in the best way possible.
If we understand what that are going through, maybe we can be better informed about the war.
However, I have not done anything about it.
Ive been thinking about the role the US plays in Afghanistan.
We don't realize how often christian beliefs and ideals are truly pushed in our society unless were take a step back to really realize it.
Their kindness make the war looks even brutal.
A girl came up to me one day and told me that many thought she was Indian but she was not.
It is incredibly important to understand the history and ideologies of other people in order to fully comprehend complicated situations, such as the one going on in the Middle East.
The way he spoke about the people of Afghanistan is the best I've ever heard anyone talk about them and that's truly sad.
The life of a solider is accurately depicted in this part of lecture.
I never thought about it this way and I think it makes a lot more sense.
It is surprising to know that most Afghan people are still kind and generous to Americans.
I can't imagine everyday living in such fear.
I agree with you and one of your points that really stuck out to me was how while you're glad that we live in this protected country it's hard and uncomfortable knowing that it comes at a cost.
I am not defending the other side of a war by any means, but it struck me during class that even military personnel can have a false pretense of the other side in a war.
People think that the Bible should be taken literally because it is Gods word and we should do what it says.
I agree that it helped to hear his perspective as someone who spent so much time in Afghanistan and interacted with so many people there.
At least for now hopefully Sam opened our eyes and as the future of this country we can be a change and do more good than harm.
Another point I'd like to highlight is that it certainly feels weird thatLTC Garey had to teach the class that Afghan people are like American people.
We may not feel the immediate effects of a partisan, conservative Supreme Court today, but it will have lasting effects on our country.
With this in mind, I wonder, is there a better way to raise the awareness of individuals in the US?
Now, 8 or so years later the Bible has been read and I now consider myself an Agnostic.
The children in Afghanistan are born into a war.
If we set religion aside and really look at people as equals, then we should know that treating people fairly and loving one another is a step in the right direction.
I definitely encourage to anyone that is reading this to embrace on a journey of exploration somewhere different.
He showed us things we see in everyday life.
I always wanted to come here to Penn State ever since I was a child.
It was really assuring to see that people like Rafi go through their lives normally and have great families in Afrghan.
As with LTC Garey, his cultural ignorance prevented him from being able to complete his mission.
I completely agree, and I actually wrote about the same concept from the same lecture!
The media also must change; they need to show the good parts of Afghanistan, not just the poor areas and the bombed areas.
It is much more difficult to hate on a group of people that we feel like we understand.
The Army/VA helped make that happen and for that, I am eternally grateful.
In short, I am very glad we had this talk, it was informative I only wish it went into more detail and less blanket statements.
And most of people tend to believe what the media say about other country or nation.
I thought this was effective because we all have heard about Afghanistan but dont necessarily know what we associate the word and place with.
He made it seem very generous and warm.
This miscommunication could have easily been avoided if the soldiers were aware of their cultural practices and religious beliefs, but instead, this encounter ended in the deaths of a bunch of children.
No one is better than another just by the way they look.
Seeing the places that Afghans frequent showed me that their lives are so similar to mine, they go through the same routines as I do.
I especially see this in the heavy amount of racism that occurs in my town.
SomeAmericans dont experience desensitization in the same way, but instead have this idea that all Afghans hate America, are Taliban sympathizers, or areinvolved in fighting the war in some way or another.
This is the same in many thousands of soldiers that are in many other countries around the world.
Hearing my friends talk about how much they missed their homes made me wonder if it really was all bad.
Regardless, it might be surprising how similar the organizational structure of both has become.
It also made me wonder why we never see this side of Afghanistan?
However, as Sam pointed out there are Christians who interpret the Bible differently than I do.
I agree with you that money is a constraint to traveling the world and at times Sam talks about his trips as if everyone has the ability to just travel often.
Exploring the foods in a different culture is an amazing way to learn about it.
It's more subtle, but still exists.
African American history classes or history classes are put in place to educate students about racial issues and conflicts over cultural differences.
I knew that Sharia was associated with the Islam religion.
I see this happening all over my town especially in their political views.
However, there are people who arent changing and not are not becoming more progressive.
The Afghan security forces commander captured the man and Colonel Geary went to visit the command posts as a part of his rounds for the Afghan security forces to talk to the suspected commander.
However, this degree of personal hospitality does not seem as apparent.
The few extremists are the ones causing the hate yet blame it on entire groups and expect everyone practicing said religion to be just as extreme.
I think this lecture opened up the minds of many students and enabled you to see different perspectives.
The war in Afghanistan has been going on for nearly 16 years, and for most of us in this class, this is close to our whole lives.
People already understand there are hundreds and thousands of various races in the world.
They want to enforce their horrible views and need something to justify it.
They know he will inter the mosque and bomb himself and kill all the people.
I also agree with you on another point, personally, after seeing Mr. Rafis family photos and Mr. Rafi in person made me have actual feelings towards the people in Afghanistan.
I then took this question a step further and began to ask myself, why is Christianity in general, so right and all other religions are so wrong.
It surprised me when a complete stranger invited LTC Garey in their home for tea.
I feel like so many people want the American dream, and because of this I believe America is just superior in so many peoples eyes.
But through Rich sharing his experiences, it was the exact opposite.
What surprised me most was when Raffi spoke about the soldiers coming into the city and meeting the young boys with incense.
These children have no way of knowing anything different, as Rafi said, they were cut off from the internet, which is essentially their only way to gain knowledge of their unknown.
I can only give my evaluation to a country or a nation as I really learn how this country or nation is.
I think that the opportunity to talk with Rafi helped to show all of us the seriousness of what is happening.
When I think of Afghanistan, I have no clear image in my head whatsoever, a few words like War, Middle East popped up in my head.
I know most people wouldnt and thats just the American culture especially on the east coast.
Communication and trust with those in the country you are stationed in can drastically help acquire information.
In high school I had a great opportunity to be part of the Model UN team in my school.
Further more, in classrooms throughout the country, young students are constantly being taught about racial issues of the past and automatically have the idea installed in their head that the nation was built off these issues and that they still currently exist.
So a group of Christians interpret the same line in the Bible in many different ways and apply it to their life in different ways.
Islam shouldnt be portrayed as a religion that diminishes woman.
This experiences completely changed my life for better.
He believes they are some of the most warm and welcoming people he has encountered and would open their doors to strangers and lend their hospitality to them.
It made me a little sad when he compared the Afghans to Americans and said how most Americans would never go out of their way to invite strangers into their homes for tea.
He does not care about his personal security or the death threats that he is getting because he believes what he is doing right.
Other Christians interpret the bible different and believe in peace and praying.
I think it helps people who are religious find some sort of appreciation of this other culture that most people perceive as bad or evil.
Thousands are civilians trying to live their lives normally while their lives are in the center of war.
I agree that you will not understand how it is to live in a place like Jamaica if you go and stay in a resort that is set up to mimic the American life in order to attract more people.
I agree completely that is important to learn more about other cultures.
Friends, family they are all affected by war.
Without forgiveness, many people would continue to live an angry life, which does nothing but hinder that individual and the people around them.
This war has gotten to the point where just not much is being done to benefit anyone but instead it is harming civilians and soldiers on all sides.
Being able to see the effects of war on both sides of the war was very eye opening.
Even amongst my own family there are many differing ideologies and to propose one to be strictly better than another would start quite an argument and conflict, have a central governing figure do that, and the repercussions could be drastic.
However, we could not make sure if the resource of the information on main stream media is believable or not.
I was talking about in my own response how I feel extremely disconnected and uneducated about the war in Afghanistan.
The topic of the lecture I have chosen to write about was War Affects Real People.
It truly sickens me hearing about accidental bombings on civilians houses, and the lack of news on the fact that it was a civilian's house, rather it is played off as just another bombing in defense of our country.
Many people pick and choose certain parts of the text and decide how they want to interpret it then push it onto other people.
When I did go to church all that was ever reiterated was how forgiving, loving, and sacrificing Jesus is.
We have had such high tensions with Afghanistan for so long, that we are taught to hate the country.
No one wanted to talk about it and to this day a lot of people do not know of it.
Society looks at the Islamic religion and they think that they're people are radical and oppressed and forced to live by the rules of the Quran, which obviously is not the case.
He showed me a video of Iran so I could see how beautiful it was.
I did not realize how many things were considered sins, and how even when they are conducted in a minor way, they could inhibit you from reaching heaven.
I think it takes time.
The fact that he has an entire family at home and still puts his life on the line to make a difference for his country is amazing.
I think it is hugely commendable that he continues doing what he does despite the threat.
As people we love to put our voice out their.
I cant help to feel sad when Rich mentioned how most citizens dont want to be at war, they would just like to be at peace.
When you see the way people look differently from each other around this area, you can't help but wonder how appearance can be so different when were all the same internally.
People being classified for certain sports based on their race or ethnicity is questionable because I believe that anyone is qualified and capable of playing a sport if they have intentions to succeed.
This specific lecture was an amazing opportunity that I will definitely never forget.
I feel like not a lot of people are educated on the affect that the war has on civilians.
Everyone should try to see every individual as who they are no matter what they may have heard from other people.
Many white people do not enjoy having discussions about race because one way or another, it will tie back to white people in a negative way.
Many of the killings were a result of strict bible interpretation, and I found this to be extremely interesting, yet confusing.
His perceived idea of the Afghan people was somehow brought upon him here in the United States just like every other person here.
I think this helps people not only gather where others might come from but you will also notice that these people are most likely interracial.
I am still not very educated on every culture, but I think that my view has changed.
Fornicators, Idolaters, adulterers, sodomites, thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers, and extortioners are all regarded on the same unrighteous level as homosexuals according to this passage, yet the U.S. government has never had a say in whether or not oral sex, for example, is legal.
I chose the video What Drives You to Do What You Do?
After our conversations about the middle east, I believe we all owe it to ourselves to enhance our education on the topic.
Therefore, to hear LTC Garey express the exact opposite in his experiences was the refreshing take I was looking for.
After being this prolific in identifying peoples origins, I came to Penn State and thought it would be just the same.
This means that a lot of things are subjective, and therefore very greatly from person to person.
It was interesting how Sam brought up how different people interpret the Bible.
He shared that he lives his life under constant threat and often fears for his life.
Furthermore, although I can already tell that soc119 is an eye-opening course containing life changing material.
I feel like I never really thought of things this way and Sam gave me a new outlook on religion and beliefs across cultures and countries.
The race who lived on this country first are barely around now.
I think with 911, US military did not fully think about our actions when we went into Afghanistan because instead of just ridding of the enemy, we ended up killing and bombing hundreds of innocent civilians including Basims home and family.
Yes, a great deal of soldiers see combat but there are also a portion who have different roles and experiences.
When we hear the word Afghanistan, our mind definitely jumps to negative perceptions about the country.
He has a family at stake including two young daughters.
I think that lack of cultural understanding has caused there to be so much conflict between the US and other nations.
We don't know anything else unless we look for it.
I always hear people say terrible things about Afghanistan.
Its truly scary and horrifying to think about.
I think family is the strongest part of anyones life, coming from a very supportive and loving one.
I really appreciate what Rafi, LTC Garey, and Dr. Richards did by showing us the other side of war.
Or, Are we using the excuse of solidarity just to benefit those who play with our minds with the only purpose of fulfilling the desires of their pockets?
When LTC Garey said he thought the old man offering him tea was trying to kill him that hit home to me.
I thought that was interesting because, whether we choose to admit it or not, many of our laws come from the Bible.
Afghanistan has traffic jams and malls, along with everything we have here.
As Sam said, they have the same hopes and dreams as us.
I agree with your stance on 9/11 is correct in the fact that it has caused many people to create stereotypes in their minds.
I find it astonishing how we dont treat all the terror attacks the same because they are done for one purpose: to impose fear.
It is like Sam said, men and women are fighting for the freedom of people they hardly even know.
Keeping church and state separate is essential to the success of a nation.
By understanding each other, we could eventually work together to solve issues that arise.
I guess that just goes to show that people have confirmation bias towards their own beliefs and that it is easy to scapegoat the problem than to sit down and dig deeper.
Before that, I have always been neutral since I was in the unknown.
In reality, most wars happen due to the fact that groups of people have different ideas and morals.
Because of this, however, he is targeted by bad people and has received many death threats for this.
Sam even said that this story was not reported on in any US media outlet and that there are hundreds of more stories like his.
He said it really took him aback.
Society seems to put war in a corner and only shed light on what we want to see.
As a result, the information that makes Americans look bad will usually be voided from the broadcast and thus us Americans will never know about a 9 year old girl who died in an American bombing or a bus of innocent civilians getting hit.
In light of this, I was inspired to extend my understanding on certain issues and also understood that it is my responsibility to do so.
I think it was also very interesting to hear how LTC Garey talked about the people of Afghanistan and clearly was trying to understand what life was really like for them.
They are there to find information and protect people.
I think many people view all people from their as violent killers, but in reality, they are not.
With new modern discoveries and inventions, younger generations are more freethinking and willing to accept change.
Indeed, Afghanistan is not a wealthy country and it is still in tension right now.
I think sometimes war is a scary word that scares people off.
I believe that Islam takes good care of women, but people perceive Islam in a wrong way, also extremists are not doing any good.
The news did an okay job of covering the war when it first started, but now I feel like there is less and less coverage of what is actually happening over there.
Today, we aren't learning about the war.
It all comes back to them picking and choosing which part of the bible they want to follow.
I think that it is just so crazy how there are people out there that want to make this country a Christian nation, and that completely contradicts the Establishment Clause and the way the Founding Fathers wanted this country to be set up.
Whether we did so consciously or not, Islamophobia existed and was, somewhat, hyped up by the media.
Its hard to really put these numbers into perspective for a war thats happening halfway around the globe that we only see through mainstream media.
When he said this, it really hit me how bad things are in Afghanistan.
What Mr. Samiudin Rahin were doing in promoting peace and helping afghan women was astonishing.
The human nature of wanting to be right drives people to levels of hatred and biasness that do not belong in this world.
The sacrament of marriage is a special thing that bonds two people.
I completely agree, it is hard for Americans to visualize what is currently happening overseas in the foreign lands.
One of the things that Rafi made clear was that his wife has asked him to stop, but in his mind, if he stops, who is going to work toward peace?
As any of us would do in a similar situation, the majority of Afghans are just trying to survive.
I wonder how many people have been in the same situation as him and how they reacted.
The Muslims that hate and kill people, think it is because it is what they are supposed to do as well.
I tried to listen very carefully when Rafi was speaking about his life in Afghanistan and the work he does in America, but I couldnt fully grasp the meaning behind why he does what he does, until I rewatched this video.
Also, going into this class, I knew that the Quran and the Bible were very similar, just interpreted a little differently.
Its wonderful to be given the opportunity to see things from another perspective.
Not even people from the U.S. would have been as nice to invite a stranger into their home for a drink like the Afghan people did.
I think we sometimes judge as a nation a country that has gone through this much because we only see the dark sides.
Do you really want to be good because you will go to heaven?
Dr. Richards continued on by showing the class a series of images just of regular life in Afghanistan.
When the officer was talking about his perceptions before going to Afghanistan and then how it was completely different when he got there.
After they explained that although the man can declare he wants a divorce, women still can object or at least be compensated for their grievances.
In Tuesdays lecture, Sam had a guest speaker, Bassim talk to our class about his experience with the United States army bombing his and his brothers houses in Mosul.
Rich explains how the time before an operation is a time full of anxiety, he said that this man was really keeping the spirits alive for his friends and to me this is important.
I always end up learning stuff or reflecting about a topic or issue.
I personally would not feel comfortable speaking my opinion in this setting, so I commend those that do.
The media platforms that the majority of Americans watch such as CNN, and FOX, choose the news and details they want to stream.
All we think and hear about is war and terrorist attacks coming from countries like Afghanistan.
I know that I personally assumed that some places where massive wars are taking place, Afghanistan especially, were nothing but dust, destruction, and terror.
The children who are raised on killing and hating and fighting.
I believe with every generation that comes along people are more open minded, as they should be.
Would that person be authentic?
Ive always questioned the sports versus race stereotype.
I agree with so many things that you said.
I never knew that Afghanistan was a normal place to live in, just like America.
It is a journey of astonishment and the experience of traveling and learning about new places and cultures culminates in multiple epiphanies.
I could clearly see why they thought she was Indian but I saw the subtle difference.
It truly gives you another perspective on the world when you look at the parts of the world you have deemed other as just like our own society.
I think we as people here in America can't relate to anything that military goes through and have a very poor understanding of what they truly do.
Overall the class was a very thought awakening one and I feel as though it helped me make more conversation within myself about things such as war, communication, and power.
I completely agree with what you are saying.
what you say about the statistics idea is very true.
In our minds they are thought to be nothing but they are humans just like us.
After many attempts he responded and inform us he is fine, but sadly four men were killed while trying to prevent the mosque from the terrorist who were disguised in an abaya.
When people realize similar values and beliefs, they will see they are not too different.
The Afghan People are very accepting and hospitable, I found the way Lieutenant Colonel Garey expressed his appreciation to the citizens culture and generosity was wonderful and refreshing to hear.
One part of the conversation that I found interesting was the topic of reverse racism.
We all have been in our home spending time with our families and have thought nothing of it.
Needless to say, there are definitely big changes on their daily life.
I watched a documentary a couple of months ago, which was a CIA operative who went undercover in a terrorist organization.
Just as an example, I have an aunt who was divorced 5 times, and yet she believes that those who are transgender should not be allowed to live.
Men should keep in mind that they have to pay child support and pay some kind of a monthly stipend to the wife.
Theyre all bad according to the bible.
By having a dialogue, you may be able to realize that all your parents wanted was you grow up healthy and happy, they want to raise you with good habits and values that you will be proud of; By sit down and have a talk with your teacher, you may be able to understand that all the seemly pointless school works were to help you succeed; By meeting the kid that was being isolated, you may find yourself a new friend that is exactly not the one others always talks about.
I listened to definitions of forgiveness from all different types of people in the class and not a single person could truly define the word and what it means.
The media reports bombings, soldiers captured, individuals being tortured, and much more.
And of course it is tragic when lives are lost and wounded, but what do you do when an enemy attacks you then hides amongst the civilians?
Personally, I think it would be very difficult use the New Testament and books for actual answers because they can be taken many different ways and arent always straightforward.
This may also just be a cultural and millennial phenomenon.
And that same mentality is what causes issues between different religious groups.
This statement is very weighty, and used often in forms of hate, but know one ever talks about the rest of the passage.
Make no mistake though, Afghans are strong and resilient people who have endured thousands of years of war.
My earliest memory was of the attacks on September 11th in New York City, and every day for the next few months I recall the news stations placing the blame on Middle Easterners.
Hearing from Raffi really changed the way I view other cultures just because I heard things from the media.
Not all, but many judge others who are from other countries, developing and creating stereotypes and prejudices against them.
Since it is occurring halfway around the world, it is easy not to take a step back and look at how the war is actually affecting real people like you and me.
The example that everyone knows is when the Bible says homosexuals will not go to heaven.
Some days you still may be angry and hurt, but choosing forgiveness gives you the strength to move out of darkness.
I couldnt help to feel almost guilty for having these false perceptions when I learned that the Afghan people are the complete opposite to what I originally believed.
Do you think it is the way you were raised?
Professor Richards made a good point that people don't usually notice these differences until they travel.
Research teams also value diversity to make their research more applicable.
Sam asked in this lecture what comes to mind when you think of Afghanistan and people thought desert, third-world country, poor, violent, and war.
Until I left that room I felt the exact same, but walking back I reflected on it.
It can also add a connection between you and the people and sometimes you may learn that you are not so different after all.
The fact that this clause was put into the First Amendment shows how important it is for religion to not be associated with the government.
I actually remember sitting in the class and thinking to myself that I should have joined some military force for the United States.
They brainwash people into thinking the country as a whole is awful when they should target the groups that are monstrous, and they should show how innocent people are being affected by this tragedy.
Again, I am the type of person who is not big into politics or anything but is all this worth it?
People believe that they are following their religion when they say they hate gay people because that is what God tells them to do.
I went to a school with about 700 people in just my class so I became pretty adapted and befriended so many people of other races.
Life is short so it's better to forgive and forget, instead of staying angry and potentially living a worse life.
We chose to not pay attention or want to know more about a country that has war, because it scares us.
The United States is a world power and for that reason spends more money than any other country on the military.
I couldnt imagine living in a society that was governed by war and having to face it for years and years.
I completely agree with everything you have said.
I can't disagree with what you've stated since it's truly 100% opinionated.
Now, of course there have been killings across the US related to war or the uprising group ISIS, but we don't see the struggles of our soldiers getting no sleep, barely eating, training for days at a time and putting their life on the line every single day in foreign countries.
Ironically, ISIS who claims to obey god orders kill the people who pray to god in the god houses (mosques).
Whenever we hear about Afghanistan, whether it be through news, social media, or depicted in movies, it always seems to be in a negative way.
The fact that there are kind hearted people who give the American soldiers such hospitality and are opening their homes to them is so moving.
Civilians are vulnerable and has to do whatever they are told, especially when their lives and their families lives are in danger.
America's past is too ugly and negative to just ignore and forget about.
I really enjoyed getting to listen to Rafi talk about whats important to him and many of things he believes.
Knowing this can help us be more conscious of the issues that are happening around that world and make us less ignorant to that things around us.
People somehow are able to look past these other factors, some of which are acts they have committed, as justify discrimination against different people.
The pictures of the mall and traffic jams showed that the people of Afghanistan are like us but living in a world of a warzone.
Most people of the world have similar values and do not want to fight this war.
It was very enlightening and I see it differently now.
I enjoy it when Sam brings guests to class.
He even had tea at a man's house and when you think military or war, you do not think of having tea.
It came to better implement the establishment cause which is the embodiment of separation of church and state.
His unit had identified a man who was a commander affiliated with the Taliban.
That being said though he was also emotionally unstable.
But these obstacles should not hold you back.
He drove away and did not even notice my existence.
The innocent people in Afghanistan already have groups that are against them, so when people in other countries also grow this hatred towards them, it makes the situation much worse.
The pictures of the radical people with assault rifles walking around poor neighborhood sand huts are a much easier sell.
I always thought of history books as important markers for future generations, but I never asked myself if the history books go far enough to cover history in a correct fashion.
LinkAs Americans, the affects of the Afghan war have changed peoples opinions on our government in different ways depending on ones view on war.
I will admit that I didn't really understand the war in Afghanistan.
And it is hard to know if they have prejudice or not.
I also think this will help the U.S. capture the criminalsquicker and will lead to less problems.
I feel like there was never a clear explanation of why a war is happening.
I chose the video What drives you to do what you do under the Rethinking War heading.
They portray the people in those areas in such a negative light that the audience naturally generalizes and blankets that behavior across all the people in that region.
I believe all soldiers should be educated on the culture in which they are entering when getting deployed.
The same goes for every single person I know who is against gay marriage.
They are exactly like we are and war is intruding on their life.
These images and these people make me and many others rethink what we know as Afghanistan.
There are people in Afghanistan who want no part in war.
They would learn that not all Muslims are terrorists, and that they cant blame Islam for all of these acts of violence.
Half way across the world in a country ruined by war, there are still civilians and normal people who have nothing to do with it.
But when we are able to look past that and think of the positives, us, as a human race could grow so much.
Lieutenant Colonel Richard Garey reiterates a couple times in the video clip how he was so shocked by the people he encountered while in Afghanistan and that people in America assume the worst about all Afghans when we really should not jump to conclusion of what we believe they all are but instead be open minded to see that there are actually good innocent civilians living in Afghanistan who are victims to the war as well.
Lieutenant Colonel Richard Garey refreshed my perspective on Afghans by telling the class his experience being stationed in Afghanistan and the shocking encounters he had there.
It was really sad to hear that Rafis partner got killed in the process, and youre right, no one deserves to go through that.
The establishment clause was considered a cornerstone of our country by our founding fathers, but many ignore it or dont know about it.
It is a heartbreaking story and it's just one of a lot.
After a while though, you get used to it.
There are currently 917 hate groups in the United States and most of them are formed upon 1 sentence in the bible.
Sam explains the members of ISIS are men who had basically nothing going for them in life and as a result they were easy to radicalize.
This made me think about my meeting an Iranian when I was an au pair in Denmark.
I guess I never really thought much of Afghan other than how war torn it is.
It was a simple question but it meant a lot more.
People from all over the world come together and have children with one another and I find this to be a very interesting topic to discuss.
I find this class very fascinating because I am an authentic Asian and even I found it quite difficult when given the task of classifying people that has Asian features into racial categories.
As citizens of the United States we do not really think of these people injured and we are not entirely to blame.
Even after his friend and fellow prosecutor was killed, Rafi continues to teach law and prosecute civil cases for the aim of peace.
According to Rafi and Dr. Richards, there are constant threats on Mr. Rafi every single day.
Reverse racism can not exist because white people were not colonized, enslaved, deprived of resources and stripped of basic human rights throughout history.
We as Americans often push the thought of war going on in the world back in out minds and repress its existence.
He kept repeating the word real to emphasize it is a place with everyday people.
It seems obvious that citizens of Afghanistan are people, but it was shocking to me to realize the extent to which we let our lack of understanding convince us of nonexistent singularities.
However, when it comes to their own children in a mixed relationship their opinion tends to vary.
They want to impose laws on abortions, sex education, teaching evolution in schools, and so many other issues based on religious reasons in fundamental opposition to the constitution.
I could not even do it on a small scale with next to nothing on the line.
They would not show who the Afghan people truly are.
Islam come from the Arabic word Salam which translates into peace.
The Dialogue Project is a great way to start to do that.
Yes, we are updated and aware on the current issues of the world, but are we really if we do not perceive Afghanistan to be a country full of real life people, traffic jams, shops, and families.
Just like Sam always emphasizes, he wants us to think, and this class is to make us think rather than judge any other country or nation with stereotypes.
On the contrary, Islam is about equality and men are no better than woman it is just that their duties are different.
Sam pointed out that this is very similar to how Sharia law works.
They fail to acknowledge the fact that there are people, just like us, living in the country.
The facts, updates, and statistics are only known to those that keep up with it.
But that does not mean people in this country could not live happily.
I went to Catholic school and my family goes to church every Sunday and thats always how its been.
Were just lucky enough not be born in a war-torn country.
No matter how hard it might be I think everyone should always focus on the good things about themselves and just go with it.
So many Americans get scared when they hear Sharia because what comes to mind are Muslims and their way of life.
We can't start developing these poor ideas about other people from different parts of the world because I think the media kind of twists how we see them.
I cannot even imagine what it is like to live in a war zone like Rafi.
I can easily distinguish a North Indian from a South Indian only by looking at them!
I agree with your statement anyone who is athletic and good at hockey can be good at basketball and vice versa.
It is only by talking to people face to face where emotional connections can be created and understandings may be established.
This could be more difficult in that it is harder to do research than it is to just form biases based off of social media but is needed to reduce conflict.
The people of the Afghan village had all three of these qualities and Im sure there is even more we can learn from them.
They are more alike us than I ever thought.
I grew up in a bubble almost, where the rest of the world was irrelevant and the only thing that mattered was making plans with friends and going shopping.
This is shockingly less time compared to rules in some states here in America.
He decided to not let anger win even when he had every right to.
It emotionally touches us in films we see today.
Even though this is hard to admit, I have this feeling that a lot of us live in a bubble, especially when we are at Penn State.
I think that religion is a very interesting topic, because there are so many different perspectives and ways to interpret it.
We have forgotten that the battlegrounds of war house real people with real lives.
Sam is correct when he refers to them as essentially the same book.
Also, in the US, I think we have a different understanding in our minds about what members of the Taliban should look like.
To understand that these events are serious and are happening to people just like us.
This infuriated my Baba and the rest of my family and no one to this day truly knows how to not be angry with her and forgive her.
In addition to this, referring back to class last Tuesday, these people are like Bassim.
Its interesting that these are two main reasons a woman might separate from her husband in Islam.
As Americans, all we see is what the media wants us to see because that is our window to the outside world.
It also says that if you apologize for what you have done god will remember your sins no more.
I grew up as a Christian and my mom always used the Bible as a framework of how she lived her life.
Its truly scary to think about.
Another issue I found interesting is when LTC Garey and Sam speak about the generosity of the Afghan people.
Their religion is based on love while breathing out forgiveness.
When he was saying this, I was thinking to myself Well yeah of course they are real people.
It is somewhat hard to believe even now for me.
And people are still ignorant because they believe that USA is fighting for their people.
Too many people are either unaware or look past the fact that different climates throughout the world require not only humans, but other organisms to develop certain traits.
He wasnt just mindlessly going in as a soldier.
While US culture and Afghani culture may differ in this sense of hospitality, this lecture has still helped in changing my perspective towards the Afghani people.
Why are we bombing areas which have no role in the war?
It was interesting to hear about how Sam talked about Christians.
The number of Afghan civilians killed continues to go up, and obviously this pointless killing is not helping anything, otherwise the war would have ended earlier.
Before participating in this program, my notions about this country were admittedly naive.
I agree with you that it is truly unbelievable that Basim was able to forgive the united states government after everything they put him through.
Do not even eat with such people was a normal concept to accept because those actions and ways of life were appalling to the average person.
We are endangering the lives of people that we think dont matter.
Bassim, being a normal civilian, minding his own business, not causing any problems, and living a normal life lost his light, his daughter and wife, because of an accidental bomb.
With stopping the spread of terrorism many civilians have died with that effort.
I think that the truth about war and what actually occurs is hidden from us because when history is being taught to young individuals, the graphic and unpleasant portions tend to be left out.
I never really thought about divorce in a way that only one party had the power to do it.
I never thought to represent the citizens too.
There is much more to a country than the conflicts that reside within its borders.
A huge majority of Americans see Afghanistan as a torn down country that has always been at war.
The number of civilians killed continues to rise and unless something is done about it, the number will keep rising.
Why do people have to put their lives on the line and why are civilians losing their lives?
I think an important distinction to make is that news companies were created to make money, not give you the facts.
Times are changing quickly and people are becoming more progressive and opening their minds to new ideas.
I watched the What Quran are you reading?
I was surprised when Sam said the Quran and New Testament are not very different, since I as well as many others thought the two religions were differed in a lot of ways.
Sure, places have different scenery and style just like if you travel across the United States, so just like that around the world is very much like us.
If we were shown a thriving town then people would sympathize with those in Afghanistan because that could have been us.
We cant pick out the ones that are easiest to target.
The biggest difference is their geographic location and the unfortunate fact that they are caught in the crossfire.
The church has a long history of changing words in order to benefit themselves.
In my own interpretation the people knew that not all things could be solved by the Bible and human law was needed just as it is today.
These people are just like you and me, they have families and friends who in many cases are killed for no reason other than that they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
It is supported by the few who are raised to be radical themselves and are blind to the wants and needs of the many.
It was an intriguing and insightful lesson for the class because he really showed how individuals who practice Islam get a bad rep when in reality the majority of them are rather peaceful.
I agree, if we follow a specific religion we should abide by all the rules not just pick and choose.
I am still learning to see these differences.
It is anywhere the two sides go.
I think this shows that the Afghan people are fundamentally similar to us.
The first thing that came to my mind was war.
Nicole, I couldn't agree more.
Another factor could be that putting faces to the Afghans could make the American people doubt why we are in this war.
Sam also brought up a very important point in which judges cite the Ten Commandments in the court and allow religion to play a role in their decision making.
Sam also discusses how he breaks down peoples facial or body features to help others understand that this meshing of genes and ethnicities helps people understand where they come from.
If you ask me that's BS!
I feel that it is very hard to determine all types of situations by using one book.
While this may be true, I truly believe that the belief that we talk about race too much is one that is a primarily white belief.
I have been repeatedly proved wrong, and this class was no exception.
We also think that all that goes on for them is fighting but that's not the case at all.
This is different from what most of the Western world would probably expect of Afghanistan.
I think the LGBTQ community is more accepting than interracial relationships.
This tends to piss us off because we're not bad people.
I am not saying by any means that I am a close minded person, but the stories about the innocent people living in these countries are rarely reported on.
I grew up Catholic and marriage was always taught to be taken very seriously.
I think that part of our responsibility in empathy is to do our research, understand that people from other countries are extremely similar to us and how we live, and sympathize with others to be able to first ourselves better in their shoes.
Most of the things you emphasized are really interesting, starting with the fact that men in Afghanistan sit down and drink tea to discuss their personal lives before a meeting.
I am Black, but I grew up in a predominantly white town.
For example, at a point in Paul's life he wanted to kill Christians but later realized what he was doing was wrong and ended up becoming a Christian himself.
We all know that there were wars and battles between Afghanistan and United States because of gasoline ownership fight more than twenty years ago.
Christians read the bible and interpret it in all different ways.
They live in a war zone though and face danger in the comfort of their own homes.
The vast majority of the time he engaged with Afghan civilians and secuirty forces to learn about ways of protecting the population.
He showed graphs indicating how many people have died in the war.
I agree that we need to adopt the ideal of tolerance, but there still is a certain line, that if people cross  no matter the religion  there should be consequences.
Experiencing life threatening, sad or shocking situations is something very delicate and going thru these situations with somebody can make partners become even closer and tie them up emotionally.
War should not be motivated by what we can get out of it (AKA OIL).
The idea of Radicalizing the Bible is a scary thing because human society and relationships are so complex.
After comparing the Bible and the Quran in class, I realized that our religions are similar and that there is no reason for us to be fighting wars over religion.
There are a plethora of issues that in the end become too difficult to set legal rules for every edge case in our society based on the teachings of a single book.
The fact that he was there and, like you said, was gracious to share his experience with us gave the topic more meaning.
And little kids like Rafis daughters will be able to do thinks like go to the park without having to worry.
We don't ever see or hear about these horrific incidents simply because like you said, the war hasn't been on United States territory since 9/11.
I also thought it was interesting that he brought up that most hate groups in the United States are Christians because they think it is what they should do, fight for what God says.
I think a lot of the reason why many people in the United States have this opinion is because the media here portrays the Afghan people in a bad light.
Rafis sweet little daughter will never feel like me.
Oftentimes, when we think about war I feel we dehumanize it and do not really think about the actual lives that it effects, especially on the other side of the fight.
Men cannot just divorce and move on with their lives like nothing happened.
I would fear for my life and never feel safe when I left my house.
Some people decide to leave their life in hopes of not failing final judgment from god.
Very few of us pause to think about the people being affected by these tragedies.
Of course, you would want to get brownie points for the good things you do in the eyes of a higher power, but the problem is who decides what is to be good?
I think it interests me so much because my dad is a divorce attorney, and comes home most nights with crazy stories.
This often leads groups of people to agree on certain standards for what is right and wrong within that society and culture.
Following the 9/11 attacks 16 years ago, Bush saw this as a reason to gather our troops and immediately send them over to Afghanistan.
I am very fortunate to have had the opportunity to meet and listen to Rafis story.
They do not need more hatred.
Is was impressive to see how in a small province a sort of election campaign is held.
In this video I was not able to her the man talk about his experience.
I think it is important to realize that people are not always the stereotypical version of who the group they belong to.
It's heart breaking to think about.
There was an attempt to suppress this racial tension with the Civil Rights Movement.
I also agree with what Sam said about speculating without experiencing it first-hand.
In addition, I want to talk about ISIS, as a fact ISIS do and did bomb in Arab countries and also mine (Saudi Arabia).
Although war is much closer to them, they still live out similar lives, have similar ambitions, and wish for similar peace.
I think that everyone should be better educated on the military because sometimes they can get a bad reputation because people are not educated enough.
For instance, when I think about France, images such as the Eiffel Tower and endless lavender fields immediately come to mind.
Most of them are just trying to survive the conflict.
Lieutenant Garey stood up and answered this question and I believe, shocked many.
WhenI ask my parents about this topic they are less traditional in their thoughts.
Despite all of this guess what, the media does not show any of this because it is not convenient for this country.
This is why our governments try to suppress the flow of those from Islam-majority countries into the United States.
The real people also refers to the soldiers that risk their lives and leave their families to defend this country.
Overall his stories were very heart touching I toughly enjoyed this part of lecture.
This quote really moved me because before whenever I would hear about the war or a bombing, it never really felt real to me, but as soon as he put names to faces or shows pictures of things other than war, it made me realize how flawed my perspective of Afghanistan really is.
Why cant every country just find their own peace?
All these citizens want is for the fighting to stop in their backyard so they can live in peace and have a pace for their family to grow up.
Seeing this from a Christianity perspective really shines a light on what most Islamic people must feel.
I feel that people who are not people of color worry about this and I would like to know what they think of this statement.
I was very intrigued during class two weeks ago when Sams friend Rafi spoke to us and answered our questions about his personal life.
There have been numerous amount of scientific studies that show that evolution is undisputed.
Normally you would not want people to point out to your physical traits, like a sharp nose, or large forehead, as it is embarrassing to call attention to things you are sensitive about.
Black is not synonymous with African American and I think it was an important thing that Sam pointed this out to us all, because it's something that I think a lot of people don't realize.
I picked this video because I believe that what Dr. Sam Richards is talking about is very true.
I think that classes like SOC 119 and other open-discussion forums are the best way to get past racism.
Even Sam commented that Jeffton was failing miserably during the process, but everyone was surprised by the results.
I believe dating outside of your own ethnicity is a good thing because it exposes you to other peoples cultures and will make someone more culturally aware.
But the first thing that Dr. Richards said surprised me.
When in a wide and diverse campus like Penn state a lot of the walls of diversity are broken down and people are free to meet amazing students from so many varying backgrounds, but many students are raised in mono-culture small town areas where only dating white girls could be the same as only knowing white girls.
In that time, I was told that God created the world and everything that lives on it.
There is only one person that has ever guessed where I was from and I was really impressed.
These means that humans were not in control of the way that their bodies have changed over thousands of years.
The question itself was very tricky in my opinion, any wrong selection would make the speaker sound unfriendly to some group of people.
I also agree that this lecture was very interesting and stood out to me in a lot of ways.
I found the video Do We Talk About Race Too Much?
Looking at this culturally, it could be from what you grow up playing or admire like Sam talks about in this video.
Nobody ever used to play in the south because they didn't have indoor arenas.
Rather, the culture in which that person was raised in that is the primary indicator of what they might be like.
Melanin helps protect the skin from UV radiation.
Although they give us the most business, we dread them coming in and this is because no matter what race we are or where we were born the Syrian's make us feel as though we are below them.
He grew up in the America that threatened to lynch him on the way home whilst stamping he and his mother negro.
Plus if you strip down race to just biological differences between groups of people, people are still going to use these differences to be racist.
I feel like he doesn't believe what he said, but just did to applaud the Indian student for standing up and speaking his opinion on the matter.
It follows logic that if there was prejudice and racism in our countrys history, then there certainly is prejudice and racism in society today.
Nobody seems to want to talk about the Japanese internment camps during World War II.
We enslaved their people, and clearly crippled their ability to progress.
Plus, the terms of blackness and whiteness didn't just appear out of nowhere.
I have grown up in a very diverse area, so I am very ignorant when it comes to racist stereotypes that people have of interracial couples and so on.
I believe that if each class level or tax bracket, had an equal proportion of people from each race, that sports would not be dominated by one race but be more diverse.
I agreeat this generation is by far doing a better job of trying to achieve justice and equality.
I learned last year from a Japanese friend of mine, that that was not the case.
When Sam mentioned how nobody wants to look in the mirror and think man I am poor and I am responsible etc and he is absolutely correct.
One of the female actually wanted to date me even though I barely was there for a month because I wasnt Japanese.
This racial hierarchy puts people who identify with the label White at the top and people who identify with label Black at the bottom.
I think that by realizing the geographic feature that some people of certain colors and ethnicities have, we can become more understanding.
I wrote about this same topic and found your response interesting because it was very different from mine.
Joshua, I could not agree with you more on several of the points you made.
Its main use is very productive, and it can truly be an asset that helps both Sam and us in lectures.
This doesn't necessarily mean overseas travel.
It dehumanized people and caused so many people to not live the free life they should have lived.
I believe that the way we view the world is limited by our personal experiences.
Sure there were protests on campus, but we mostly showed respect to each other.
College classes are so different due to that you can schedule classes based on a topic you like, not just an English or math course you are forced to take because the state says so.
There are countries that have deep rooted culture and rich history that is one to be proud of.
Race has very little to no correlation with how athletic someone is.
But, looking back it was very obvious to see the disapproving looks, especially from the older generations.
Listening to Sam today, I thought about flipping the script.
I agree with you mostly that sports are not inherently racist.
The second reason that race is such a big deal is that Americans have never come to terms with Slavery either.
I posted about an entirely different clip, but had similar comments.
I completely think that certain people being racist are based on how they were raised.
If that were not factored into the choices, then I think it would be a lot harder to find any differences on the outside.
I happen to be a white male that came from a predominantly white suburban area, but I am attracted to black woman as well.
He compared African Americans to each other and showed the lecture hall why even white people across the world are nowhere near similar besides their skin.
I also agree with Olivia on how different college is from anything we did in high school.
Travel for the purpose of experiencing various cultures is essential to get a true understanding of the world.
In my opinion the small differences in the way we look are super interesting and learning what made us evolve the way we did in different parts of the world can teach us a lot about our history as a species.
America absolutely does have an issue with race, being that our country was founded on racism in the first place, but not everyone is out to get one another in the way that it is seen to do so.
Sam gave the example of India where the caste system still exists that places people in clearly divided classes.
But going back to my original point, this type of thinking needs to start in the classroom.
In a class about race and ethnic relations, you are assumed to know little to nothing about how we really perceive different races.
Growing up I always felt like I had the best of both worlds, but society seemed to constantly try to prove me wrong.
Although I feel like some people agree with these stereotypes because of the economical and political state that other countries are in.
People need to talk about race for progress to be made, and it's hard to find the right place to do that.
I also liked how Sam decided to use Lebron James as an example.
I can relate to wanting to be more active with the social media accounts as well.
It is difficult to break mentalities that have been in place for such a long period of time.
Talking about racial issues is always hard, but is something that needs to be done if we wish to overcome them.
As Sam said in the video, we are 99.9% the same and I don't see why those in the Alt Right and the rest of the racists do not understand anthropology and that .1 percent is the only difference between each individual.
Most of the people who were lined up varied dramatically with their racial and facial features; however, the most striking thing is that their place of origin varied from what people would conventionally think of at first glance.
People think the U.S. talks about race related issues too much because its always in the news and a hot topic, but its one that needs constant attention in order to curb racist and ignorant behavior.
With everything that is going on in the world (racism, nazism, discrimination and more) it is important that everyone understands the root of these issues and what they really entail.
I also liked Erins comment about how we have to remember to use social media in a respectful way.
Though it can be a very positive thing it can also be used in wrong ways as shown in the video.
This is a huge problem in countries that are made up of immigrants.
I had never really thought about that.
Race has always been a sensitive issue in the United States, one that you hear news reporters lamenting over on a daily basis.
Then, Sam said that we are 99.9% the same fundamentally, it really had me thinking.
Overtime the noses will start to get larger because they evolved due to the environmental conditions.
That is, people of these groups in the middle who can pass for white often will in order to benefit from the luxuries and privileges that lighter skinned people are afforded systematically worldwide.
In all honesty, I don't think his opinion would change too much, but my Nonni really loved the video.
Race is a popular way to categorize people because it is mostly visual.
I remember speaking to one of my friends that I made here and I was complaining about the lack of diversity on our campus to which she was confused.
Most Alt Rights deny hardcore scientifically proven facts and still claim their superiority over others- which is very alarming.
This is simply because baseball is so important to their culture.
However, this will not happen until we evolve more as a society and people of different races are of more diverse economic status.
Personally, I am not someone who is can point out racial/ethnic differences if my life depended on it.
OI thought your last line was said perfectly.
I I liked how he called up people that looked different, but some had similar features.
You point out some really great things in your post and I enjoyed reading it!
I am from Panama and of course every time I speak English, people ask me where am I from.
Most likely, people fail to look beyond the skin color or dialects of a person and only notice how that person looks different than them.
Becoming more equal socioeconomically as a society must happen before we all become of one mixed race.
Golf has become a huge sport for the asian culture, which shows that the game is growing and welcoming people from around the globe.
I also found this discussion very interesting because I too could not recognize the different skin tones.
One of my grandmothers was Southern Italian and when I told my mom about this class discussion, she said her mother would literally say she got black in the summer to describe how tanned she got.
I think that if more people understood this fact along with the causes and motivations that cultivate racist beliefs, the racismwe see today would appear more like a solvable problem as opposed tosome omnipresent phenomenon we are powerless to fight against.
My family is from Ecuador, but I have been called Italian, Egyptian, Japanese, and Israeli.
As an international student, it is actually easy to tell.
Grant, this was a pretty insightful response with facts I had not yet heard of/thought about before.
Once we break out of our bubble and have our own experiences in other countries, we can begin to realize that everything isnt like what were always told it is.
Because of countries like Japan, I believe that it is hard for the world to become of an evenly mixed race.
I think this should be discussed more and looked at.
However, I have friends who fall into the category of the white males who are only attracted to white girls.
In that sense, I do not think it is talked about enough.
I go down to Mexico almost every year, and I constantly hear the comparison of black Mexicans vs. white Mexicans.
Specific trades/family businesses are passed down from generation to generation, but so too are sports like lacrosse, which is a big part of Native American culture.
My mom told me that when she was a teenager, she was really upset whenIsraeltold her that he turned down a job teaching at a college in Texas because he wouldnt feel safe because of the attitude about mixed race marriages there.
Hand-in-hand with the realization that traveling the world is inaccessible or undesirable to many came the question of whether there were other ways to help people break out of their self-centered view of the world.
And Jews being ranked the highest since they are the most ethnically similar to the Alt Right people.
But in reality that's not the way it was.
It is a shame that race has roles in the events that have been taking place.
Racism can be displayed and seen on all accounts of color.
(family friends) did the ancestry.com test and all of the children got different results.
Race has nothing to do with how talented you are at a sport.
Being healthy and happy is what they believed in.
I think everyone should learn about other features just as Sam did when he did the grouping.
Hell say things like outrageous and thats electric to describe things that I would normally just say something along the lines of thats hilarious or thats wild.
Different subcultures such as African Americans or Hispanics tend to be judged by the way they speak and pronounce different words and this can cause a negative outlook on their subcultures.
Because of geographic locations and climates, the .01% difference in everyones genes have evolved over time to create what we have today.
It's all the same nothing has gotten better its just a lot more subtle in today's world.
If I remember correctly this discussion began with the talks of white supremacists and their recent actions in Charlotsville, Virginia.
I have only ever known the USA from the inside.
We do get very dark in the summer.
I've seen many people use race in a divisive manner to group together individuals in order to make blanket judgments about them.
I found it very interesting when Sam started comparing the physical differences between the Nigerian volunteer and the other student.
With the point of the exercise, I agree that we need to fight our urge to just someone automatically and try to observe and just generally become more aware of people and cultures outside of our own.
Hed also said the easiest way to tell was by the eye shape, but even that is kinda difficult without really knowing the differences to be looking for.
So I get what you're trying to say, butin reality it's much more complicated than that.
It is interesting how just because of where we randomly ended up on this Earth is what determined what kind of human we would be.
As you said, racism isn't exclusive to blacks in America; there are many ethnic groups that faced racism upon immigrating to a new country.
There is a common perception in the US that white individuals typically come from a middle-class to upper-class family.
I feel this contrast of culture is part of what causes each person to go towards they sport they do.
I am not promoting one ideology or belief over another.
It is no coincidence that people of color make up about 30 percent of the United States population, they account for 60 percent of those imprisoned.
He makes the content as interesting and opinion based as he can, so kids will actually care about the class and not pass it off as just another class.
Id been talking to him about how I wished I knew a way to tell the difference just by sight because I wanted to be able to try speaking Japanese with people of Japanese descent, as I am a Japanese language major(As making mistakes in trying to speak to someone who is not of Japanese descent can be more than a little embarrassing and seem very presumptuous on my part).
I also thought of all the many casinos in South Florida where I live and how they are named after Indian tribes and how the land the casino is built on used to be owned by Indians.
There were people posting negative tweets about a student who stood up to respond to Sam's question.
I totally agree with this analyst of our country compared to others.
Reading your response allowed me to open my eyes to what a lot of people actually think about interracial couples.
I like how I am able to go on twitter and see how people are reacting and live tweeting just as if I was on twitter seeing how people react to the Super Bowl or another big event like that.
It's a topic that has been talked about a lot.
I think it's really important not to generalize races because you never really know where someone is from.
I found this very interesting because it is completely right.
A sport that was not talked about in class was golf, which is known as a sport for snotty white rich old men.
One of those being, like he said accents.
A serious motion for change and the dedication to fix the inequality Americans live with in society today would be a great step towards fixing a never ending problem.
There are actual theories and scientific studies conductedthat continue to feed into the idea of genetic difference between race.
I was born and raised in Philadelphia, and despite a few vacations abroad I have never lived outside of the United States.
The incident that happened in class was that people were not thinking thoroughly about the speaker's input on the question.
It is crazy to see how people from similar areas of the world can look so different.
Ever since Christopher Columbus and that whole thing, this country has always had more than 1 race of people, which is quite uncommon in a lot of other countries around the world.
We are all humans and no one will ever all agree on something, but instead of attacking someone and being hurtful, it would be better to either speak what that person says or just be respectful and not say anything at all.
My family is super close but I did everything by myself since I started middle school.
I feel like there are several reasons that factor into the racial disparities seen.
Type A people do not affiliate themselves with either liberal or conservative ideologies.
It's a subtle way that racism has snuck into our vernacular, and something that we should work to erase.
In no way do I believe that racism has ended.
I hope that one day we can all agree on how amazing the diversity of our species is rather than focusing on the diversity itself.
They may pick an ideology based on their parents beliefs, friends strong views, or the region they grew up in, but they did not form their own opinions.
We all know how important it is for a child's psyche to grow up watching people they can identify with on the media.
I wish I was more educated on this history.
Everyone is basically the same, so growing up with this race and the differences in race have never been a big thing.
I certainly don't think it is.
As much as I would like to point to parentage that is more than just black (such as Jamaican or Haitian like your examples), I have no written record of my parentage (due to slavery).
My freshman roommates friend from high school lived with an Asian roommate, and had Black and Indian suite mates.
It is very interesting to actually see the differences in peoples faces depending on where they are from.
My Nonni (my grandma) and her three older brothers traveled from Sicily and started a new life in Manyaunk, a neighborhood in the northwestern section of Philadelphia.
This is why it is important to travel and experience different people and environments different than the ones you are used to.
In the video when Sam talked about if he had passed by those two girls quickly he would have thought they were the same race too, but if he had stopped to really look at them he would be able to tell the difference, I found it very interesting and realized I would do the same thing if I walked by someone quickly.
To be honest that made me feel unconfutable.
The discussion in this video helped me think of the subject of race in a different point of view.
However, I do think that there is some truth to both claims.
Another thought I have is about writing papers.
This is why biology and sociology go hand in hand.
People were sent to camps just because they were of Japanese descent.
My father was born in Japan and my mom was born in Norway, and it always blows my mind that two people on the absolute opposite sides of one land mass eventually married and how small the chances were of my existence happening at all.
In America our culture tries to create perfection and at times it seems as if people are rewarded for changing themselves artificially to achieve beauty.
Generalizing the sport as racist is simply not correct.
It might be true that black people have a more natural physical capability to perform certain sports than white people do purely because of their genes.
As an American, I understand your mentality as someone who feels that America is the greatest country in the world.
We all come from different parts of the world but are one human all together.
A good friend of mine in high school was black and he had a white girlfriend.
We should try to see it from different perspectives and grasp that it is real.
I believed that people with straight teeth were fundamentally higher than others whose teeth were not straight and I realized you couldnt base people off of appearances.
When I think of the damage that was done by Columbus and his men, my heart breaks for the Native Americans.
I feel like there are several reasons that factor into the racial disparities seen today.
The realization that these things came from historically planted precedents helps us to better understand why things are the way they are.
This activity really put in perspective how hard it can be to know a strangers race.
Racism is not the same as it was four hundred years ago.
I have often watched sports throughout my life and wandered the same thing.
The point of this exercise is that it's really difficult to pinpoint someones background based on appearances, so we should all try to stop judging people that way.
Race has been a problem that I believed was slowly getting better.
The conclusion that you drew from this part of lecture is very interesting and I can not agree more with some of the points that you made.
I remember one time I told a girl that I was from Tunisia and she responded with No, really, where are you from?
I thought you brought up a very good point about how diverse the United States is.
I believe he gave this example to address the fact that the US is not the only place in the world where there is racism.
Because people keep watching, the news networks keep pumping these stories out, which results in a huge amount of discussion on these outlier situations.
Dr. Richards explains how these physical characteristics allowed our ancestors to thrive in the specific climate they lived in.
Sam opened my eyes to see the reasons behind the difference in people of different ethnicities.
The theory of evolution is something that I have tackled to understand my entire life.
I am sure it makes some people uncomfortable but it is necessary to see any type of progress.
Almost half our country did belong to Mexico.
The DNA that codes our physical traits is only a fraction of what we are made of.
When the student went up to group the other classmates together by their ancestral background, everyone expected him to fail.
its interesting to think about but nevertheless is definitely a reality in today's sports.
The person from Afghanistan is like a normal person, he works hard to make sure his family is good.
We have made some strides however some days it seems like history is doing nothing more than repeating itself.
I agree with Sam that most people in America do not even believe in the Native American tribes even exist anymore.
Slavery has been taught to me in my public-school system and I think a large part of my education on slavery has to do with the Civil Rights movement.
After hearing about this is in class I have noticed a lot of features I never noticed before on people who Ive known for years.
I too thought your Korean national fencing team example made an interesting point and helped to further the discussion Sam started during this lecture a few weeks ago.
Personally, people can never tell where I'm from and whenever someone asks me I always ask them to guess because I'm interested in what they'll say.
I would say that it is almost its own culture in my family to enjoy and play football.
He said my characteristics gave him no indication of my ancestry.
This is something I have experienced first hand here at PSU.
People need to recognize the issue before anything can be down because this country is still extremely racist even though some of us may not see it.
People can sometimes be afraid to bring up a valid racial point because they feel like they offend someone.
So how can understanding this racist belief help me stop it?
When we compared the two boys with their noses, Sam talked about the why they were so different in size and length due to the weather conditions their ancestors lived in.
Having a class like this brings to the spotlight the touchy racial and political issues that Sam enjoys explaining and going into depth about.
Both factors about why race is an issue in this country pertained to the means by which this country was founded on.
I think that they are more culture involved.
I wasnt sure how to react to that answer.
We are all human and the differences in our skin and our features is simply where in the world our heritage comes from.
I think the NFL is honestly a great place to do that.
I think you're on to something too and I'm kind of in the same boat as you are.
I think the main issue regarding race is that most people are so uneducated about the topic.
It is funny because even when I am speaking Spanish, most of the people know that I am from Panama because when tend to speak very fast and with many Spanglish words.
I agree with the student who made the point that hockey is a more expensive sport to play growing up than basketball.
There was a large divergence in the ranks that these people gave these 4 groups.
As compared to today, frequently we see race being an issue discussed on the news.
I found the concept trite, repetitive  but I suppose his target audience was the alt-right and not a woman of color.
I believe that we need tofocus on having these conservations with people who may not be so open minded.
So, it was normal to see people of two different race and cultures come together.
This stereotyping and judgmental nature is a very predominant issue that our society must learn to address.
The difference in the nose size is all due to genetics and the evolution of the people and backgrounds we came from.
Is it really worth killing hundreds of thousands of civilians to install democracy?
I believe that that statement is completely false.
He then goes on to explain how the white person is always in front of other races.
Rather it has evolved and taken on a new form.
I cant believe it was so easy for me to assume someone was from the same region based on the color of their skin.
While the beginnings of American infrastructure was built on the backs of slaves, the home that we took them from was prevented from advancing.
I am certain that there is some sort of influence on every athletes life that makes them decide what sport they would like to play.
One student brings up that India doesnt have the same issues.
And whats interesting is, I didnt even take issue with the content of his statement.
I believe that there is a subconscious level that determines a racial preference when it comes to attraction to other groups of people, but it is different for every person.
However,his statement got me thinking about racism that does exist in my family.
I really found that out of all the responses this was one that really spoke to me.I never really seem to think about hockey let alone that has something to do with race.
This country was built from immigrants and it seems that as a country we have forgotten that.
In my opinion, part of it is black people are just built better.
Just seeing how black people can essentially out jump or run any white person just gives them an overall edge in sports like football and basketball.
But then he went on to explain why someone might be that way, which again was something I never really thought of.
Teaching children these principles early in their development has the potential to be ultra effective and can certainly ease tensions between races.
I had never really heard of that mix before and thought it was pretty cool.
People were more tolerant and accepting.
I feel that the visual representations really allow all 700 of us to be fully engaged and interested in every discussion.
I believe that there is plenty of truth to this in a variety of different ways.
What I found very interesting was how the grouping of the people went.
Take Muggsy Bogues for example, he is only 5 feet 3 inches, but he was an incredible basketball player.
It is much easier to tell that someone is black than it is to determine is someone is Catholic.
Like Matt and the other volunteers said it is more common to see someone of an African ancestry in the NBA vs a white person, but this might be because of where and how they were raised, their culture, or the way that each individuals body is built.
This idea still seems weird to me even though I know I am guilty of doing the same.
It just means that they live in a place with better resources.
to me, even if all humans will one day all look the same because all the races will have mixed so much, people will still find ways to discriminate against others.
My mother was born in America however her father immigrated from Ireland as a child.
So, do we talk about race too much?
Sam made a good point in the clip that I had not thought much about before going to that lecture.
For example, the way people in Pittsburgh speak sounds different than the way we speak here in State College.
Thinking about this exercise into perspective, Jeffton was failed from the beginning.
I adamantly believe we don't.
I believe modern white supremacy is the answer.
I am always ready to learn about a different perspective other than my own, but I liked that you had a similar idea about evolution.
It's all about what kids of different regions of the country and different ethnicities watch on TV growing up.
People always ask me what are you because they can never figure out where my ancestors are from just by looking at me.
With that being said, I still thoroughly enjoyed talking about this topic because what Sam said was 100% factual.
At first I was thinking, that it is not true.
We did kill Native Americans to gain land.
Speaking generally, you can say that countries in India are less diverse, but based off of what the student was saying, it seems like they also have their own melting pots of people too.
It has to be the mindset of people.
She texted her mom 24/7 and if she didn't text her mom good night and good morning her mom would call her and get mad and know she skipped class or didn't go home at a normal time.
I think the guy in the video did very well at matching ancestor groups or at least better than I could have done.
Another thing that stood out to me that we did not discuss in class was how most white sport players look up to black players as you listed above.
I myself did not realize it was real at all.
The one who works harder and is more dedicated to what they do is going to succeed every single time.
If you spend a lot of time training, and your body allows you to get good at a sport, it does not matter what race you are.
Basketball is infinitely more popular in that culture and therefore hockey just won't attract black youth to play it because it is not as cool.
That was never something that caught my attention before.
We dont have diversity there.
I could not agree more with this entire post.
I think this video was very informative and engaging to learn that mixed races are the fastest growing ancestry group in the United States.
People also tend to get darker if they are under the sun for a long time.
Now, I know Sam himself does not feel this way- he said it, like most things he says, with the intention of hopefully getting people riled up.
The reality is that although slavery is illegal in the United States there is still systematic racism that is in place in order to prevent the advancement of people of color.
When he pulled up the pictures and showed the one of the girls and said that they are connected the same way as him, I realized that Sam is right.
I have never dated in my race but that may be due to being raised in a mostly white neighborhood.
He said some sports are not even available to play in some parts of the country.
I think if more people understood their heritage and felt pride in it they would feel less pressure to change the way they look artificially.
Racism and violence have been at the forefront recently and I think one thing is going to push us through this: unity.
Our country was founded on racism and genocide.
I believe that blacks simply aren't interested in playing hockey as well.
I was so focused on getting good grades that nothing else mattered.
For example, if this red candy tastes sour, then other candies that are also red will also taste sour.
Ive met some hardcore religious people, and they dont even pray.
The saying an old dog cant learn new tricks shouldnt apply here nor be an excuse for racism.
We need to find a middle ground, which is easier said than done.
I thought this was a very interesting point because I found it to be similar to the discussion in a different class about Christian Sharia.
I found this to be one of the most interesting portions of the lectures as well.
Especially when he made one of guys pair them up in different groups based on how they looked.
This is a pretty heavy question and also a hard one to approach for myself.
for warmer climate type sports blacks are more prominent in the warmer weathered sport.
We did place people in internment camps because they were Japanese.
I also find myself asking why people completely disrespect the thoughts of others when we are all basically the same.
We all have some variation of DNA in us that we share, even if two people are of a different race.
I picked this one because I really enjoy conversations regarding religion and peoples beliefs.
Ive never thought about it before.
That is why in public education we learn a lot about the Civil Rights movement.
My Uncle Denny, who passed away three years ago, was your typical straight off the boat Italian, who didn't think too highly of black people.
Lets take Milo Yiannopoulos for example, someone who often put him in the same group as Spencer.
I think you have a good grasp on what he was trying to accomplish in this talk.
With that in mind, I hope that Sam continues these type of lectures in future classes.
While racism against African-Americans is still very present, some progress has been made.
And I believe this is largely due to the media in the US, with their sole purpose to divide us as Americans and turn us against each other.
He says that the idea of slavery was really what created the idea of racism in this country since it was dehumanizing all these people.
With that being said, there are negatives to this, which Sam outlines in his video.
As I went down the line and tried to match people up myself, I quickly came to realize that it wasnt as simple as one may think.
I grew up in the suburbs of NYC but have been visiting my family in Japan almost every year.
Why can't people acknowledge that black people were treated less than dirt?
If you live in the Midwest you probably have never played lacrosse before.
People who aren't extremists know the difference between right and wrong- and don't all racists believe the same shit anyway?
If anything I think that these common trends come from within our culture.
Hockey was first developed in Canada in 1875 and continues to be popular in the country of Canada because of the country's climate.
I like your point about how important it is for us to widen our horizon and try to interact with the new different cultures.
I appreciate these statements that Sam makes because they can unify our incredibly diverse student body.
Knowing that the person sitting right beside you could be from another continent is incredible to me.
These are two facts that are due to culture, there's nothing racist about this perspective on why hockey is played almost exclusively white.
It is a step in the right direction of making everyone feel more equal in their environments.
I believe it adds a certain element because it is something I have never had in a class before.
Many citizens would answer that question and say that they are in fact racist.
The alt right group claim that the white society is the most evolved doesnt feel right to me.
It leads me to the conclusion that Alt Rights must have some kind of mental disability to deny scientifically proven facts and support their absurd opinions about society- how else can humans be so ignorant and incompetent?
He also talked about how their eyes had a different form as well.
It's actually unfortunate that we don't like to be discriminated against, but we do it in ourown community.
The way I see it, anyone who uses race to put another man down is lacking the self confidence they need to be proud of themselves.
We commonly see this in incidents with law enforcement encounters.
For me to be thrust into the world of the unknown was a little frightening.
I dont think racism was a factor.
I believe what he was trying to say, in his little rant about the accents and facial features, was to be aware of the different physical and vocal features that people of even the same color have.
It's annoying to break people from that type of thought, I usually come off as rude for trying to correct my family members, but they need to know that being darkdoesn't make you less than a white mexicans, and being a white Mexican doesn't make you better than a dark mexican.
I was raised in a Catholic household and I do consider myself a Catholic.
When we travel around the world we see people having different noses due to their certain climatic and survival conditions.
I do believe that there is some creator out there that started us off in the process of where we are today.
Why would a black person believe that whites are the most evolved?
Morgan Freeman brought up an interesting point when he was asked about his opinion on black history month.
And if you start a certain sport at a younger age you are likely to continue playing that sport.
Dr. Sam Richards mentions that it may be difficult to understand how people coming from different parts of the world come together and have children, but in reality, the whole world is mixed up.
Although some sports like baseball, lacrosse and hockey are a majority white, sports like basketball and football are mostly black.
I think it is nice that people take interest in learning where other people are from.
These people might actually enjoy a different perspective, and might take a liking to new things other cultures can share with us such as food, music, dance, and other interesting cultural traditions.
The people that are not affected by racism are the ones that want to just ignore the problem.
I feel that people who are in the same economical standing tend to think and act the same rather then two people who have the same skin tone or facial features so to me it would make more sense to make an inference on who that person is based on their so called class.
Do We Talk About Race Too Much?
I believe it is a personal preference as well as a culture thing.
I am minoring in Kinesiology so the topic of race in sports is one I have often discussed in class, but discussing it in Soc 119 is very different since everyone is more open.
When Lekan spoke about the 5% increase in tan, I understood that only people of different race are able to rank their skin color on a relative basis.
I now know that what makes up a persons racial identity is so much more than that.
The mixing and fusion of different people from different backgrounds with different experiences is what makes our country, and every other nation on Earth, great.
I am guilty of seeing the donate 1 cent per day and feeling bad for everyone in the whole country.
Peoples eyes, nose, ears and overall facial structure is completely different due to where a person comes from.
I hope to have classes in the future that might also incorporate more social media.
Between ice skates, protective gear, and paying for private ice time to practice on ones own, playing hockey costs a lot more than a pair of sneakers and a basketball.
There are many details about people which cannot be made unless one truly knows the background of that person.
The point you made about religion and how religious people do not look at the scientific viewpoint really stuck out to me.
Some high schools are very into their respective sports teams therefore if you live in a neighborhood like that you are more likely to play that sport.
That definitely effects the way people act regarding the grudges that they hold today on one another.
One example of this happened not too long ago, where a racist woman verbally attacked a Sikh Canadian politician during one of his public forums.
I really was not thinking of how we are physically built and the makeup of how we are connected.
This all relates back to being politically correct, something else we discussed in class.
Not even counting the equipment, one must also pay for private ice time at a rink, and there are exponentially less ice rinks in America then basketball courts.
Not to mention that evolution is present in most of our features, which Sam pointed out.
I feel as though the huge issue of race in the United States is something that I've never questioned or thought about because I've never known it any other way.
The events that have taken place in cities in america and all across the globe are things that have been happening for centuries now.
Im glad you found it interesting.
These are just differences which should be accepted and acknowledged.
I also found your background to be interesting and it gives you a good perspective of how racial issues in the United State compare to other places around the world.
This is why there is so much white supremacy in this country.
It really opened my eyes to how different everyone's lifestyle is.
None of my best friends played hockey or anything like that, but my cousins that live in Hershey, Pennsylvania basically worship the sport.
The analogy comparing it to liking a certain gender is very accurate.
Although, at this point, it might be trying to teach old dogs new tricks.
These events and actions do not represent the vast majority of the American population from any perspective, but because they are the ones that get the most attention, everyone voices their opinions on it, which always boils down to people picking a side and refusing to consider the situation from another perspective.
It's definitely something to think about!
Once Sam started to explain how he could tell that she was Japanese/Italian I started to be able to see it.
I work at a seafood restaurant by the beach in Jersey and we have a lot of Syrian families that come in they are our biggest customers.
I think in our society we have sort of established that whites rule.
In my case, it is funny howpeople call latinos Mexicans because they have a stereotype that every Spanish speaking person is a Mexican.
I just wanted to offer a different perspective as to why some people might not be cool with it.
Looking at my own nose, it is very small which makes me think that my ancestors did not live in a cold area.
Now that we understand that prejudice and racism have existed and do exist, I will give my opinion of why this is.
I can agree that people of certain cultures and geographical locations can play a role in determining what type of sport is more or less dominated by a specific race.
Another time this occurred was with Keven-Prince Boateng who also had racial slurs yelled at him during his match against Pro Patria.
One of the videos on the Soc 119 website is about people of Chinese ancestry that grew up in the South of the United States.
I truly believe in the saying we have to study and learn from our history in order to make sure that it doesnt repeat itself.
For example, Basketball and Hockey have two different types of races that dominate the sport.
I also found it interesting how skin pigmentation is determined by our level of need for protection from the sun.
I enjoyed watching this activity because it allowed for people to realize that some of the most minor differences can make each person so unique.
People truly believed Africans and African Americans were less than human.
If these people could not control these factors, then it should never be acceptable to discriminate against another simply due to the color of their skin.
People really truly believe that this is the greatest country in the world.
I noticed that she literally had everything overstocked to the max.
Overall, I do not think sports are inherently racist, I highly agree that is is cultural precedents that can determine what we are into.
I never have really thought about this before but I do feel the same way as you.
Do they genuinely believe that their culture is boring or is it kind of a racial sensitivity thing?
55 being Muslims and 73 being Jews.
This activity proved that there are more than just white, black and brown people and that families from all over the world can have very simple or complex backgrounds.
I believe that people should listen to Sams story and learn from it.
I feel like this class is a good way to educate those that maybe aren't so aware about the issues of race.
America is one of the most diverse countries in the world, and consists of many activist groups.
When Sam decided to call seventeen volunteers to the front I knew that it was going to be really interesting to not only see how well Jeffton matched people but also to find out where each individual was from.
I also like the point that Sam brings up about it being more of a class thing.
Love and race is a tricky topic; of course I agree to be close minded and simply not date black girls is ignorant.
Neither of these things seems likely to happen on a large scale anytime in the near future, so for now I guess the majority of us have to be happy just accepting Sams conclusion that we dont know anything.
The colder climate areas of the world or even of a sport usually tend to have more white people in those sports than blacks.
The way people in the United States perceive others is a very poor practice.
What he said was that it was going to take a white player kneeling during the national anthem to create any sort of change.
When you turn on the news, a majority of the biggest stories are race related, and play on the fears of the viewers.
The darker skin tone literally protects the people from hot climate areas from being burned.
In our class discussion we talked about how most athletes in the NHL are white.
This was mostly through people being so determined to date only within their race and for a multitude of reasons.
What difference do details make?
However, if I wasn't in class I would see this stuff and genuinely want to come to class.
It's important to be respectful and thoughtful of different cultures and ethnicities.
He stared back at Sam looking clueless and made an estimation of two thousand.
For example, people of color are still paid significantly less and are less likely to receive promotions than their caucasian counterparts even when they have equal or more experience.
Why does this image evoke such a strong stance on something I never even noticed before?
I think this example here did a strong job in showing how small and silly our differences are to create argument and violence over, while also addressing the point that the amount of mixed people is growing every year and eventually will be the majority for years to come.
The most recognized issue that happened in America was Slavery.
Of course there are some who still hold strong faith in it.
The United States has a long way to go to solve its racial problems, but discussions like these bring us closer together.
Speaking about race will allow us to move forward as a society.
Football is a sport that is only played in United States, besides a few exceptions.
I picked this video because it was a topic that I found very interesting in class.
Many people hold their race near and dear to them because it is something that makes them different from everybody else, and often times, they are proud of that.
When a student proposed the question why is race a big deal in the united states, many reasons came to my head.
The prime examples were the Latinos who looked as if they were from Europe or America.
Not talking about it and acting like everything is okay wont get us anywhere.
Sports are not about race, they are about being the best.
And before I start I want to say that yes racism is a huge problem in America, but when the conversation was started it was only pointed at the US saying, we are the only country with issues with race which, I believe is false.
Yet I had not even thought about the millions of Native Americans that were killed, and many more displaced from their homes.
I am very similar to Casey in the sense that I have never thought about if sports are inherently racist.
I also agree that financial status also has a lot to due with who is good at sports, not just race.
For this reason, I do believe God helped shaped how we evolved.
Although a lot of people complain about how immigrants feel out of place here, this is an example of a culture that makes us feel out of place in our own country.
I like to think they are a start to a more accepting and culturally aware world.
That is why this class is a helpful course for any member of the Penn State community.
And as long as there is racism, hate, and bigotry, race will always play a huge role in American society.
Id probably fit in Theistic or Naturalistic Evolution.
I really think that where you grow up, and the culture in which you are surrounded is much more important than race in sports.
I also believe it will continue to be a problem if we don't address it properly.
I'm attracted to women of all races.
Japan lets in very few immigrants and is therefore very much not diverse.
I have always looked at the evolution scale without thinking much about it in terms of race.
For example, black kids might watch tv and see the majority of players are black, and therefore, psychologically lean towards playing basketball, and the same for white people and hockey.
Sam's point about great athletes being great at other sports with proper practice was very strong.
Because this is such a large class, social media gives us the perfect opportunity to share our ideas on a more intimate level.
It is something that naturally catches my attention.
I personally, also strongly agree with Darnishas point that interracial couples are for the most part perceived as an exotic experience nowadays.
It almost feels like the class needed that early in the semester to setup the kind of topics and issues that are going to be addressed in this class.
I have a good friend from just outside of boston and he still surprises me sometimes with the way he talks and the different words he uses in different ways.
But you both have to be willing and open to each other's cultures!
I like Brookes comment about how social media makes this information more appealing to our generation.
However, Sam did a good job explaining that it shouldnt be weird to take a closer look at someone because that's how we learn.
The culture that people are in dictates what sports they are going to play.
It is amazing to see that human beings have evolved based on where they have settled i.e) If they settle near the equator where the earth is hotter when compared to other regions.
We counted 7 bottles of contact solution which was absolutely absurd.
The girl in this video seems to be very open to dating people of all races, but even she probably has a preference as to what type of guy she's attracted too.
high school football in Texas) plays a more prominent role in the choices people make than simply access.
If it did, then the NFL and NBA wouldn't be nearly as fun to watch.
Then, there was also a picture of a poor family in a war torn nation.
No one wants to come in second.
That is institutionalized racism.
It's simpler to think of members of a race as one homogeneous group that shares certain characteristics than to consider each of us autonomous beings with our own thoughts, skills, and desires.
For me, what was most interesting and eye opening about this lecture is that all thesedifferent body features are due to evolution and the way humans adapted to different climates.
To both groups, I say: you're right.
He also made the point that there are huge issues such as the war on drugs in which specific races are targeted that the government just doesn't talk about enough.
When Sam explained this I began to realize a sense of pride in my ancestry in a way I had never felt before.
This proves to be true in culture and religion.
And this is why it leads to pigmentation and reduction in melanin in other areas if you go up north or south away from the equator.
I agree with both comments saying social media is a positive aspect of Soc 119.
In my opinion there is no better topic of discussion with the world we live in today than race relations and I feel growth happening every Tuesday and Thursday in Thomas 100.
To start off, in class it was discussed about the misconception of status based on peoples background.
Another thing I noticed that the majority of people who asked me these types of race questions were white.
This is why traveling is so important so we can see that there are millions of other people out there.
Personally, I am dating out of my race, I never really thought about it.
The civil rights movement allowed us to have the ability to talk about these issues openly and that is one of the main reasons why our race problem seems so much more unjustified and horrible than other places.
For example, my father has been a football fan since the day he was born.
But after Sam pointed out they have very different features I could see how they werent.
I don't think sports can be racist, at least not at the professional level.
It will likely not be an easy task for people to begin to look at the world in a different view, mainly because I believe people don't want to.
We are all the same its just a matter of what your background is or where you come from and its important that people start to recognize that.
However, I do agree with you that it is probably a cultural difference that causes these racial imbalances in sports.
You say that we talk about racism to much which encourages even larger public displays of racism which is true in a sense.
Many places simply avoid the discussion all together in safe spaces, and this prevention causes issues to rise.
I did not learn enough about this in my Jewish private school that I attended from first grade through eighth grade.
I think so many people around the world making these claims made it easy for people to buy into it and allowed them to not feel like monsters for what they were doing.
In colder climates this is why we tend to see people with bigger longer noses because they need this feature of their nose to survive.
I am really looking forward for the future class.
As the area the volunteers descended from grew larger, and further apart, the differences became more noticeable.
In reality, every race has the same chance at being in the NHL, but hockey is played by more white people because its part of their culture.
I also found this discussion about genetics to be very interesting.
I think its amazing that something as simple as a nose or eye shape can help you determine what region someone is originally from.
Just like how so many other human features are based on evolution and adaptation, this is one that should not be discriminated against.
I think this was fascinating because we learned that due to different shapes and sizes of their physical features we can sometimes tell that they are from different places.
When Sam was talking about religion, he used a very interesting way to interpret it.
With that said, I do not think sports are racist they are just cultural.
All people are created equal, but sadly, not all can see that.
Her example of hockey equipment being expensive is a good one.
For me, Ive always had this standard assumption that everyone has evolved at the same rate based on the various ancestral needs of each races.
I have a broad range of friends from different cultures so I can say that it is a beautiful thing to be able to learn and open your hearts to various customs around the world.
As I walk around campus now, I am starting to notice how everyone has such different features and I am able to understand why they have their specific features.
This portion of the class I feel like is so crucial and poignant for what we see in the news almost daily it seems like.
Talking about something and finding a solution for something are two very different things.
Once interracial mixing happens and genes start to randomly mix and dominate it becomes nearly impossible to tell a persons exact heritage.
Hard-work, dedication, and confidence are the key factors that decide your future in athletics.
Professor then went around with the microphone and so many people answered such a range of numbers.
In todays society, with everything that is going on it is hard for us to come together and remember that we are one country who live under the same set of laws and are all guaranteed the same rights.
Just like Sam had mentioned in the video, I also think the disparities are greatly influenced by culture.
However, I got hung up on whether that advice was actually useful, and if there were other, more widely available ways to get the same result.
I did not know that lighter colored skin was regarded positively in Mexico.
What makes talking about race seem redundant or overplayed is when people don't know anything about what they're talking about.
However, it is a touchy subject to have a real discussion about under most circumstances.
Those who say they are conservative or liberal, but do not exactly know what that entails, are Type C people.
What you said hit the hammer on the nail.
When I was young, I mainly played soccer.
It can also be used as an excuse to ignore our own problems.
It is partly due to straight up genetics, but culture plays a huge role into the situation.
In this country, especially now, this debate has become very heated as people have very strong opinions over race and if there is a problem with race.
Prejudice and discrimination may be legislated out of our society (for the most part), but that doesn't necessarily reflect the personal attitudes of people.
I considered the fact there might not be a God at all.
I am glad that Sam Richards did this activity so hundreds of people can see and learn all the different genetic traits people have based on their ancestors geographic climate.
Maybe we'll even start identifying as Americans instead of whatever country we came from.
And it might be true that white people have a better capability to perform other sports.
I wonder what features I have that make people think I am Egyptian over Ecuadorian.
There is no excuse to look at another individual's skin color, facial features, way of life, etc and assume that they are less of a human than anyone else.
When Christopher Columbus stumbled upon this land, one of the worst genocides in human history was orchestrated.
I went to a really small high school where the majority of the students had an Irish or English background, so it was really interesting to see all the different ancestries of these students.
I think that sports are not racist, they are inherently an aspect of culture.
Me and her were complete opposites and I honestly think I was able to help her by not babying her or putting up with it.
I was constantly judging and looking at people differently based off of what clothes they were wearing and if their teeth were straight.
Furthermore, Dr. Richards does a great job of explaining how these traits are necessary for their evolution.
My extended family really did not affect my parents at all because they always tell me how rude it is of my other family to make those certain comments whenever the family is together.
However, I do not believe we talk about race enough in a way that can move us forward: becoming educated, learning about different races and how races are affected by certain things.
This makes me feel like Im part of a diverse, intelligent, fun group of people  not just a lecture.
Some of what you found iffy was just a little bit iffy to me.
When I have talked about it in other classes the idea that was common not even that long ago was that Africans and African Americans had an unfair advantage in sport.
They were just completely surrounded by it seeing their local people make it to the pros.
It is a really nice mantra we like to spit out and justify all our actions with, democracy is so great and nothing else compares.
I really enjoyed reading this response because it was nice to see the difference in opinions that we share on this topic.
I think that athletes in each sport are good at what they do because they are naturally built to succeed.
I also never really noticed the differences in others appearances until watching a few of Sam's lectures.
I can remember how big of a deal it was among people who had lived in the town all their lives when multiple African American families moved in.
Just like you, I'm proud of my heritage, but I didn't feel the need to discuss it.
While this is not meant to rebut your opinion, I hope this gives something to think about.
So all in all I feel that some the biggest reasons sports arent inherently racist is because of cultural differences between most people with another reason being because of social class.
Other nations still have race issues or social inequality in some way too but they do not shine a spotlight on it like they do in the United States.
The only thing that came into my mind was the Florida State Seminoles, and how that the campus of Florida State University is where an Indian tribe used to live.
Technology such as iClickers, Twitter, and other social medias can engage students with the instructor and the subject being taught.
When you step back and look at slavery then you give yourself a chance to see why race was created in the first place.
For me personally, I know racism is a very prevalent thing in America among many different races.
If this were the case, we could overlook small differences and focus on the point that we come from the same place.
My friend, he has crooked teeth but that is due to the fact that his family could not afford them and believed that having crooked teeth was not that big of an issue.
I find it very funny that the government does not want to talk about these issues and they tend to sweep racial injustice under the rug and they almost feel like it will eventually work itself out.
It seems as though in America this issue has been covered up time and time again with no effective action taking place.
So to the inbred white guy down south who flies a confederate flag and sports a Nazi youth haircut, we are so much better than all black and brown majority countries.
I cannot believe that we just all of a sudden appeared on this earth one day exactly as we were.
I understood the true argument of his lecture  equal, corresponding evolution.
Now that it is brought up to my attention, I do believe that sports are inherently racist.
Some US citizens don't seem to realize or want to acknowledge the fact that almost the entire western part of the country was once Mexico.
It will just change its form.
We have no actual culture that is our own unless you count black Friday sales and supersized fast food meals.
The reason I chose to talk about when Sam talked about the Black Italians is simple, because I can easily relate to what he is sayingkinda.
Some examples that come to mind are police brutality, gentrification, and Islamophobia.
I believe a student brought up the thought that it may have been because of their economic status.
I remember during this lecture Sam pointed out that the guy who was doing the grouping mainly looked at skin color.
It truly saddens me to see how ineffective the media can make something, and it concerns me with regards to how messages can be spread in the future.
People come from all types ofplaces, and they are going to have different opinions about things.
Like the volunteer Sam picked, I would have also assumed both girls were from the same region.
I found this question and answer to be very interesting as well.
It was eye opening to me as it was to you when Sam was talking about the different features of people from different parts of Africa.
I believe this representation had multiple meanings.
From a scientific perspective, people, having a dark skin tone, are able to counteract absorbing too much UV rays and avoid the risk of getting skin cancer.
When you take the case of the Chinese and Koreans, these differences can be noticed only when you are in a group consisting of both of them.
This is because they are all wealthy and wouldn't be caught dead serving tables at a restaurant.
Hopefully that made sense and I didn't miss your point.
We are most certainly not the center of the universe and we are not certainly not the greatest country in the world.
In fact, multiracial/mixed race people are now growing three times faster than the entire United States population as a whole.
How can a person discriminate against someone if they do not know where they are from?
Racism is ever present in the USA and because of our history with slavery through the civil rights movement, and the genocide of natives, we are in a very rocky terrain.
Yes, it might seem annoying because its all we see in the news, but it is necessary.
Only that it has taken a new form within this country.
When I look at someone who is a different race than me, I tend to notice it.
That makes people angry, especially when a group of people feel (and are) they are being wronged.
The conversation continued and I realized just how deep the United States racial problems are.
This elite group shouldnt exist because we should all be on the same playing field but thats not the case.
Cardiovascular endurance is not inherited from your relatives, it takes practice and a lot of intense training to build your endurance up.
For hockey on the other hand is more dominated by white people than there are blacks.
Without that experience, we don't really know anything about those people, despite what we may think.
If I know how a teacher or professor is going to grade an essay or what they like to see in a paper I will cater my writing towards their preference in order to get a good grade even if it is not something I do not like or agree with.
So I basically have no clue where I'm really from.
I thought it was based on a true story, but did not know at all that it was a real-life tribe in America.
Race is a topic that certainly needs to be discussed, even starting from a young age.
I find it really interesting to view it in a genetics point of view as Sam did.
This creates no constructive content and just will discourage others from speaking their mind freely.
Many news outlets choose to cover the hate crimes and rallies around the United States, such as the Charlottesville rally and the Facebook Live killer.
When learning of these events in school growing up, nobody ever taught us about Native Americans in a violent context.
They were created with a purpose behind them.
The activity also reinforced the idea that the eye shape is one of the key physical features one can use to help identify ancestry.
As Sam said, there's a lot to talk about when it comes to race and the best way to understand is to keep the discussion going with an open mind.
Before taking this class I had no clue at all about how your facial features can help determine where you are from and I think that its super interesting.
It also helped me see that we are really all connected the same way.
While this never stopped me from having friends of other races it definitely sheltered me from my countrys discrimination and outlook of those of color and other ethnicities and this election being the first I really followed led me to ask the same question, why is race such a big deal in the United States?
My friends have experienced the negative effects from it, and I see the awful things that happen in the news.
A single country wont be able to stop racism because even if its only in one place it can easily spread.
Furthermore, hockey is a much more expensive sport which excludes a lot people from poorer foreign countries.
I don't think I'm alone when I say that I don't often stop to think about the blatant fact that our country is founded on the mass killings of indigenous people - which leads me to think that I'm just part of the majority of people who also don't acknowledge this.
One reason I say this is because race can easily be used to target someone.
I was also being not expecting the girl Melanie to say she was very comfortable.
This is where the entire sports and comparing peoples body types conversation became interesting.
This problem could be erased if more people were to travel around and go see things for themselves instead of just accepting the opinion and vision of someone else.
and Sam begins to tap about the difference between Basketball and Hockey.
When you ask a black person what sports they like they never say hockey or baseball because their culture just does not like those sports.If the majority of their race does not like that sport, why would the play it?
While listening to Sams statement about color pigmentation, it is interesting to see the social implications of a biological factor.
So, when Sam started talking about the crooked teeth, I connected right away and I was able to understand the point he was trying to make.
I didnt know if that was polite.
Because her parent's did absolutely everything for her she pretty much had to learn how to think by herself.
So, I did also find it interesting when Sam Richards was telling us about how we can take a glimpse at where we are from based on our facial features.
A human being cannot learn and develop if he was close to himself.
This also relates to how sports relates more to economic standing than race because towns that have more money can afford to have things such as ice hockey rinks in their schools whereas poorer towns cannot.
must include clauses that state they will not discriminate based on race, religion, ethic background and gender.
I couldnt tell you anything about any other countrys constitution so it amazed me that some young child could.
I also did not express much sympathy for them.
Which, while it sounds weird, is true.
The other part is the stigma people feel they may face.
I thought that it was really interesting how there were some people that were Hispanic, but if they would have never mentioned it I would have never guessed that they were Latinos as well.
The scientific mindset of the 17th century is still living and thriving today and has allowed for atrocious groups like Richard Spencer's to exist.
And I definitely agree with you that race has become such a sensitive subject, people no longer want to discuss it in fear of being called out as being offensive or racist.
I could not agree with you more.
This problem has to derive from some history in the past.
I see this white supremacist view everywhere I go in this country.
I was very surprised that any of them were correctly grouped.
I find that these thoughts are not necessarily ones that only certain individuals possess, but rather stereotyping that has been passed down generation after generation.
That also gave me a perspective I had not had all my life-- that not all places are diverse and not everyone is used to having people of different ethnicities around them.
I definitely believe in the science of evolution, I just dont know if a god was involved.
It is backed up by science and research done by people who devoted their lives to these topics, so to me, the theory of evolution makes sense.
All humans share 99.9% of the same DNA, so even if it is more uncommon to be in an interracial relationship, why does it even matter?
This opens the doorway to people being less sensitive about these traits because everyone has specific things they are embarrassed about.
Although there are a lot of race issues going on in the world and so much controversy, especially withAfrican Americans and cops, I think that people bringing the attention to this issue that still exists in America is a good thing.
Unfortunately for them as time goes on they will eventually and inevitably be outnumbered.
It starts off by talking about evolution and how when you think of it at the end is a picture of a white man.
Although it is less confrontational than public speaking, sharing your opinion is brave no matter where it takes place.
Here at Penn State, it seems to get brought up every time I meet someone new at a party.
Throughout high school I competed in junior golf tournaments all over the east coast and the amount of black participants I noticed was no more than 10.
I also very prominently choose not to participate in that racism as I do not agree with it what so ever.
The fact that this would concern me at all is very disappointing and has no place in society.
Race is the reason for some issues in the world, meaning that it should be discussed for the purpose of solving those problems.
Whether the police wrongfully killed a black man, or there was violence at a white supremacist rally, racial tensions are impossible to ignore.
I believe in evolution, but I also grew up with a lot of white Christian classmates who didnt.
For example, in class we discussed how Hockey is predominately white.
Like Sam said in lecture, there are great arguments for both sides of this discussion.
Then, Sam said that the body, mind and spirit are all linked everywhere in the same possible way, I realized that he was right.
Meanwhile, there are just as many groups arguing otherwise: that everyone should be seen and treated as equals despite all race, gender, and any identity differences.
I think the two sides to this argument are too polarized and they should maybe try to meet in the middle and compromise in saying that a creator of some sort probably guided the evolutionary process.
I like in your response how you included your personal experience with cultural shock.
A point brought out in lecture that I never thought much about was how in the United States school system we are only taught to focus on the wonderful accomplishments of our nation, even though our nation was not solely built on those wonderful accomplishments.
Recently, asians have been dominating golf at all levels.
I think all, if not most of us, have that one relative in our family who comes from an older generation and has some racist views towards certain groups of people.
I pretty much always just thought of race problems as the reality of the world we live in, and this question made me step back and think that maybe its not a reality that has to do with the world, but rather a reality that has to do with theUnited States alone.
Yeah, I can say African American, but me personally I find that term confusing for people who are actually African/have knowledge of their ties to Africa and are American, you see what I'm saying?
Using the students to show how the Alt Right view and categorize humans helped me understand their thought process, even if I do not agree with it.
In the next group, there was a half Italian women, but because of her Japanese mother, her skin appeared lighter and less Italian, so she was therefore grouped separately.
I think Casey and I have very similar views on this question.
People that think being a pure native makes them better.
We cannot just assume that one group is fundamentally higher than another group based off of appearances because that is not accurate.
I cannot always write what I want or what I believe in because Im writing to get a good grade.
The goal of sociology is to promote thinking and discussions, and social media does a great job of allowing everyone to do so.
I could easily relate to everything the Italian girl was saying in class.
If people that were less mathematically or scientifically gifted, less politically savvy, or just generally less intelligent had darker skin Well, I know a lot of white people that should be pitch black.
Our culture is unique because were the only Asian country whose main religion is Catholic and whose culture more closely identifies with Spanish than other Asians.
Overall, I think that race is an important topic that should be discussed when it is necessary.
It is so true; reading opens up students so much more and allows the students to learn while reading into something they are interested in.
And then again in spanish speaking countries, like Venezuela and Columbia, the majority in power are white while those cleaning the houses and serving the food have darker skin tones.
When Sam asked a white girl to point out the darkest person in the room, I also felt super uncomfortable.
How come my friend is never referred to as Asian or white?
We look different but were all the same.
Also, if someone likes another persons personality, they instantly become more attractive despite their race and ethnicity.
I liked how Sam brought up his firsthand experiences in India and Columbia, as the student who spoke in class might not have had as much insight into the issue as Sam does.
Sometimes people just need to sit back and listen instead of talking about a topic they know nothing about.
It was wrong for people to attack Hayden, who was brave enough to get up in front of the class and voice his thoughts.
In class we talked about how everyone is 99.9% the same, so not one person is limited to strengths in a certain sport.
It made me really happy to discover from the military speaker that he liked working with civilians and didn't have a prejudice against them.
You need to read into the deeper reason to why one race succeeds more than another.
Although I do think this class helps to take away some awkwardness when talking about race, I think it also makes us more aware that they constantly surround us.
This is where multi varied social interactions come into play and meeting a diverse group of people can accentuate this understanding.
When I ask my parents, they will list 10 or more different regions that my ancestors are from but I would love to actually know the details of the story behind my genes.
I agree that the United States is a big melting pot of different religious beliefs, races, and ethnicities which vastly contribute to the reason why we bring up race so often.
It made me think that praying is less of a religious act, and more of a reflective or spiritual experience.
We need to humble ourselves and realize that people are wealthier than us but also poorer than us.
You also see a lot of professional swimmers from places like Florida or parts of California where it is common to have pools open year round.
Even just having one person be affected by this type of conversation is a step in the right direction.
The Civil Rights Movements have definitely given a louder voice to those of color and other minorities, but until everyone decides to fight for one equal path then we will always be at battle with inequality and unfairness.
In conclusion, I certainly believe that sports are not inherently racist.
Even now, after Tiger Woods proved to everyone that a black man can play professional golf and be successful, there has only been 1 black player to join the professional golf tour since 2011.
On the other hand, it would be dishonest to pretend that racial issues don't still exist in our country.
It depends on where your grow up, who youre raised by, etc.
We are never shown the people who are thriving.
Many people are not cultured enough to see that people have made flaws in every ethnicity.
I have been all around the country but never outside of it.
There is absolutely no evidence to prove that these claims are true, and honestly those who do make claims such as these are most likely uneducated about racial differences and human biology as a whole.
On the other hand, I believe this shows how close we are as a society.
If we all viewed this evolution diagram how Sam discussed it, perhaps there could be more advancement in this thought that Black Lives Matter and other movements may not need be a thing because we wouldnt value the white race over others like some supporters of the All Lives Matter movement do.
I also like that political boundaries were discussed.
Our history is long, it is complicated, and it is ugly, just like many other countries in the world but we are unwilling to recognize that we also stooped to such levels to build this beautiful country.
Even though the volunteers from the video were all African and had some similarities, each person was unique in different ways.
(Side note- I am a white girl, and therefore enjoy white privilege, so why is it so uncomfortable for me?
To me, there is very little for us to be proud of in this country other than our music and film industries.
I also come from an Italian family but have a different experience than what Sam described.
I personally thought that everyone in third world countries was living on the streets and struggling.
However, I still do not think this is always the case.
If we talk about it so much why is there still so many issues when it comes to race?
Hed told me not to sweat it because even he has trouble telling the differences between other asian people.
The difference between the melting pot of people in India and the United States is their way of dealing with race discrimination.
It is not only unfair, but concerning that there are so many individuals with this mentality.
Part of this is because there really are not an abundance of people who are not white.
Reading is absolutely other way to discover the world around us.
I do believe that some races are better at particular sports than others, but it is more of a cultural thing in society today.
In the same class, a kid who raised his hand didn't want to refer to a student in the front as black so he just said the guy in the red shirt.
It might just be subjective, but I have always been curious.
For example, comedian Ali Wong cites Asian stereotypes in her shows to show that they are ridiculous.
Even though each volunteer was from the same continent they look completely different, and have very unique traits.
With that said, I do not think sports are racist.
The social media aspect of this class gives students the opportunity to share their opinions and connect to one another.
Her parents paid for EVERYTHING and she didn't really know how to do much on her own.
That is something I have really learned in college.
Although this might sound foolish, there are many different types of living organisms, life forms, species, etc.
Sure, it would not hurt to have good genetics, but that is not a deciding factor in your potential athleticism.
Someone from the north might play hockey, but someone in the south may not have an ice rink.
African students are terrorized in India.
However, I do believe that education is a very simple solution to this thought process.
Another example brought up in the video was how athletes who play hockey are completely different.
Of course I dont believe that physical traits determine what kind of person you are, but so many people do.
And so far we're only doing one of those two things.
I liked hearing the student in this video discuss his stance on the subject, but Sams conclusion and afterthoughts with his firsthand experiences should stand out.
It is not just something white people do.
I agree I loved this and thought it was a lot of fun.
Although it's not possible to change everyone's mindsets, we can change some people's negative actions and words.
These organizations are usually for different nationalities or ethnicities so that new students can find a sense of inclusion and comfort when coming to a new country for school.
The training in Canada is potentially better because it originated there, and most children are put in the sport from a young age because of its popularity.
It's not the race that makes them better than another, but it might be the cultural background and how you grew up with your particular sport.
Now, every time I speak to someone from a Latin American country, I know exactly where he or she is from.
This means that you can never really be sure about what will set someone off.
Racism and ignorance will never go away completely, but constantly discussing it can change the minds of generation after generation.
I did a response on the nose of different people which was interesting to me because it relates as well as hockey and body shapes and sizes.
Having said that, I think there are those who are against such mixing.
I think the only way to properly address the issues of race is through a forum with people talking with other people.
Going along with my own discovery, I think some people could be uncomfortable when Sam is so quick to point out characteristics on people.
Yet, people still seem to have this idea in the back of their head that white people are really the most evolved.
If any person, of any race, feels a connection with another human, then they should be allowed to be together without having other people think of them any differently than if it was a same race relationship period!
The sad fact is racism is all over and a clear example of this is racism against Mario Balotelli, an Italian soccer player, who had racist slurs yelled at him at numerous matches in his career, like his match against Roma.
In order to really feel and have a motivation to change we need to be more connected to world news not just whats happening in the United States.
I think in so many ways sports are the exact opposite of racist because they bring people together.
It is important to understand that the world has been intermingling and changing since the dawn of time and that it is only natural for it to do so now.
The BLM movement preaches equal rights which is altruistic but by labeling themselves advocates black lives they already create a separation.
How could that be true, every person is different and all go through different experiences.
Social medias have the potential of bringing people closer, but also poses potential threats of cyber bullying and hate.
For example, African Americans are usually the ones that excel in basketball compared to all other races, white Canadians are the best hockey players, and Dominicans are associated with baseball.
It is a feature that helps them and should never be used to morally hurt them.
It seems that many people are having trouble seeing that culture will never stay the same and that it is ok for it to change.
She was very very sensitive and I do not put up with that.
Also when I lived in Japan people were treating me as if I were exotic.
Like that black people are genetically predisposed to commit crimes, or that their inferior genetics were the reason why it was so easy to enslave them.
We took land that was not rightfully ours and killed the people it belonged to.
If there had been a civilization of many different races all put together, I'm positive that the generations after them would all consider each other the same, as they would not have any culture barrier between them.
Even if it was by accident, he got a good amount of the groups correct.
Another key factor to consider is just the differences in culture among whites and blacks.
I thought it was really interesting that a student brought up how Pocahontas, which a movie that most kids of my generation know, was one of the last tribes to be considered federally recognized.
In early high school I had a friend who is Jamaican talk about how it annoyed him that people refer to all black people as African American.
I travel to Mexico every year and throughout the years I have noticed that there has been a small change in the different races living up there.
In my opinion this mindset is why racism has been able to prevail so heavily.
I also think that utilizing social media to influence class discussions is a great idea because only so many people can get to speak over the mic every class and its a great way for Sams team to be able to sift through and get the general gist of how people are feeling about a certain topic and gauge frequent questions.
When I called my mom to ask her about why, she explained that is just how he was raised and what the people of his town in Italy believed too.
I think its crazy how Americans really believe they are the best and richest country in the world.
I find the topic of race to be very interesting.
It is not just something white Americans do.
In 2017, the KKK should not legally be allowed to hold meetings and gatherings.
The speaker was then criticized on Twitter by some other students later after class.
If everybody matured knowing that we are all truly the same, as homosapiens, the world would operate with significantly more cohesion.
Dating between races is not very common in my hometown either.
At the end of the day we look the way we do; eyes, nose, hair etc.
At the same time, it is a very sensitive subject to some people so it should be handled with extreme care.
Although I think that golf is a racist sport, I think that aspect of the game is decreasing as more and more opportunities are opening up for minorities to get involved.
However, there are many nice areas such as the showing area that was shown in class.
There is no practical way to control the content of the comments of a user on social media.
I too thought this activity was really interesting!
I was hesitant to put this post up, but I did it anyway!
It also showed the reason why where you grow up and are born has a large impact on who you are and just how over time humans who live in specific areas tend to look the same.
It was nice to see Jefton attempt to group people together according to their background based solely off of their appearances.
Thinking about it some more, I understand why it affects them on an emotional level.
Why can't people acknowledge that this country was built off the backs of slave?
I believe that it is more of a culture thing, just like Professor Richards stated in the video.
The debate around it is one of the largest in the world, so that means that it is definitely important to see both sides of it.
When Sam first mentioned how awesome a students nose was because of the shape and size, I felt uncomfortable.
The point of this class to hear from people of different races/religions/ethnicities and to come together and combat racism and stereotypes that exist in our word.
Basketball can be simply be played with one single round ball and a hoop that can be found at almost any local playground in America.
This country was founded to have the freedom to choose and practice whatever religion you wanted to, but clearly this meaning is lost upon them.
People who believe in both sides of the argument are definitely very passionate about it, so it is important to know what both arguments are and the bases of them.
Specifically, the comments towards the end did a good job of wrapping up that there can be demographic differences that can lead to certain sports being pursued or players idolized.
Of course we don't live in a perfect world so racism will forever exist, but maybe if we can educate people that whether your black, Asian, Guatemalan, we are all 99.9% the same.
Racism is everywhere, other countries hide it better than others, but if you listen to conversations, even for an hour, you can hear the racism.
Lebron James could be good at any sport if he wanted to, however cultural factors led him to choose basketball.
Itd most likely be in suit of him grumbling something about the ignorance of white folk.
We see it in the form of Black Lives Matter, police brutality, campus protests, and various other avenues.
Also, it was interesting to see how even some people from Africa could not tell wheat parts of Africa other Africans were from.
Right now, many people are basing their opinions of the other side solely on the radical minority, which gives them very skewed opinions.
I too would have been awful at placing the students into their respective groups.
It may have been beneficial thousands of years ago, and society should have progressed to where that logic is unnecessary or detrimental.
But to say that someone is sexist for only liking certain races is ridiculous.
These two examples show why there is not intentional racism in sports.
At the core, a sport has to appeal to the individual, because they're the one who makes the commitment.
Even with groups that started just or have good intentions.
Peoples genetics tend to mirror wherever their ancestors for.
I was under the assumption that there was no way for me to have any idea where my ancestors were from, but it is kind of cool to know that there is a way to at least make an educated guess on the subject and possibly be able to at least know what area of Africa that my family came from.
So when Sam continues to talk about looking at people and knowing where they are usually from, I cant help but wonder more and more about my own familys history.
The fact that a black man was becoming the face of a white man's sport was pissing off the upper class, racist white audience.
Sam brings up a topic that I think is the answer to this, it might be culture.
I believe that different environments and characteristics go into influencing certain people to play specific sports.
We are considered a land of many opportunities, but equality is not shown within those opportunities despite what is written in our constitution.
I think people need to bring light of racial equality to these type of people and show them were more alike than they think and theres nothing wrong with it.
I personally, am very much concerned about the issues of race in this country because I have seen, in media, many instances of inequality during recent years.
This is a really interesting topic in my opinion and I believe it is encouraging of what race relations might be like in the next few decades.
I would not worry about dating outside my race because I personally would not care what other people think.
After asking me that question I really started to pay attention to how she interacted with her family.
With that being said, we also should not be whipping out the race card every chance we get, since that only hurts the relationships amongst races.
No one talks about how we barely even know who we vote for on ballots because everything must be an open election.
Grades do put the students down along with the state testing.
Many people I know don't believe in any other option, then shame me for to having the same options.
Imagine me at five years old watching New York Giants games with my father and brothers.
I think this is very relatable because nowadays you see many mixed races all around the world.
And it doesn't mean we should stop talking about race.
I think the accessibility of this class via Twitter is what makes the class feel so free as to say what you think towards what Sam has to say.
In the class alone we had more than six groups of different nationalities and even those groups were very broad.
This was the video I chose to talk about and we agree on a few key points.
People in privileged parts of the country seem to forget that.
I believe that these ranks were more determined by the hatred that the Alt Right people feel towards these individual groups.
People have seen Afghanistan on the news and thats how they form their opinion.
But like Sam said it just depends on what they grew up playing, which is why sport is related to culture, making it a sociology topic.
Richard Spencer thinks the exact way I feel.
At certain times, things may seem racially divided and racist in general, however, there is usually an underlying reason for why things are the way they are and this class aims to answer that question.
It's important to start these conversations at an early age, so children can develop a proper understanding of race relations.
I see this as a case that does a good job of presenting what this class is based on and the pursuit of understanding the social dynamics between different cultures.
I used to be a huge advocate of thinking that America was the best country in the world and in some aspects, I still do, but I think when you look at statistics you can realize we fall behind other countries in many aspects including GDP per capita.
I think a lot of what they are doing, involves race baiting and to flood the news with cases of racism to make it seem racism is a bigger issue than what it really is.
Whenever I hear people referring to getting with another race, it is almost as if they use it to brag, like its uncommon for this to happen.
When pointed out people could assume this is saying that the Black race is the least evolved, then Asians, then Whites being the most evolved just doesnt seem right to me.
The lecture I posted about focused on the traits of Africans.
But not everything is black and white (so to speak).
It makes you think how different we are but yet similar at the same time.
Coming to Penn State was such a change for me, but it taught me so much.
This lecture did a great job of making students think differently about physical differences, and how each and every person in the room is a product of their ancestors evolutionary characteristics.
Kristen, I totally agree with the last statement in your first paragraph when you say talking about race too much is causing it to be more prevalent.
In my response, I stated that open discussion would go a long way to combat racism, however I fully agree that schools should do a better job in educating students on the origins of racist attitudes.
Both sides of my family are looked down on because they aren't real Americans, even though we've been here for decades.
Understanding each other is the key to ending racism, so I have to start there.
And all of that is amplified in America.
I assume that there are a lot of people that acknowledge that other communities have different worldviews and are interested in learning about them, but cannot afford to travel to those places.
I want to add that If people cannot afford traveling, they can alter to books.
It was quite humbling hearing my fellow classmates varied responses to the question; all the valid reasons I never even knew existed.
A little bit closer to home was the 2016 election, that revitalized the racial tension embedded in this countrys history.
I very much agree with you on your point on leaving your bubble.
There are many people who will not want to accept that we are all the same.
You canexamine different races and look at the millions of varying features that we have, but the fact of the matter is that no matter what differences can be viewed on the outside, humans all encompass the same minds and consciousness as one another.
I also believe that the sports you play are heavily influenced by those around you.
When ever people try and get into an argument about if sports are racist, I think of the Little League World Series that just finished about two weeks ago.
I paired up with the girl sitting next to me and I had zero clue the answer to how many Native American tribes are federally recognized.
She never wanted to eat by herself or walk around alone which is something you have to learn in college like come on.
It was interesting to me because I believe that race in sports is a typical thing to stereotype and categorize but we rarely look at the root causes of such differences.
However, when asked about these other issues, Type D people will assume their ideologys belief is automatically correct, without looking at both sides of the conflict.
He talks about how nowadays many people are mixed races if this continues it is going to be the future.
Sports are not inherently racist, what sport you play has nothing to do with your race, but the culture in which you were raised.
It was evident that the girls in the video weren't made uncomfortable by Sam drawing attention to their facial features.
Both professional basketball players and professional hockey players are extremely athletic, they work hard to be strong quick and agile.
I think that the world becoming more mixed over time will lead to less discrimination.
I like how you describe the racial injustices instilled in Chinese culture.
However, there are both black and white people in the NHL and NBA so that is not always the case.
We need to analyze how our government is actually working and if it is for the people or for the people at the top.
I particularly like what Brian Davis had to say on this topic.
People are thoughtful, smart and creative everywhere like the little kids shining shoes because it is our human nature to be that way.
This shows that people are just uninformed about many things regarding race.
We went on vacation together over the summer and my skin was darker than his, but no one called would refer to me as black, just very tan.
I have made some of my best friends (who are black) playing sports with them.
I was at first shocked and appalled as obviously none of these things are true.
Talking openly and honestly about race and our perceptions of racism as it exists today will go a long way in getting over those problems.
However, Sam actually clarified in class that this idea wouldn't work because African Americans don't make up the biggest part of the lower class.
I come from the other side of things as a caucasian but I did grow up in a town with a large Asian population.
I also think the disparities are greatly influenced by culture, like what Sam touched on in the video.
The war on drugs, the war on native Americans, etc., focus on specific issues that target different groups of people leaving them feeling attacked or vulnerable.
It's almost like this class is my source of news, since I really don't watch the mainstream news either.
One must be weary when discussing these race topics though because different people are offended by different types of things.
It is normal to just think that one person is higher than another based off of appearances and based off of facial features.
You have made a few interesting points in here, some I agree with, and some that I do not agree with.
You can't deny the history of sports as it is clear that racism was very much present in sports like hockey and baseball.
I've never really thought much about this question but it really makes me think why it's such an important topic to learn about.
He explained that, like Adonnas hair, our bodies are all products of our ancestors environments.
Together, education and discourse is the ideal pairing to alleviate racism.
Maybe this liberal feels that less government regulation would create more jobs and spur economic growth.
The media depicts all muslims are bad based on a really small percentage of muslim group whereas it is not the case.
Unfortunately, this nation was founded on racism, hatred, and white supremacy.
This would come under the realm of sociobiology where a biological concept has affected people over the ages and these differences have changed the extent of human interactions.
In our discussion group we talked a big deal about this and how our history makes us unique when it comes to separation, division, and or segregation.
Sticking with hockey, it is difficult to put an ice rink in the middle of a city, however you can usually find an already established park with a basketball hoop where kids can practice on.
It really all depends on what sport the athlete decides to play, and that decision is usually determined by culture.
While people may have different traditions and celebrate different holidays, they are all essentially the same when you look past some of the cultural differences.
I believe that we are all different in many ways, and skin color does not define the way we should treat other people.
One response that stuck out to me above others was how the creation of certain cities purposefully disenfranchised a majority of its poor, more ethnic population.
Personally, I havent been affected by racism, but I understand that it is still a huge problem.
When we're talking about race, what are we really saying?
While the volunteers may have been from a similar part of the world, they were all very different in so many beautiful and important ways that should be recognized.
I dont know if I would fully classify myself as Atheist; however, I never really think about religion.
Even though people say don't just a book by its cover, we do it anyway.
In the future, the black kids will follow black athletes which develops into the pattern that we see today.
I agree with everything you said on this post!
I was very intrigued when Sam brought up an interesting viewpoint when he lined all three girls up in straight line in a row.
To prove this point last week Sam brought multiple African Americans to the front of the room and asked them questions, their responses were so different but yet they had the same skin color.
In elementary and middle school, no one seemed to care.
Dr. Richards is very adept at making hard topics easy to talk about, and I think he shows that skill in this lecture above all others.
Traveling and having an open mind to see how other people live is how we will move forward.
Unfortunately, our commander in chief has incited nothing but bigotry and hatred and made it seem acceptable for everyone to be ignorant towards one another.
You inherit physical characteristics from your ancestors, and are born into the cultural environment that your parents set up.
Race could not be the reason of an issue but because it is an easy target to pick on, people choose to target race.
Type E people should not be criticized for admitting they are uninformed on certain issues, but rather commended for not falling into the trap of simply taking the same stance that is accepted by their ideology.
And I believe that culture continues on.
This made sense to me so I agreed with Morgan Freeman and thought that sometimes the emphasis on race may be too much.
Only by listening to one another will we begin to understand each other.
However, some of these differences are amplified more than others.
I was relieved to find out that my parents and family members did not care what race he was, as long as he treated me with respect as they would want any guy to.
I thought this was very interesting too.
While other countries have seemed to accept their racist past, a large portion of our country today denies that race is even an issue.
This is a result of all the years of living in one place.
However, I believe that the good that comes from Sam integratingTwitter into his class heavily outweighs the bad, but the bad is why I'm probably never going to raise my hand or volunteer for activities in class.
We also discussed the body shapes and how black people have longer legs a shorter torso which is why we see more black people running track and running short distance races.
I believe that all of those opinions are stereotypes.
Morgan Freemans solution for the racial divide was to stop labeling people as black or white or hispanic and instead just identify people by their name.
I liked Sams statement that people are thriving in all parts of the world yet we, as Americans, still have this idea that all of Africa is poor because there has been that stigma for a while.
There are a significant amount of Black players in the NBA than there are white by a big margin.
I looked at the same video and didn't pick up on the dehumanizing effects of racism.
I agree with this in the aspect that I would be nervous to be put on the spot in front of a lecture that large.
I know I was at first.
On my mother's side, my grandmother immigrated to the United States, leaving my family behind.
I also agree that no group has the right to say that they are better than another group because genetically, we are not.
If the networks hosted more professional debates and invited more speakers to explain their stance or views calmly and clearly, people may be more informed on the topics and discussions about race issues would be much more productive.
The event that happened in Charlottesville shows the ignorance of knowledge of human history.
All in all, we should talk about race more because to be completely honest, this class so far has furthered my thinking about other races and i feel like i am more comfortable already talking about race.
He also has a philosophy background so thats what he uses to motivate his stance.
That was wrong of people to do but I dont think its any reason to not use social media as much anymore in class.
If you visit any other place in the world, a lot of people there will not be as open to talk about race and race issues since they don't have much experience with dealing with people of different backgrounds and cultures.
This is a remarkable example of biology directly influencing our psychology and opinion.
He has been all over the world, and Im looking forward to hearing what other experiences he had in foreign countries.
I agree once again with your response, social media really opens doors in Sociology 119.
One of the volunteers in class discussed how Kenyans had better cardiovascular endurance than other races.
I also believe people from the US are very unaware that there is racism in other parts of the world which is why Sam brought this up.
It's very interesting to know that both parties involved feel this way, and it really made me wonder if the government should be fighting wars like this and altering the courses of millions of lives over what seems to be very poor reasoning.
And they aren't wrong, they are just looking for the attention of people who refuse to listen.
Why is it that the African American culture is so underrepresented in the culture of Greek life?
This goes to show how people have moved all over the world from where their ancestors were originally from.
I think that what Brian said was very important because he gives historical evidence as to why people still see race as a major component in American society.
I like how Sam ends this video, discussing Indias caste system by describing their ladder of power between people and Columbias similar viewpoint on racial topics being discussed too much.
Personally, I think that dating outside your race is a great way to immerse yourself into different cultures, which helps a lot with understanding people from different backgrounds.
If you are white and walk into a black neighborhood they are going to look at you as if they are better than you and that you don't belong here.
Politicians may portray certain ethnicities as them, showing that they are ready to protect us.
This country was founded and built by immigrants.
There is inherently a race issue no matter where you are in the world, however, America just tends to speak about it more for many reasons.
The part of lecture Matching Ancestor Groups was something I could personally relate to.
I totally agree with this, I also felt a little uncomfortable at those points too but I liked that no one seemed to be upset about it.
Everyone knows what a racist is and what a racist believes, right?
Appearances and external features have nothing to do with who we are as people, just simply where our ancestors are from geographically.
I grew up in Philadelphia, surrounded by a mix of black and white kids growing up.
We learned about Christopher Columbus, etc, but never were given gruesome details about wiping them out.
I was able to experience this myself.
I received these types of questions the older I got, especially when I started college.
Sam was correct when he said that we've never gotten past some of the racial issues of the Civil Rights era and before.
I found this really interesting as well and started to wonder what little traits relate back to my ancestry.
I personally have learned so much more through this class and talking to people who have been affected by this issue than through any of my previous years in school.
I did my post on the same video, and had a similar viewpoint.
On one hand, it shows that we as a country are very diverse and from different areas around the world.
It is a shame because it causes all of this separation just because we look, talk, or think different.
I always thought People should admit that slavery was a complete atrocity that really only happened because it could, not because one race was actually better than the other.
I like how Sam points out how distinct physical features can differentiate one ancestry from the next but reminds everyone that regardless of these appearances or backgrounds, were all the same.
In my discussion group we have talked a lot about race and the question, Is everyone a little racist?
While reading this response to the discussion, I began to find that I agreed with every single point written.
The other student was much shorter and had a longer torso.
My moms whole side of the family is pure bred Italian.
The civil rights movement made racism a big deal but its good it did since people were and are still speaking out about racism in this country.
The topic that I found to be the most interesting involved sports being inherently racist.
I also believe that people tend to be attracted to certain types of people, and that they don't intentionally exclude a certain race from their dating habits.
Racism is not super obvious in my family- I do not have an uncle who spews racial slurs or says politically incorrect (for lack of a better term) statements over Christmas dinner.
Its new to hear it from a sociology background.
For the longest time I thought that was just kind of a white people thing that we had a hard time telling the difference between people from different asian countries.
I believe that is where the United States currently is at.
If we talked less about tragedies and worked harder to educate one another and voice our opinions in a more respectful manner, we would be able to reach solutions much faster and easier.
Since it's a lot cheaper to play basketball than it is to play hockey, maybe the case is about where families stand economically and in our minds as a society, I think people generally believe African Americans make up a lot of the lower class.
Do I think that certain traits are acquired through ones environment or genetics?
Sam then raised another interesting point that race seems like a bigger issue in the United States than in other countries because of how much we talk about.
Us, as a young generation, seeing that was a wake up call to all of us that we are all just people struggling to do well in college and to become successful in the future.
I never fully grasped how big of a deal racism is until I got older and started to see just how discriminating and barbarous people can be.
Some members of my family consider themselves to be very religious so I have been around people like this my whole life.
I also thought it was interesting when Sam was talking about the notorious racist Italian grandparents.
I think all cultures are interesting and I love learning about where people are from.
I really liked listening to this topic because I don't think many of us really understood why some sports are dominated by a certain race.
These genetics are would give advantages athletically to it comes things such as the Olympics.
What is the history in United States that made race such a big deal?
Maybe it also depends on the person but sometimes introducing your race and culture to a person can be a hit or miss, some people just aren't interested in learning or find our traditions odd (I've dealt with that before).
I was taught that history didnt remember anyone who looked like me, so I assumed they didnt exist.
I however do not agree with the violence it has brought about and I do believe that is doing nothing more than creating bigger problems for our country.
The fact that the discovery of America is still celebrated absolutely baffles me.
I agree that the media does play a role in giving you these false interpretations of other countries.
Sports had always been a love of mine so much that I hadn't really every considered them racist, they are too pure.
Unfortunately, I grew up in an area in Bucks County, PA where about 90% of the students at my high school were white.
There is no one single Latino look.
I think that is an important question to ask.
The media does not represent the world accurately at all!
That is universal and not from a particular race, however some people see it that way.
With the question being if we speak about race too much really depends on how it's spoken about.
There wasnt any huge significance but it was noticeable, and even more so when I turned on the TV and watched professional sports games.
People never talk about race, but I feel that there are many high class people that feel a strange tension when they are talking with people of different social statuses.
That is why traveling can give you that view that what you once saw is not the same as when you are experiencing or seeing it in your own eyes.
We are all people and it is important to learn that early and often.
I always wondered why that was.
As an immigrant in my community, it just made me wonder which one of my neighbors had disliked me and my family this whole time.
When asked to find a difference between the two, you could tell in their eyes that they were thinking very hard about it.
Another factor playing into all of this is that the United States is one of the most diverse countries in the world.
In America, there are vast amounts of Brown, Asian, Black, White, Native American and any other race, which causes people to notice difference more and talk about it.
That is what they know from a young age.
Human beings are beautiful creatures, and I think it is high time we start accepting people for who they are and become more aware of the implications we make when we as society group people together by skin color because that is not what should define us.
I also believe that everyone is created equal no matter what race, gender, ethnicity, etc.
Watching him point out small things such as an eye fold that someone has was intriguing.
How can we move on as a country when we still are supporting racism in so many ways such as these historical monuments?
I never really noticed it until Dr. Sam pointed it out.
It is important to expose yourself to other cultures so that you as an individual in society can grow as a human being, and not be ignorant to the world around you.
Using a sociological lens to take a closer look at this, it's interesting that we're always noticing these things, often subliminally, and yet no one likes to start these conversations.
Basketball was and still is a very big game in the south where a larger portion of african american families live.
I believe over 65 languages were spoken at my high school.
Part of the problem with racism is that fact that people get misinformation and create these stereotypes.
While it istrue the United States has progressed tremendously, racein itself is prevailing in our daily lives.
It takes a lot of courage to get up in front of such a big classroom like Thomas, and speak your opinion on these controversial topics.
If I am being honest, I am not really sure what an Armenian person looks like besides the Kardashians and I really hope I do not look anything similar to them.
Being encouraged to look carefully at each others features for clues to our ancestry groups is intriguing, even though it was clear from the activity that with mixed ancestry in particular it isnt that straightforward.
However, I think the United States is different from India, Venezuela and Colombia because we are more of a racial melting pot than those countries.
There could be plenty of explanations for this topic, but this is what I believe based on my experience playing different sports.
Using the U.S. for example was a really strong argument because the media does make the U.S. look like a rich and powerful country.
Race has always been a difficult topic to discuss and it has not gotten any easier.
It's always crazy to me because I never picked up on it but whenever anyone new meets my mom they can immediately tell she was brought up in the South, even though she spent the majority of her life elsewhere!
I thought it was amazing to have a real person visit from Afghanistan and see that he has embraced the western culture.
When you live there your whole life, it is very easy to become ignorant of the hate that goes on around you I think.
I believe that people looking different creates a greater sociological divide in American society which causes a greater debate about race.
I mean the foundations of the educational system were laid in Chicago in the late eighteen hundred to mainly produce factory workers due to the social and economic conditions of that era.
I think nowadays people are too scared to talk about race because they do not want to be viewed as a bad or offensive person by saying the wrong thing because what one person may find offensive another person may not at all.
Perhaps however one of the most important arguments, is that something can never be talked about too much.
What should be brought up is the reason that the protests are happening in the first place.
Another major barrier that causes groups to be less advanced is to be a woman.
I resonated with the students in the video on the far right because I believe they were grouped together because they looked white.
Why it is that Jamaica produces the best runners in the world?
Not only did they initiallyface wars, massacre, slavery, forced displacement,the imposition of treaties,etc., but they still remain one of the most underrepresented, unrecognized and discriminatedcommunitieswithin U.S.society.
You would think this diversity would lead to a more accepting youth which produces more accepting adults.
I grew up in Northern Jersey and never necessarily noticed anyone having an accent.
I am sure the nose and eyebrows as discussed in the video will begin to change even more so as more and more ethnic generations begin to blend together.
I find it a little embarrassing that I was unable to distinguish the person from China versus the people from Siberia.
Putting ourselves in each others shoes and understanding the reason behind everyones views and opinions and actions is the only way to truly make progress, because at the end of the day, we are all human.
I have always struggled to differentiate Koreans, Chinese, and Japanese people from each other.
I think the alt right people see the external physical differences between white people and other groups which leads them to their conclusion that white people have specific genes which make them the best and on top of every other group of people.
I hope that in my lifetime I will be able to see equality for all but unfortunately our world will have this problem for a long time.
Since it is a difficult topic to discuss, the outcomes of these discussions have lead to many riots.
However, I would not be surprised if in 500 years (if humanity still exists), that we figure out the ins and outs to everything in the universe and figure out all of the universe's secrets and realize that everything in our universe happened by pure chance.
She said that in her experience, Americans cant tell Koreans apart.
Race is considered a really touchy subject and I agree that there needs to be more open communication between races.
Silence holds us back from revolutionizing and evolving into a better society as a whole, so the conversation is important.
Like I said before, no one is born racist.
His point of view is just a broader but simpler, wiser and experienced point of view than any other Ive heard in this kind of topics.
I remember learning that religion and science can both coexist.
I really like what Sam had to say about this topic.
People forget that Americans are still struggling, even now after hurricane Harvey that devastated Texas.
It honestly also made me feel pretty ignorant.
A major flaw with the media is they influence our perceptions of other countries based on what they report.
I believe that technology is somehow making us more aware and connected and the almost infinite access to information dissolved all of the boundaries that stopped us from learning.
The issue with track and field now comes along and we have to be quite honest.
Race is both an issue on a large and small scale, whether it be the hate rallies that take place in our very own country, or the way we ourselves can judge people in certain situations in our everyday lives.
I believe now thats because of the media.
Some people I know had to go through another program to play hockey, which most likely costs money.
In my opinion, it makes the most sense that God guided the process of human evolution.
Our lacrosse team was predominantly white with very few players who were black.
But people tend to forget that we have extremely poor communities still in this country.
Sam wrapped up this particular video with this quote, which I think shows the shear absurdity of some of the basic reasons given for why certain cultural groups excel at certain sports.
Hurricane Irma is currently making landfall.
I immediately thought that I could see how myopic individuals may have been brought to that conclusion, but it was not one of my own.
And I think the array of photos showing the people of America is very profound as well.
Yes there are racial discriminations, but they seem very trivial and less aggressive than the ones that take place throughout different parts of the United States.
I have witnessed some racism even within my own family with my grandparents being extremely racist to black people specifically.
For example if someone was pulled over for speeding or doing something wrong and said to an officer: did you only pull me over because I am (whatever race)?
Travel the world really resonated with me.
You never truly can understand how others are living until you see it for yourself.
I really like the quote you pulled from Samuel Richards.
I think that there are a lot of factors that were mentioned in class that have to do with race and sports.
For example, women are paid less in this country.
We should be taught more about the way it has really affected the diverse country we live in and how it still does today.
I believe that racism is significantly more relevant in the South.
Rafael Leonidas Trujillo, ruled for 30 consecutive years, and is guilty for the murder of thousands of Haitians and Black Dominicans, in his efforts to refine or cleanse the breed.
This racial barrier that we have seen so much in the past has really been broken and now there are marriages between people of nations that would have never happened in the past or even been frowned upon.
But this seems to be such an inherently (American?
I liked that the idea of respect to be respected, but I think that we must be proud of our difference proud of our ancestries and traditions.
I dropped one course my first semester, then another my second semester and also took an F in a core course.
I really couldn't agree with you or Sam more.
For me, I could tell where some of them were from largely by continent, and from that I realized that I really do not know a lot about the people that I see every day.
At least I now know that my thoughts were not completely wrong.
Personally, I think we talk about race too much but not in the right context.
From their noses, head shapes, skin color, just as professor Richards said, if you look closer and you know the difference between the areas, then you will be able to tell where someone is from.
The whites slaughtered millions in Africa and also continuously destabilize regions like the middle east which in turn reduces the chances of innovation and success because people are brought up to a world where all they see is blood and violence.
We have no control over the things of the past and we should start trying to move forward and work on the things that are in the here and now.
This topic caught my attention for multiple reasons, but the two biggest were the fact that I follow sports religiously and because I grew up playing lacrosse and football.
I found your post to be very interesting in the fact that I agree with it!
My point of view on this topic is quite similar to what Sam is talking about during this discussion.
Even though we are not the only country having these problems, being able to speak about it allows those who feel cornered to share how they are feeling.
Im sure its pretty nuanced how all this stuff works, but it doesnt make it any less frustrating.
Educating people about why facial structures can be so different is essential and I believe could lead to less racial tensions.
Black culture is surrounded by basketball and football.
We need an educational system that generates awe and curiosity into the students rather than killing that curiosity and creativity.
I feel like I dont know anything about most countries besides what I hear about in the media and this is such a massive issue today!
The video begins with the topic of why a huge majority of NHL players are white and why a huge portions of NBA players are african american.
There are no reasonable excuses to not learn about anything that makes us passionate nowadays, especially with the free access of information and available resources in both the digital and physical world.
There are plenty of blacks who are a part of the middle and higher socioeconomic classes, but that has not always been the case in our country.
I agree with your comment that this activity was meant to bring us together.
The biggest difference like you said is within the style of clothes.
I think its invasive because having someone in your face and see what might appear to them as flaws because they might not look the same as you and may not be familiar with your facial features while if someone is the same race were examining your facial features you may be more comfortable because we would have more in common and its relatable.
If they are European would they look like an Asian or a European?
The similarity between each picture was amazing; my partner and I never got one correct.
I can't completely explain why these race differences exist within lacrosse, but I believe it is linked to culture and socioeconomic statuses.
Probably one of my biggest step out of your comfort zone experiences I've had in life so far.
The only thing we can do to truly grasp the concept is to combine studies that have already been done with what is said in the bible.
It is really hurtful to our youth and society as we try to branch away from the racism and hate that affects our country.
These white supremacists argue that they are superior due to their success and achievements.
My mom grew up in San Antonio TX, but moved out when she was 17.
However, sports do not care about the color of one's skin.
Dr. Sam kept stressing about the fact that white supremacists believe that people from other races are not as fully developed/capable as the whites.
I really liked your story when you said people are just as happy, if not happier than people in the United States, living in Thailand where showers are cold, toilets are in the ground and bamboo has to be cut down for cooking fuel.
They tend to like their own people that are similar or identical if they wish to them.
However they had motivation and dedication to put themselves to the gym and work hard on their bodies.
For example, if you were to walk into the cafeteria during lunch, you would see a table of Asian, a table of Indian, a table of blacks, and the rest filled with a sea of white people.
I truly believe that America is on a path to a much more accepting culture, and I look forward to the day where instances such as the Charlottesville tragedy, never take place again.
And with that I believe that the more culture you learn from the better understanding you can have about life and the world we live in.
Race continues to be brought to attention more and more.
Just like Sam was saying, afro style hair helps keep the scalp covered from over exposure to the sun, and pale skin means the skin absorbs sun faster than darker skin due to the sun exposure of different places in the world.
I also think that you make a really good point.
Sam tells us the closer to the equator a person lives, the darker the skin, due to the amount of direct sunlight that a person will be exposed to.
I completely agree that race needs to be more of a common-place topic where people on both sides can be more open and accepting about race.
I did not know that the external differences between humans is a fairly recent shift and I found that very fascinating.
Skin color should not determine who people are.
As touched upon in class, we said that mostly white men play hockey.
During Sams discussion, he mentioned that some sports have only recently become available in all areas of the world, like for example ice hockey.
I found the international students to be much more soft spoken, and they dressed much differently than the American students, almost neater and well kept.
To me, that sounds like a really positive and productive way to get past a problem that was plaguing a country.
This is what never allows all groups of a race to come to an accepting and understanding state.
The voice tells you so many things about a person, maybe where they are from, where they have spent lengthy periods of time, their general age, and even sometimes the social class that they belong to.
Every one of us is an illustration of the past, a beautiful thing to think about.
Still though, I worry about all the conflict that can cause from this sort of mindset that a lot of communities seem to exhibit.
One of the big ways racism is discussed is in the news and on social media.
It is truly fascinating to think how in the future, the majority of people will be of all different kinds of ethnicities and cultures.
Rather, it is upon the individual; how hard the individual trains, how many hours they put in the gym.
You assume they are all white like americans but as you look closely you will find these distinctive features and details that are different compared to your people.
A lot of the players in the NBA did not come from the best parts of the country or even world.
I agree with most of what Matthew said in his post.
After a long day of grueling work, they come home to their families, the children go to school and some may even go to college.
Almost every day that you check the media there is some type of headline involving a cop abusing their power and theres a very high chance that it was involving an African American.
Just last week at work I heard a little boy say something to a little girl that made me think.
Just the fact that people from other countries feel it's necessary to come up with a more American name shows that we don't really appreciate how hard it is to come to America.
I love hockey and got excited seeing the players on the screen and was ready for good discussion.
Maybe the entity created the many universes that could have collided to form our universe, which is a current theory.
It's sad to think that my grandparents grew up thinking that white people are much superior than any other race or religious type.
This means that being called uneducated goes from being an insult to a sad reality.
Granted, a lot of the African community here at PSU has been very friendly and open to me, but I know its not the same everywhere in the United States.
Like Sam said, I think religion is great and a necessary part of most people's lives.
But he is a great example of what real people are like.
Before this lecture, I also did not know that peoples different features were culturally adapted over time.
I can also attest to your observation of people dating people who resemble their family or even themselves as I have seen this first hand many times.
I think people fail to realize Latin America is just a big cluster of diverse looking people.
I can't say that i have never experienced racism in my life.
When thinking about the amount of children that go to bed hungry every night in America, it doesn't seem like something that would actually happen but we just have to see the world in a different light.
The same cruel intention to cleanse the race that enslaved our society for years, is still one that simply hasn't gone away.
The Matching Ancestor activity reminded me of a discussion I had with one of my friends in high school.
Another reason I think that we talk about race too much is because there are no true leaders per se of the races.
There are no terms to necessarily be negotiated, because under the law in the United States all U.S. citizens are equal.
Finally, I love what you said about the Americanized names international students use.
So that can eliminate the argument that black people have better hops or white guys are better adapted to play in the cold.
Therefore, every race is equally evolved.
These are generalizations but black culture and white culture are different.
it requires all sorts of equipment and isn't always accessible at public schools.
I pointed her out immediately and Brittany was surprised.
I always thought that made us such an interesting group to look at.
Women dont get enough opportunity to be advanced.
In other words, everything points to the fact that humans are all going to evolve differently, depending on their environment.
Slavery was abolished, and the Civil War led to the recognition of African American citizenship and voting rights (with some exceptions).
The video and topic I chose to respond to was regarding race and if we talk about it too much.
I would have never thought of it that way ifprofessor Richards didn't phrasedit like that.
By contrast, I felt like school was actually killing my curiosity.
I believe the more we speak up the better it is.
I couldn't agree more about your input about that video.
In addition, the weather plays a big role in this also because it needs to be in cold temperatures to play the game or else you will not have ice to skate on.
Hockey is one of the most expensive sports to play due to all of the equipment.
This would help in basketball because this sport requires running and passing.
This notion that genes are the only reason why certain races of people are good at a sport is false.
He does this to show that white people are the most advanced and that they have the most privilege.
I think if everyone had a clean slate and kept an open mind we would all be able to understand each other and instead of discriminating or being scared to talk about it.
I always just thought that race relations were a universal problem on the same level it is here in America, but after listening to all the peoples different thoughts from there different backgrounds it became apparent to me that though race is an issue everywhere yet it does seem to be much more of an issue in America.
Unlike, other countries who have race problems as well, I think ours has been pushed to the main stage of news outlets and become a priority in many peoples lives because a voice has been given to those oppressed such as the in civil rights movement, and the black lives matter movement.
Ideally, everyone should be equal in all aspects of life, but until that is reality, some issues need to be dealt with differently because of race.
Other than this problem, I only see the good that can come out of using social media in class.
I think race needs to be talked about.
You said being racist is not something we are born with but rather something we learn over time.
I saw a video recently, where someone asked different pairs of kids to find a difference between themselves.
We don't have to ignore what is happening because by ignoring this kind of problem you're not going anywhere.
I agree that one ethnicity of people is not more evolved or better than others.
The reason why there is so much frustration with these law enforcement cases is because the United States government has never done acknowledged or punished the cops who abused their power.
Not talking about the issue is not going to solve it.
When I had the choice to pick between the two I chose basketball because it so much easier to get ready play.
Overall, I completely agree with your post and how all individuals of any race should have the freedom to play any sport.
It's incredible how society has advanced through the years but we haven't been able to solve all these racism problems.
The Evolution Theory is a really tough concept to get your head around because no one is 100% sure what happened.
As I got older, I noticed a difference in the sports I, a white girl, would play compared to my black friends.
I don't think Jeffton had any idea they were actually Latino, he just happen to get lucky.
It is important for us as a society to stop segregating ourselves because we may never understand the views of people who are not like us unless we do.
Canada and Russia are places that are typically cold and icy, where whites adapt better to in the cold and blacks do not work well in the cold because we need to live closer to the equator in order to support our melanin.
If you compare his body to the average white man, he most likely has quite a few inches over them being 6 feet and 5 inches.
I agree exactly with what you said.
Even though Theistic Revolution is what the majority of people believe in, one cannot say that it is the correct form ofevolution.
I think understanding the idea of mixed is the greatest objective.
However, I believe that every race is equally evolved also.
I guess that can be attributed to a sense of pride also.
As far as your question about if Sam's comments are crossing the racism line - I don't think he crosses it.
And with the collective minorities set to pass whites as the majority in early 2040 I think you will see America shift into a more equal society everyday.
When the question of accents was brought up in class, I was immediately intrigued.
This activity really opened my eyes and it seemed to have done the same for you.
When Lieutenant Colonel Garey talked about what shocked him the most about Afghanistan it was really cool to see they shared the same interpretations of what I had of the country as well.
For one, India was fighting between two main large groups of people.
I also agree with you with your take on what happened in the Hayden situation.
Its important to recognize these individuals because they shatter all of the explanations we think we have.
I'd like to quote a DJ i like.
Racism is socially present because people put too much of an emphasis on so called differences, when in reality the only difference between people of different races is skin color.
I feel that Sam really wanted to express this by specifically choosing people of mixed backgrounds but also further expand on it by including some students who were still of only one background.
Also, I think that when people make these bold generalizations its just the fact that they may have a lack of knowledge as a result of where they are from and raised but is something that people should be taught not to do until they spend time learning other cultures and doing their research.
I didnt understand that they have some similar issue we go through as well.
I think that people who are white supremacists have been taught to see a very specific way.
I do think that sports is a very cultural idea and is why we see the difference in color in the two sports.
I come from a similar situation being fully Indian.
I would dare to say that that schools and universities need a reformation at the core of its system.
Later in the lecture, Professor Richards said that its very important that we note the differences in people from different countries, despite being of the same race.
Traveling to foreign countries opens your eyes to so many things.
even though theres more to it, I just do not know enough about Africa and all of the countries in it to ask more in depth questions.
I found that to be really interesting.
It is perplexing to even think bout what goes on in the minds of theseAlt-Right people.
Take slavery for example, for me I feel as if the US has not taken responsibility for their actions but instead, has looked at slavery as being a dark part of our history that we should forget and move on from.
We group others on the way they look when in reality they have may have little to no relation at all.
I may have not noticed because I am white but I also never really thought about that picture as a race issue and that it portrays that white people are superior to colored people.
A southern accent can sometimes be mistaken for ignorance, but it really is just a reflection of the immigrants who first came to the United States.
As sam was saying in class, all humans are 99.7% the same but these alt right beliefs are still active in today's society.
I believed it was sociology.
If generations ago a group of Asians moved over to Europe then their descendants lived in Europe for hundreds of years would they be Asians or Europeans?
Other than that I do believe it is completely cultural.
When Sam discusses the two volunteers physical appearance in the video, I cant help but to think of how amazing it is that the traits we carry around today, are the same traits of our ancestors.
However, hockey is a very expensive sport to play.
We were having snack and she threw away a perfectly good yogurt because she didn't want it, all she did was open it and smell it.
No matter what your skin color is, some people are cruel and do terrible things.
Overall I thought the exercise was pretty eye opening for everyone in the class.
Spreading hatred about one race or other causes riots to break out.
Some will argue that is a human nature to conclude that their own people are better than some, or they feel more comfortable among who are alike to them.
I found this to be an extremely interesting topic as well!
When I told the person next to me I was actually Latina, he responded, wow, but you don't look latino, a response I get often.
I agree with you that race is talked about too much in a negative light.
Therefore, we need to embrace the fact we are the same and stop the racism, and the thought of one race being better than the rest.
When people try to guess what I am, nine times out of ten they are wrong and also usually way off.
Sam then went into a rather confusing talk about the Siberians coming over to America and how the Native Americans and Siberians look so similar.
The important thing is for all of us to keep an open mind to the many possibilities that the world has to offer.
This is a huge problem because the media has such a big influence on people.
Silence means people are afraid to talk about whats bothering them.
Every evolution theory makes sense in its own ways and one person cannot claim one is right and the other is wrong, and if one claims that there is only one correct evolution theory then they are ignorant.
Shorter torso and longer legs allow people to run faster.
But I do think we are on a positive path.
It is insane to think about not even knowing how many native american tribes are present in the US and how that information is never presented to us in high school.
I feel as though our society today finds it easier to consider sports inherently racist simply because they don't go deeper into what is actually racist about it.
The vast majority of people in power in Panama are white while most of the people doing low class jobs are brown people.
Although there are many different religious and ethnic groups in India, people there tend to look the same brown.
I agree with the video that the United States has never come to terms with the fact that this country was built on racism.
I think that problem can be solved relatively easily just by our fellow classmates having respect for one another.
Overall, I think its important to remember the many white individuals who excel at football and basketball.
Those are the only two obvious explanations to me because the sport can be played in all areas of the world and people of all races are able to train their bodies to play the sport.
I think racism is something that you are taught from a young age.
I feel as though this lecture was interesting too and truly opened my eyes on how we view the way people look and the ways we initially categorize them.
For example, basketball is a much cheaper sport to play.
That is evident in today's society with different hate groups spawning throughout the world.
However, one of the biggest factors of that goes hand in hand with sports is economic status.
Anybody of any race should be able to play any sport without it being considered unordinary.
Topics, such as the criminal justice system, that on their surface dont seem to involve race sometimes affect minority groups in ways that are different from how they affect white people.
Only 67% of Native students become high school graduates, which is well below the nationalaverage.
They excelled at different sports based on where their physical and evolutionary strengths exceeded.
I have seen that photo of evolution many times and I never thought about the fact that the person in front is a white guy.
These traits can be seen in athletes of all races and that is why I believe lacrosse will diversify as a sport.
I really like how Sam explained it in class about how they consider themselves to be a superior race and how they truly believe that other races are incapable and underdeveloped.
When we were first getting to know each other, we went to the mall and met up with her sister who was there with several other Korean international students.
There is an answer for both statements, if we are either talking too much about or not talking about the subject at all.
I do not personally know if it is the same in other Latin American countries but it probably is.
Poverty doesn't mean everything.
Overtime America made some efforts to right the wrongs of our past but it hasnt been good enough.
The video was mostly about perspective that we have of certain places in this world.
It always seemed like everyone got along, no matter the color of your skin or the religion you practiced.
I cannot deny that there are sports like Hockey, Basketball, and Lacrosse that have a higher majority of one race than other sports.
We must talk about it and seek solutions or else we are bound to repeat our past and race will continue to be big issue.
A point in the video I would like to discuss was when the war on drugs was brought up.
I believe that sports is not racist rather people have made the idea ancestry and genetics play the biggest role.
I still had plenty of friends of other races but I wonder why people of different races almost segregate themselves into groups.
Lacrosse is similar to hockey in that it is predominantly played by white guys and I believe this is due to cultural differences.
They work really hard to show you hospitality where you dont expect it.
I mean even if you look at images from the Hubble telescope thanks to our technological advancements, you get a sense of awe and transcendence that completely changes the way you think.
I especially thought the girl whose parents met in State college is incredible.
Where do the other races play into that evolution?
I feel like you'll always be able to tell for the most part that someone is like, Asian or of African decent, but you can't always say the same for Latinos.
I remembered feeling so angry about it because it obviously was.
So for them to learn about the differences in African Americans we would have to point them out.
I agree with Kiley about how people from different economic, political, and racial backgrounds all have the same thing in common; to try to make their group seem better.
However, I think there are other indirect and subtler issues that should involve race when being discussed.
Sure it has taken like three or four lectures to get it done, but I think most of the people in the lecture are already influenced about what Professor Richards has said.
If you take hockey for example, the majority of NHL players are white and there is no secret that the best hockey players come from places like Canada or Russia.
We are all human beings, so who is this group of people to dehumanize others, or make them feel lesser than.
Hiding behind an online keyboard is very simple but debating inflammatory points of view could be challenging and I think that with the implementation of social media we can hopefully generate an atmosphere of learning about all different points of view while maintaining civility whether we agree or disagree on any issue.
On the other side, african americans are more likely to gravitate towards playing basketball because that was something you could play anywhere at any time of the year.
Why is it that the NHL is dominated by people with white skin?
My hometown is a predominately white town and drug use has always been an issue there.
In the United States, hate crimes are very common, and police brutality is a very recurrent (but also avoided) topic.
These issues and problems also come from speakers who place one race on top of another race.
Personally, I really do not understand why racism is such a huge problem in the United States.
Whenever I think of the world poor, starving or something along those lines my mind automatically goesto Africa or somewhere in the middle east where there are many children who are starving.
I do not think though that people should feel guilty for the things that their ancestors did.
Throughout school, we have always been taught about slavery and the different aspects of it but we truly never addressed the issue at hand.
Hockey is one of the most expensive sports to play growing up.
In the previous discussion group, this issue came up and one of the students said that we should ignore race as we all equal and interact with each other based on the conduct and manners we have.
If this remains the case it will be hard for lower socioeconomic groups to play the sport.
Meeting people who are different from us is essential; it makes the world a more knowledgeable and inclusive place.
Some of us might look at a homeless black man and think well, he brought this on himself.
I think a lot of black children are denied the opportunity to play hockey, whereas all you need to play basketball is a ball and a hoop nailed to a post.
In a song he says, before revolution can start in the streets, it first has to happen in the mind.
Whenever I meet someone from Africa I just say thats cool!
We must raise our children and future generation to avoid noticing a difference between Skylar and the other two lovely women.
As a personal example, I know that things are kind of strained between American blacks and Africans due to lack of knowledge on Africa in this country from Americans and overall a lot of misunderstandings between the two groups.
I would like to know if there are any instances of racism in India today?
So far this class has taught me that our physical traits is a special story of our ancestry, one that should be cherished.
I agree with some of the statements you have made in your response.
No matter your political beliefs, I believe there was no justification in electing someone who could potentially hurt people you care about with their decisions.
School shootings, and church shootings are also unheard of in Puerto Rico, and hearing about all these different hate acts shocked me tremendously.
I think it is not talked about enough, and this class should be a class in every high school.
You make a good point about our country coming together.
But how else could it be explained that the majority of basketball players, short distance runners, high jumpers, and football players are black?
Like you said, your dad loves football and you grew up watching the New York Giants, so obviously you're going to have a strong love for the game and most likely the strive to play football.
Unfortunately, if someone were to live in a poor area, they wouldn't be able to have the access to all the equipment and extra money that goes into hockey.
Still this I see this applied in society today, people are always guessing someone's nationality and while sometimes they guess correctly, many times the answer could be shocking.
Looking back at the lecture, I was just as astonished about the fully developed human being, and how that in almost all figures the standing straight up human was white.
I do not agree that race should be put in the same category as religion and politics.
Personally, I do not think sports are inherently racist.
I think that it does almost seem like our society has caused it to be disrespectful to talk about someones race or ethnicity, when in fact we should be learning about it more, as Sam stated.
This not only tears a nation apart but it also restricts it from progressing.
Before coming here, I never really saw myself (primarily) as a minority, and whenever I met people, I would never immediately think about their skin color and how that plays a major role for them in society.
This is the same thing that happened with basketball.
The players that come out of the USA are predominately from colder states that are up north including New York, Minnesota, Michigan, and Boston.
Most of the players who play in the NHL today are from either foreign countries, Canada or the United States.
A key explanation for high level athleticism prevalently found in black people is an acclimation of their black ancestors used to adapt to their geographic location.
The examples he uses are just phenomenal and I really enjoyed this topic in particular.
Education is absolutely the first step to get away from the ignorance that is way too prevalent in the United States.
Yes alt right people do have a very strong opinion and could be narrow minded in the ways they think about human evolution, and they surely do exist.
I think the majority of the US people don't really travel and their view is just stuck in one place and they have negative views about a country and don't really want to learn about other countries in general.
I believe and agree with the Every Life Matters Movement.
I dont believe that the typical buildup of some races is superior to other races.
When he said its like people from Peru have something in common with us in Pennsylvania.
It is easy spot differences between yourself and other people without giving it another second to ask yourself why.
I am speaking on personal experience here however.
I find that most millennials are very open to all races and dont discriminate other, there obviously are certain oddballs out there that share different views.
and even amongst blacks along those categories (whose the blackest, who isnt, whatever) and its so frustrating, because there are a lot of things that we are dealing with at the same time and it feels pointless to try to make us feel better than other people in our own communities.
It is true that many people tend to stay in on place in their whole life and never explore different thing outside their community.
Never would I have thought would there ever be any discrimination present in my community.
Whereas that is not the case, if we travel the world, broaden our perspective we wouldn't be caught up of just believing what we are given by the media.
The sport will begin to become a part of many cultures, but I believe it will stay within higher socioeconomic status groups because of the cost of equipment and other costs associated with the sport.
However, I am not sure if I believe that an action like that can help out the problem in America.
However, whichever race was put at the end of the spectrum still would have gotten scrutiny for the same reason the original picture got scrutiny.
However, I think we need to talk about race in better places than the current status quo is.
Recently in America, the actions of the racists in Charlottesville have made it seem like our country has taken a few steps backward, even if that is not the case.
Growing up in Ethiopia and speaking three languages helped me see the world differently, it is not a one sided view.
So by him openly talking about these things, some people aren't used to hearing it.
Everything Sam said made complete sense.
Our views of the world around us are formed based on others perspectives.
Just because it's all we see in the news doesn't mean you have to ignore it.
I appreciated the theories that were presented however.
When they asked about the point of this activity, I said something like, I think it was to show that people aren't that different.
I was surprised when I guessed incorrectly but then realized that it was just straight up hard to differentiate.
As I got older and began to learn more about evolution and the differences between what God says about creation compared to what science says, my views started to shift more towards believing in Theistic Revolution.
Today, it is safe to say that white privilege is alive and well as we have a president who scored a victory not by popular vote, but thanks to the electoral system which was (and is still) rooted on those inequality precepts.
However, the idea of Accepting and Understanding one another will never be achieved in my opinion.
For instance, Dominicans experienced one of the most brutal dictatorships the American continent has ever seen.
For the most part, the media focuses on negative problems that are happening all around the world.
I think that in specific aspects of life in America, certain races are not treated equal.
Their skin color has evolved to help them survive in their location.
In the end, the student was surprisingly pretty successful at grouping the students together but the one detail that really either helped him or killed him was that many of the students chosen to be examples had mixed ancestries.
It is very easy to see an entire race in the same light, but extremely unfair at the same time.
This act is not exclusive to the U.S it keeps happening in everyplace around the world.
Hateful comments can come out of it and that is exactly what we see all the time.
Although there may not be racism, I do find that there is segregation.
I thought I would never assume that someones misfortunes or skills were a result of race and their own biological make up!
As we started to look at the different pictures of people who looked very similar, it was clear that everyone in the class had different opinions on where each person was from.
There is nothing wrong with being prideful in ones beliefs, but promoting ones beliefs can be done in a better manner.
My dad always says that every person you meet came from a long unbroken line of survivors - meaning that all of our ancestors were able to overcome every natural and manmade disaster that the world has gone through, from the Ice Age to the Black Plague, since the beginning of time.
That really opened my eyes to the fact that even though we always place people under certain labels in our minds, they arent always correct.
I agree with Sam that people who make such a bold statement to say that the separation between white people and other people is so distinct just shows their ignorance and lack of knowledge about our DNA.
You could have given it to me, there are children starving in Africa!
Whenever Sam brought this up in class I was taken aback a bit because I never really though about third world countries in that light.
In college, the story was sort of similar, a big percentage of my classes and professors were uninspiring and they generated a banal environment for learning.
Shawn, The video you picked is definitely one with a lot of controversy around it.
Due to this, people like athletes resort to their own ways to protest and talk about race.
They show images of malls that were bombed and make it seem like a very poor country.
I hope that maybe Sam could elaborate on what I am trying to say as a class topic someday.
This is striking because we all may look so different but we are created the same way, our bones, vessels, DNA.
I became friends with Brittany, who came to the U.S. from South Korea for high school and college.
I definitely agree with the fact that white people believe that due to just how much the whites had power over all the other races.
Most african Americans will be seen to live in southern, warmer states such as Florida, Georgia, and Louisiana where basketball and football are played more often.
If one group is constantly being controlled or harassed by another proves the point that we do not speak about it enough.
In order to truly immerse your self in different cultures, travel is key.
I do not think it makes much sense to say that white people have better genes than any other group of people when all humans are genetically almost the same to each other.
There is no way for them to prove that they are more evolved than any other group of people.
In conclusion, I believe the reason more white people play hockey and more african americans play basketball is because of differences in cultural locations with slight economic reasons.
I also played many sports growing up.
I also believe that it does have to do with finances.
I truly feel this is very unjust and racist of our country/president.
I remember from one of the earlier classes this semester Sam said something like we are 99.9 precent the same, DNA wise.
The boy said sarcastically: why did you throw it out!
Its really cool to see how different parts of the country have their own colloquial slang.
On the other hand, I completely understand that race does need to be discussed to bring to light the racial injustices that go on in the country, but if racism wasn't such a huge issue in our country we would not have to discuss it.
But now we live in a completely different world where peoples careers are self-determined and where access to information is available everywhere instantaneously.
I thought the explanation that Sam provided for the subtlest differences in eye structure was very interesting.
Do people actually think having white skin means they reached a further, more advanced level of evolution?
Going to these little villages, seeing the poverty was horrible and after the villages we went to the kings palace and it was twice the size of the white house.
Much of our coverage of race relations is done by major news networks, which are normally very biased.
I studied my ass off freshman year in these engineering classes and wasn't yielding any results that reflected it.
This ultimately becomes a learning experience and forces you to reflect on what you have or dont have where you live.
Being conservative and being a racist are two very different things.
They love the sport and people who live there excel at it.
For the most part both our parents are accepting of it, or at least that is the feeling I get after meeting her parents just this weekend actually.
Their total disregard for facts like that we are 99.9% the same is baffling, and proves that they are a group of ignorant individuals.
Come elections, I watched my county go red.
I love listening to people talk, not just because of different dialects and languages, but because you just get a little glimpse into who they really are without even really talking to them.
All human beings have the ability to be athletic, extremely fit, strong, focused, etc.
In this specific video we had one student group others by appearance using only his own judgement.
I thought that truly went to show how people from all over the world could look so similar.
Sometimes I find myself doing that as well.
He then started to say how Siberia was part of Russia and Russia was a European Country so you could argue that all those people are European because theyre Russian.
The problem with race, in my opinion, is that it is not spoken enough about.
At first we thought the sun revolved around the earth.
The American-Korean and Korean activity was very intriguing to me and I definitely do not think I would have been able to identify them by their background.
I now see how much of a bubble we live in.
As the years passed I felt like I was stuck in the same dull learning routine.
We do not live in a perfect world, so everyone is bound to disagree.
The media wants to control your interpretations so they show nothing but the bad things about Afghanistan.
Socioeconomic status is a huge player in where the athletes end up at the professional level.
Some can argue that it is a primal instinct to fight for dominance.
Because of these reasons, I do not think talking about race relations is beneficial in the least.
Although she spent most of her time traveling and ended up settling down in NYC, she still has a ton of southern mannerisms.
Most of the people that govern Panama are white Christians with high economic status that end up leading with their interests firsts and the people's second.
I also believe that it can be seen as a geographical idea as well.
Talk about it, and don't make it uncomfortable.
And I also agreethat people looking to date in other races because it's exotic is not right.
Let me start with a little background.
I got into hockey only 4 years ago and never watched a game prior to that.
Before coming to the US I grew up in Ethiopia and attended a french school.
Though many individuals may disagree with this all you have to do is look at this countrys history and you can come to the conclusion that specifically African Americans and other minorities have been constantly scrutinized and dehumanized in order to make a whites man life better.
Almost all of the media has spoken about how kneeling is insulting to the military and distracting from the NFL.
Aside from evidence like that, I think that sports are inherently not racist.
I also agree that race should be most talked about in instances focused on race, like hate crimes.
I have always been interested in studying faces.
Professor Richards claims that in the future physical features that distinguish people of different heritage will fuse together and people will look much more similar to each other.
Why do we always see Jamaicans winning the Olympics 100m dashes?
It makes me wonder what the human race will look like in the future?
For example, the Alt Right group tries to make white people look the most advanced because they are the most evolved.
I completely agree with everything you said.
As a society, we tend to focus a lot on race and stop there, but everyone has a unique geographical history that displays itself through physical appearance as well as languages and accents.
Some fear the thought of change and will do anything or at all costs to preserve their way of life.
Overall, I enjoyed your response, and understand where you're coming from in all of your points.
I had played a multitude of sports throughout high school and still compete at the IM and Club levels here.
Until we learn how to educate our countrys youth, the country will never be able to move forward as one.
Now that these sports are more accessible, no matter what culture you are, or climate you live in, it is gradually starting to become more and more common for there to be a white NBA player or black NHL player.
Matthew, I could not agree more.
Sam at one point draws attention to the fact that many jump to the conclusion that America is the best country.
I do not really understand how they can think that white culture and white people are the most evolved because biologically we are 99.9% the same.
Personally, I would love to learn how to find key attributes of the different people around the world to correctly or at least try to group them together.
Although this sounds narrow minded of me, I just truly do not understand why people believe that they are better than others based off of their race or religion.
Due to the growing population of blacks in these groups, I believe more and more blacks will be seen playing lacrosse.
As opposed to popular belief, this continent was not discovered by the Europeans, it was looted and raped until most of its native population was wiped out.
I also found it so interesting as to how each student in the line dressed, talked, and even acted differently once they were all asked questions individually.
Sam tells us the point blank truth, and many people aren't used to hearing it since these tough topics are usually avoided and are left undiscussed.
I knew some of people who had been rejected based on their religion and origin, or they want to fit with others, as a result of that they denied their own county and principles to please some folks.
I too am a white individual and it is hard to believe that some people actually believe the alt right theories.
I think that media companies have actually hurt race relations, because it is more profitable to drive up a problem and make it worse than it is to genuinely help race relations.
No matter how much we study evolution, we will never be able to figure out how and why we were created, but that does not mean people cant have their own beliefs and theories.
I studied aboard last semester and traveled to 12 different countries throughout Asia, Africa, and Europe.
What does it mean to look Latino?
We take what the media portrays and dont think twice about how that could be completely wrong.
Race is just not something I am used to talking about so openly in our society.
I hope that the asian students didn't feel uncomfortable when the activity started because it is an obvious difference that these nationalities have from Americans.
In the United States specifically, race is a highly tense topic because of the current events that have been happening revolving around it.
In poorer, mostly black neighborhoods, kids grow up playing basketball with their friends down the street from their house.
For change to occur, race needs to actually be spoken about in a clear and open way.
Five minutes prior I had just preached sociology over biology.
It is a matter of training ones body to run faster and faster.
I think its informative because not all people are cultured.
Dropping them is easier said than done but will allow each race to place these issues behind them.
In the example from class, determining where different black people were from, it was interesting to see the differences.
How about just telling me that you disapprove of me dating someone who doesn't treat me right?
The first time I noticed myself stopping to reconsider my belief was during the biology vs. sociology lecture.
Your point about how different places around the globe have different climates which influence how peoplein that area look is something I can agree with.
Those values can either be positive or negative.
If you dont travel you wont see that the people half way across the world are just like us.
Without these external differences, we would not be here today because those differences are what led generations to keep passing on their genes.
Most of us are aware of the fact that certaingroups of people do have an advantage in this society, whether we like it or not.
I feel that if any other student was up there attempting what he did we all would have make mistakes in our selected groups.
In a school like Penn State its very easy to put into practice what we discussed in this lecture since there is people from everywhere.
When the student had to choose and group the students together he matches the facial appearances that were significant of their ethnic background and paired it with others who shared the same similarities.
Obviously, I cannot deny the history behind many of the sports.
Being really proud of whom you are and letting all else know that they are best.
The personal agenda in this case is the homophobia that occurs in American society, and Christians ability to make a claim against gay rights citing their faith.
Political leaders were united and were showing the people that it is ok to join together and vote for a common good.
What is the point of taking away a womans rights if you arent even going to give the man 100% of what he asked for?
I think this is important to recognize that the soldiers learn through these processes of how to interact and communicate with people of different culture.
I wonder if the Afghanistan children are raised feeling the same way about America.
Even if I was religious,I would not want to force other people to follow the guidelines of my personal religion.
It never occurred to me that there were jobs in the military where you are not constantly fearing for your life or having to dodge a bullet.
Hearing from Rafi truly put things into perspective for me.
It is a difficult task due to the fact that the book itself is relatively short.
The Constitution has adapted with time.
Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, etc, all were southern states that created these laws based on their Christian beliefs which are unfair considering our country was based on equal rights for everyone.
Then, who could forget Moas invasion of Tibet in which most of the entire country was completely destroyed?
My eyes were definitely opened about how many people tend to have tunnel vision when they are forming their opinions with religious reasonings.
They took control of whole nations like India and enslaved their people in a way.
It's discussions like these that really make you put yourself into someone else's shoes and appreciate the life you live.
It's shocking to see the pervasiveness of political figures and pundits pushing for Christian theocracy in the main stream media.
LTC Garey opened my eyes to the life of a soldier and explained what really goes on and the interactions between the two militaries.
I only go to mass every Sunday when Im home from school.
Another challenge lies in interpreting the Bible and Quran.
That is what I think the problem is, interpretation.
You can see some people who interpret the bible in order to justify their hate for gay people, which were seen in class.
The soldier also entered Afghanistan with the same hesitant perspective and it caused him to be distrustful of the local people.
However, I cannot imagine how life is for people who are learning religion in their school too because I believe the two do not mix at all.
Instead it's creating more controversy.
We came in and changed their way of life for their goods.
But we need to understand they consider themselves to be apart of the religion.
After this class I still believe the war is pointless for the most part, however, my reasoning for why it is pointless has changed.
The only thing that people talk about is that how that country has been a conflict zone and not really discuss the status of the innocent Afghan people.
Because of this, I have always associated Sharia law with Afghanistan, even though that is not the case.
People make their own decisions on what is right and wrong and THEN find parts of the Bible that support their beliefs and use religion as their backbone.
Even though I personally had never really taken the time to think about it, war affects innocent people that are just trying to get through life.
Especially coming from the east coast, known for our slight hostile nature, I have never associated generosity and friendliness as part of our community identity.
It's natural for humans to choose what they believe in, based on what they think is morally right.
Any person can pick and choose how to follow their faith.
If you are referring to what his opinions were beforehand then I think your statement is valid.
He then said that the political officials that were there were even encouraging woman to vote.
After all, they are both books that guide someone to the path of some sort of righteousness or fulfillment.
America has hundreds of different religions, and I strongly agree we will never be a country that operates under a singular religious sharia law.
Fortunately, he answered that question because another student had asked it.
I think people often ignore the fact that Christianity was forcibly spread.
Rafi definitely opened my eyes more to see how very similar our culture and beliefs can be.
I think the sensitivity and the gravity would definitely be more drastic.
Even for those who do not practice religion everyday and wouldnt call themselves a devout Christian, announcing a faith in God and adhering to American political traditions seems to be an unquestionably essential step in the campaign process.
Hence, many see countries in the Middle East as poverty-stricken wastelands, since they have nothing to tell them otherwise.
He talked about communities coming together to develop a plan for a government, and how to curb the Taliban.
I also think that the fact that someone in our class had their home bombed shows how close this problem is to us.
Although wars are a tragic and horrifying place to be, these men and women pull through it together for their fellow soldiers who theyve grown to love and for their country that they fight for everyday.
And to your point of the number of different authors of the Bible is something else to consider.
Holding racist, sexist, etc views are terrible but as long as you keep that view to yourself and let people live their lives life will continue.
All in all, I think the bible's rules are too strict.
Not all of them are our enemies; many have nothing to do with any of the fighting or conflict, they just happen to live there.
I was disgusted when I learned about the Catholic churchs history with pedophilia and sexual assault.
As previously stated, the Bible and the Quran are more similar than they are different, so why is it that there are so many differences between Muslims and Christians.
I feel like in part thats also do to the fact that after 9/11 America began to instill fear in their people of people from the middle east such as Muslims.
I agree with everything that you just said.
I feel like the combination of religion and state is what ultimately crippled many countries in the Middle East.
Especially since it is a war that Americans were apart of.
Can we say that someone really is not a Muslim or a Christian because of how they interpret the Quran or the Bible?
He was such a good man, educated, well spoken, courageous, but above all, a heart of gold.
I think people need to see more about the similarities among people instead of the difference.
Many people think this is discrimination.
I know a person who didn't even know there were shopping centers in Morocco.
This backlash goes to show that there should be this separation between the religion sector and the schools.
Finally, when Sam revealed his 1 percent African ancestry, I really wished everyone with racist views heard that loud and clear.
To short to easily use as a reference for the ever changing social landscape.
I cannot believe that I actually thought soldiers spend most of their time fighting and being in contact with the enemy.
It depends on what a person'sintentions were when reading that verse.
This is how evil comes to power.
Without being able to know about all the religions and cultural differences around the world, I believe many people will get stuck in that one-sided mindset where they blindly judge others without much knowledge.
There was support for a before school Bible study that occurred every Wednesday.
Its odd to me that such could even exist.
Sharia Law is using this book as a baseline of how to structure the laws and ideals of the land.
His stories put a face and life behind the idea of people living in a place experiencing war.
I've thought this way because of my own experiences growing up and because of it I could easily see how someone could do the same with the Quran.
I think having the Establishment Clause is vital for any country to thrive.
How are they justifying it with the Bible?
Religion has been used to justify oppression of minorities since its founding.
Thats a truly scary number of innocent people losing their lives.
He does a great job talking about specific interactions he had with all sorts of Afghani people who live lives just like me and you.
The current state of Mosul like the one Skype speaker was talking about makes it so important to understand why this issue is important to address.
I definitely feel like I take for granted the life and opportunity I have here in America.
At their core, they are a set of principles to live your life by.
Would that person be saved by God, or are they not considered a Christian based on their practices?
With all of these calls for a religious nation, it is shocking that nobody has called for our schools to be Christianized.
Two, realization from what Sam mentioned on how it is ridiculous to interpret and implement ancient laws into our modern society.
In terms of this criteria, many people (including those who criticize homosexuality) are technically going to hell too according to the teachings they believe so deeply in.
The Lords resistant Army is an African group that goes around killing Muslims that do not want to convert to Christianity.
I can appreciate this point of view, however I still contend there would've been a better way to go about it.
I've always thought that by default, I could imagine what it would be like to be someone living in a war torn area like Rafi and Bassim.
Anyways, Im wondering about the comparison.
Like with all the racism going on, those people claim to be very religious.
Speaking with Rafi threw me for a loop.
However, the Quran cannot solve all problems people face in their every-day life.
It also turns out that Afghani people dont all fervently hate Americans and our way of life.
It was terrifying to think of someone I loved in such a hostile place.
The fact that Sam thought switching the roles would make those people understand why our government is messed up is just sad.
Just like you said, this conflict is rooted in the idea of religious superiority.
This was an interesting perspective that I had not considered yet.
The pictures that Sam showed were all images of Black families thriving in society.
My uncle has been deployed twice thus far and each time I dismissed the reality because it was such an ungraspable concept, that he was going to war.
Their voting is unlike that of the United States because the people still have to worry about their safety when theyre voting and this often deters them from even coming where in the United States its simple and we just have to fill out a form.
Anyhow, while training discipline and strength is hardcore in the Military, people do have a bad stigma about soldiers.
I certainly didn't view Afghanistan as being quite similar to the US in regard to living conditions or its suburbs.
This part of the lecture is where I really began to think and gained more perspective of what an average Muslim believes.
ISIS is far from what the Quran teaches.
I wonder if they think that we are terrible people who want to be in war and are killing their family members for no reason.
When we look at the Islamic world, there are several divisions.
It is very hard to even begin to imagine living in a constant state of worry and fear.
I think he should do this more often when he compares Christianity to Islam.
By killing the bad guys, some of our people will also lose their lives.
If they were truly devout in their following of their religion, they would know they were in the wrong for causing such suffering, pain, and loss.
As the leader of our country, he should not put those who were standing up for equality on the same moral level as those who believe the complete opposite.
For example, the Uganda genocide of the 90s was a case where the nation did not have control of its own people.
I love how Rafi says that he knows peace always wins over war and that is what drives him to keep fighting until that is achieved.
I have always referred to these people, the people who mistreat others and justify it with the Bible, fake Christians.
I believe that the groups of people who created the Bible and Quran did it to be able to control large masses of people under fear.
They are losing loved ones too and have been in war for way too long.
It really brought the idea of war to life when he was saying how we cant just say kill the bad guys and the problem will be solved.
These men know this is their role in their community so they try and reach out to others in a hope of changing their life.
My personal belief is that there should be more recognition of both groups because this bias can lead to us being in trouble in the future.
Just because of one persons beliefs and mistakes, does not mean that the entire race or religion of those people is wrong.
Since no one ever gave a counter argument, it only led the professor to continue to use Christianity as his base point for the topics discussed.
It seems that almost every day there is news about some type of conflict or bombing that happened in the Middle East and I feel like you start to become desensitized to the situation.
These are very real concerns, but people in the Middle East seem to not care because they are so generous.
The media and our natural belief about the Afghani culture are the only reasons that can be used to show that the Afghani culture is based by violence and hate.
Along with what you were saying with war being a real thing and not just an idea, I also thought it was super interesting when Sam brought up the point that killing means being killed.
Therefore, from a young age, I realized that most people interpret the Christian teachings differently, even though its all based on the same one Bible.
In terms of religion and spirituality, I think it is better to be selfish and keep those things to yourself instead of trying to impose your values on other people.
Some of this does exist in the country, but it is not fair to categorize the whole country and everyone in it like this.
How could you justify killing, or ill treatment, of a certain type of people with the Bible?
The Establishment Clause is necessary for a secular state to function, and for a country as diverse as the United States to thrive, we must remain secular.
It is very easy to be passive about the news coming from Afghanistan.
The thing I think that really stuck out the most was how brave he was.
It was annoying growing up in Catholic school and being told what to believe over and over again, but they also do teach you about other religions too, and when youre older you have the ability to explore other religions.
He hasnt seen any change or greater acts of hospitality.
It is so easy to make assumptions about Afghanistan considering the only information I learned about that country in middle and high school was negative.
Even though I do not agree with this type of law, I have to understand that the people who do follow it most likely have grown up not knowing anything else.
I am more aware that these people are just like people in America.
Afghanistan has suffered a lot so I feel like people just want peace, so that is why they are indifferent to which side they choose to support or oppose.
This is because of the Islamic history and the wars that the Islamic world have gone through after the death of Prophet Muhammad Peace Be Upon Him.
The same principles are in both the Quran and the Bible, and still ring true today.
We talked about both sides of the war and how it affected both of these men.
I can not, nor do i want to, imagine a world where my life was always in danger and it actually made me sad for everyone in Afghanistan because in America, we are blessed with safety and protection and they will never be able to fully experience that.
I wanted to wear blue jeans and polo and it seemed if everyone thought it was a sin not to be dressed formally in the church or if we don't go to church ever Sunday.
Much of what the American public knows about Afghanistan stems from the fact that there was a war/conflict over there and from the persistent Islamophobia throughout our society.
Each nation should have the right to defend it's own land and make the decision that would best benefit them.
When Sam said what obligation do we have to learn about it?
But the pure kindness and selflessness Jesus showed through his actions is something everyone should look to embody.
So then why God would deny them the entrance to Heaven from something a person cannot change.
From Sams lecture, I realized the need to further educate myself on geography, culture, and physical features.
I think a question that I would like to ask Rafi if I had the chance to again would be why he continues to live in a war zone and raise his family there if fear for safety is such a concern.
Rafi narrated the sad story of the kids who were trying to show a peace sign to American soldiers and ended up dead by not finding the right bridge to communicate.
It seems even more wrong because nowadays humans are just a lot more connected, and traveling to a country governed that way could cause problems for the person doing the traveling.
Sam makes the argument that there is just as much of that same type of thinking going on in the United States, but with using the Bible instead of the Quran as a basis for law.
Americans do not always realize this because the war is being fought thousands of miles away from America, and they do not see the daily day-to-day struggle that soldiers and civilians constantly face.
Change can only occur with action, and that is something that needs to happen.
Both of these movies portrayed a picture of the land our country is at war with that is completely unrealistic for many everyday war situations.
Although when the general first was deployed to Afghanistan his beliefs about the culture were probably very different than they are now.
I have never thought about this from this angle before.
For this reason I've understood how people can interpret the bible, or any religious text to fit their beliefs, even those that are bound in hate or restrict others rights.
However, they have to live with the consequences of this war every day.
It is not like I actively chose to ignore their perspectives, but I just only subconsciously saw things from my point of view.
I had never truly thought about how our presence had disrupted the lives of so many in Afghanistan and gave way to groups such as ISIS.
I havent been to confession since I was sixteen.
However, I think he is afraid because he resonates the religion to the radical groups who practice that religion.
Sams lecture on Black Devils and Racial Supremacy was one that made a lasting impression in my mind and one that I felt needed to be discussed further.
I agree with the point you made on how there is no version of the bible stating that people who are different deserve to face hatred.
Garey said no because his mission was to find the Taliban not to drink tea, but he was just being stubborn.
This is another problem with these sacred texts is that they contradict themselves at times.
Later in your response you begin to focus on the media and discuss how the dont really show the full picture, and I fully agree.
Our race is constantly defending the actions of our ancestors.
This spread a politically endorsed statement that we need to protect our country from outsiders even though this country was founded through immigration.
Statistics are great and all but it we cannot show empathy to a stat sheet.
When the troops leave after a few days, the Taliban takes back control of the villages and the citizens are left in fear.
They put their head down, go about their business and are ignorant to what is happening around them.
People have the right to believe whatever they want to believe.
It's sad to think that the citizens of Afghanistan unfortunately can't walk around with the same mindset.
At the end of the day we are all one human race, trying to live our lives.
I have always heard that an important principle of Christianity is forgiveness, yet God cannot even forgive someone who drinks alcohol?
I know it is wrong, and it may just be subconscious in nature, but I too just kind of always thought: Oh an Afghani person?
This was my favorite part of the video because this is entirely too true of a statement.
Everybody should be able to practice whatever religion they want.
Reflecting upon the bible quote, Sam said that there is no room for homosexuals in heaven under the Christian religion.
But as Americans are we taught that?
On top of that, I found it really interesting how he kept trying to make it clear that most of his people do NOT hate America and ISIS is just a small group of extreme radicals.
It is like saying all Germans hate Jewish people, which is simply not true.
As a Muslim guy, those who interpret the holy Quran as a source for our modern life have to have an excellent background in Arabic, Islamic history and modern sciences.
I bet their interpretation of the bible was to eliminate any individual who opposed a certain pro white idea that they understood from the bible.
The Bible has not been written with adaptability so its still under the basis of how time was several thousand years ago so I agree that it really isnt to accurate in many of the issues we have now.
It is not fair that we get to ignore these real problems when they are affected by them every single day.
As the Colonel mentioned, Afghanistan has been in war for seemingly thousands of years, but we cannot look past the people who live there.
I know for a fact my family would not be welcoming to strangers from another country, let alone let them inside our house for tea.
He then discusses Religious Freedom Bills in certain states that claim they have the right to deny employment, religious performance, education, etc.
I agree with this post because when I picture Afghanistan in my mind I see a desert with destruction and war all over the place.
In other words, according to the law, teachers, lawyers, or political figures, cannot express their religious believes and/or favor one religion over another to support a certain idea or perspective.
For example, Sam brought up how a given section of Bible scripture states that homosexuals will not be accepted into heaven, which most are aware of.
But then when we look at what that specific blurb actually said, it showed that basically a very select few of us will make it heaven in the eyes of the bible.
Putting a face to the war was definitely something I needed to see, and it has changed my perspective on it.
They have conflict there but the vast majority of the country is like us and the media does not show that.
Which I think brings up a good point.
After this lecture, it made me want to take a stand and make some kind of impact about this topic.
Honestly, the teachers are what started to push me away from religion.
As sad it is for me to say it, I also always thought of Afghanistan as a war zone with tiny towns and nothing else.
Hearing first hand from someone who was impacted by the events, opened my eyes in ways I didnt realize was possible.
That is whether a person has faith in Jesus Christ.
The same was done by the Spanish in the Philippines.
I was thinking it was something to do with fighting and military action when it turned out to be about politics.
When the tribal leader asked him to come to his house for tea LTC.
When Sam compared Islamic Sharia Law to an Christian Sharia, I began to see striking similarities.
If we could all just step back, and try to understand one another, this world would be a much better place.
The media made it seem as if the country had always been totalitarian and strict.
Its very interesting to get perspective of the war from a soldier who has been there first hand.
He literally says to love everyone, but yet they are doing exactly the opposite.
But why, still, after all of these years, can't we look past the differences and finally realize that all of our morals and values are similar.
For example, the furious media coverage that has been following the NFL as a result of Colin Kaepernick sitting down during the national anthem.
Depending on who I asked, I usually got varying responses and answers.
It also makes me feel disgusted about this war because more innocent civilians die than soldiers do.
To prevent people form being consumed by a religious ideology, we shouldinstead teach people that all religioustexts are meant to be stories which one may read to expand one'sworld view.
I understood the intention behind switching the dynamic to making white people the victim and making the few people that dont sympathize with the black lives matter movement understand that white supremacy is a thing but he could have gone about in a completely different way.
We do not, however, see the aftermath or the actual events of the civilians being hit with war materials.
The easy way to undercut what Sam is saying here is to point out that pigs and humans are easily more than 20% different which suggests that genetic similarity may not be the best indicator of sameness.
For me, the most important aspect of the Christian religion is the new testament; it is a story full of hope, redemption, change, and forgiveness.
On the other hand, I do believe that following the bible's teachings down to the T is not a great idea either.
We discussed what Sharia is and all of the misconceptions about it.
I know I would not be able to act the same way as him if I was in a similar situation.
Same goes for transportation, we can now travel, visit, go work and many other things so much easier and accessible that it gives us a whole lot more options and opportunities.
He has actually made me more interested in learning about Islam and the Quran.
I personally feel that this issue should be taken into further consideration as these lives should not be ignored or treated as close to nothing.
As fortunate as we are to be in a country without an active war zone, I believe its also a major contributing factor to why we so easily forget.
This has been shown throughout history.
This is the same with many Muslims who aim to live by the Quran.
There are citizens in Afghanistan who live/ previously lived very similar to us.
Like you, my eyes have been opened greatly, and it is all thanks to Sam and Rafi's friendship.
I really felt for this man at this point because throughout his life he has had a variety of groups try to come into his city and take it over.
As Sams lectures tried to show, Christians can be just as awful and inhumane as anyone as groups like the Lords Resistance Army run around slaughtering innocents in the name of the Christian God.
The best I can say to motivate people to learn is for American education systems to teach children about other countries' culture including our own.
Hopefully watching a clip like this can help at least one person look past their narrow point of view and realize it is not just Muslims who are violent.
Gay marriage is a taboo topic that makes most people squirm at a minimum.
Clearly there are occasions where it is necessary and important to open up that dialogue but it feels as though over the past few years it has become almost excessive.
I can relate to what you said about your dad being raised in India and being able to tell the difference between a person being from eithersouth or north.
My aunt got divorced, my cousin, and later friends came out as gay.
In America, we try to make a big deal about not judging a book by its cover and giving people the benefit of the doubt before we make an assumption but when it comes to acceptance of people from other countries we immediately assume the worst and put them into the most negative stereotype possible.
What I got from him speaking on it really just brought me back to a history class with the founding fathers.
If the government forces the bakery to serve the couple that would actually be conflicting with Sam point.
I do not see Sam as an open minded professor anymore.
From this video I understood that it really takes stepping out of your own cultural bubble to truly understand other cultures and to rid yourself of common misconceptions.
Now that I think about it more, these radical groups were drawing their ideology from the same text that I was being taught kindness and tolerance.
However, it demonstrated how the world is changing.
During the crusades white, Christians went out and murdered 1.7 million people.
We know that today in the United States whether you are a husband or wife you have the ability to get divorced and it cant be refused.
In my opinion that was the biggest take away from this video, how real war is.
I was raised by two Catholic parents and taught that every Sunday I was to go to church or CCD.
He put up pictures of white Christians who committed heinous crimes, including the one person who shot up a black church because he believed that was what the bible was telling him.
When he said he had a very different image of what Afghanistan was like from what it actually is I was thinking the same thing.
These decisions are what often what leads to arguments, confrontation of many religious groups, and the ever-present possibility of war.
I myself was raised a catholic, but stopped practicing around age 15 because I did not feel that I had true faith in the things I was reading or participating in.
And that the terror that people experience would not be different if a similar tragedy took place back here.
Since society has evolved so much today, the values have too.
The news never shows first hand stories on how the afghan citizens are affected.
I really would just want to see all religions get along and agree that the extremists are the scum of the earth.
I never realized the importance of connecting with the people of the villages.
However the overarching ideas of these two texts promote good values and provide ways in order to live better lives.
Sam explains Islam Sharia Law being just one of many ways of interpreting the Quran.
I don't have any issue with those who truthfully and whole heartedly believe and follow their religion.
I think people need to stop trying to interpret the bible because its not suppose to be used to judge other people its supposed to guide the reader to their own journey.
There are things stated in the bible that get misconstrued.
This hospitality was something that he had not seen in the US.
God will know that you aren't serious about trying to be a good follower.
I know people always say why can't just be peaceful after all we are all humans but i think LTC Garey goes deeper into the subject.
You believe you are on the side of the good or the just or the righteous, but in reality youre incorrect, just as incorrect as all before you and ahead of you.
It is only be accepting our ability to war can we prevent it.
I think people are so compelled and fascinated by their own religion that they are not able to disagree with others without pointing it out and causing more issues.
Like you mentioned, it doesn't surprise me either that people in this part of the world don't like Americans.
It all depends on what you decide is relevant to your faith, and its the same way with Islam.
People can't make their own educated guesses and conclusions about a topic without taking the time out to understand it.
There was fear against the Islamic terrorist groups from retaliating against the U.S troops.
This is something that I do not think about because I live in America and the war zone is in a different country.
It is no longer acceptable to cut the hand off a thief, or to stone an adulterer, yet the religious texts make it very clear that these were the punishments these acts deserved.
I also think that Lieutenant Gareys responses and stories were very interesting and shocking.
That is a shame, but at the same time it is the world we live in and part of being an adult is maintaining employment and making compromises.
In this video Sam does a great job of explaining it using the analogy of a fish to water.
All of humanities problems can't be boiled down and solved in a single book.
The Bible has a finite number of pages so it is unlikely that it could address all of our modern day issues.
Other than that I agree completely about your comments regarding how people view other cultures.
Lastly, I believe that people in the United States only know the worse of the Muslim and Islamic religions.
Many ignorant people just want to go into the army to be able to hold a gun and shoot people like if it was a video game.
Definitely we have been influenced by movies or TV in general which only shows a really small percentage of what soldiers actually and normally do in the middle east.
How could you possibly believe that what you are doing is right?
He points out multiple different laws and criminal actions that aren't found in the Quran and how people would just interpret each infraction.
I definitely agree with you on the fact that people base their views primarily on other peoples opinions.
The only way to stay away from this type of thinking is to really have an open mind about different religions, as well as understanding your own a little more.
I think it would be very easy to get discouraged living in a war zone, but seeing Rafis compassion for others and his country is so heartwarming.
I am not a religious person, although I respect everybody's right to practice their own religion.
While sitting in class I was listening to him as he made the assumptions of the perfect usage of the bible.
I think having a common understanding of God and even just religion in general is important for the morals and principals that this country tries to instill.
And if no one ever made the effort to seek out other ways of thinking we would all be closed minded individuals with no culture.
Having Rafi talk and show pictures of his family and talk about how he must fear for his life daily because of his job made this new perspective even more real for me.
I already got the point that the system is rigged, Race relations should be about how to fix it currently, just talking about it wont do anything for anybody.
I agree that we couldnt have a Christian Sharia in this country.
This gave me some perspective and showed that the people of Afghanistan are great people too just like us.
You have people who have the same dreams and aspirations as any person in the US as well as radical groups who want to push their ideas down peoples throats.
Destroying everything that he is used to.
Do not be deceived; neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate nor those who participate in homosexuality.
Is it the stereotype that they take away your individuality?
Lieutenant Colonel Garey's personal experience in the Middle East is very eyeopening, because even he has trouble understanding some of the cultural differences at first.
Also as Shelby mentioned, it is very interesting how people for a long time were okay with homosexuals being singled out until they realized that the bible also excluded many other groups of people.
I actually feel guilty for not knowing what is going on.
But who's to say there is a correct meaning?
What is shown on television could just be the slums, or in certain cases, the places most affected by the wars taking place.
I did not realize that the people of the country are very similar to us Americans especially when he said they have children, aspirations, jobs and hopes.
One of the main points made recently that I found interesting was the comparison between Islam and Christianity (Quran vs the bible).
I think that it was important that Sam brought LTC Gary to speak to our class because when someone who has been at war can present what it truly is like it can give you perspective from the soldiers in these countries.
However, when you are a member of the church, it is easier to try to distance yourself from the radical hate groups by saying they are not practicing the same religion.
The person that lived in the village only talked when LTC Garey went into his house and later found out that the guy was not talking because there were enemies in the village that would see him cooperating.
The other example that Sam provides shows just how differently the readings, should they cover a topic, could be interpreted.
They want the same things for their kids as we do.
To follow a sacred text that was written thousands of years ago may not really apply to todays life situations.
People in the Army are also being affected by this war in Afghanistan.
Most of us when we watch the news about war just listen to it for a couple minutes and feel bad at the moment and continue doing what we are doing.
What surprised me and also Garey was how polite and inviting the Afghan people were to our troops.
People need to stop focusing on what history has made of us and start focusing on what we can do to change the path of our religious judgments from the past.
If you really read any of the holy works they all teach morality and a way of life away from hate and violence.
Sam mentioned his friend, Maziar (probably incorrect spelling), who used to be in the Iranian military.
I have to agree with you when you say this has been one of your favorite topics to learn about.
We see the war as a whole when in fact, its quite the opposite.
What about if he performs oral sex before marriage, is he doomed for hell?
Seeing and having the opportunity to hear from Rafi Nadiri, as well as hearing about his family and his hardships, showed me that war is not just an abstract concept simply because I am not affected by it in my daily life.
In this video, Sam asked LTC Garey who the Afghan people really are.
Sharia Law, be it Islamic Sharia or Christian Sharia, could never work because of how much people would disagree on the actions that are taken.
But it was very interesting to see what it is really like over seas and to hear personal stories about their lives.
When I got the alert on my phone that this class was going to be the best of the semester, I was eager and anxious about what was going to happen later that day.
What Sam is doing is so important and it makes me happy a class like this exists at penn state.
I really enjoyed reading your post and agree completely with what you had to say.
If you asked someone where you thought that picture was taken I think the last guess would be in Afghanistan because of the misconceptions of that area.
The person who actually wrote the Bible may not have liked gays, however this is a guide on how to be a good person.
I think that people do not take other perspectives often and also do not truly know what is going on in the world around them.
Especially when Christian extremists are killing masses of people in the name of God around the world as well.
We as Americans take for granted our safety.
Civilians are affected daily.
Therefore it is not logical to use this book as the final say in all matters of law.
However when watching this activity unfold, I had a very hard time pigeonholing who belonged where.
After sitting through these lectures and hearing from Rafhi, I now feel compelled to act and help spread peace throughout our country and the world as a whole.
I am a Christian, and this lesson did not offend me.
Too often do dictators take power, and see the world as tyrannical, when it is they themselves who are the tyrants.
Although it may seem silly, these groups of people use a book, the Quran, as a guide to moral principles and to govern rules in their societies.
Seeing a pictures of the shopping mall, the traffic jam were all things we could relate to.
Instead the best you can get here is a friendly response followed by their regression back into their cell phone.
First of all, the Quran and the Bible are truly not that similar; yes, they both teach familiar religious ideas (redemption, forgiveness, love, acceptance) but the figure heads of the religions are entirely different.
I think that what is even worse is that this whole situation could have been avoided where both people would not have had to suffer.
I sincerely hope Basim gets what he deserves because nobody should ever go through the pain that he went through.
Although, Christian and Muslim core values are usually virtuous, the texts were written in a different age.
He said he gets threats on his life every single day, purely because he is trying to win women more rights and that must not line up to the liking of ISIS and traditional Afghanis.
I believe often in Christianity, people view the rules of the Bible to be flexible to fit their own agenda, which I find very interesting.
No body will understand life in a warzone, unless you directly experienced it, but the best thing that people can do is learn first hand about how real and dangerous of a place it is.
I cannot speak much on the Quaran as I have not read it, but I assume it is much like the old testament to the Bible.
However, I was raised Catholic and find religion interesting.
I also found it very interesting on how he asked everyone in the class if they would be going into heaven based on the sins that would not allow them on the board.
For example, it states in the Bible that if you are gay you will go to hell.
I have never understood why people spend so much time fixating on the decisions and actions of others.
War Affects Real People stood out to me this week., and struck a nerve.
This lecture definitely spoke to me because I wonder all the time how people interpret the Bible in so many ways but claim to be a part of the same religion.
Pointing out the flaws of both religious texts emphasized truly emphasized how similar they really are.
In a similar fashion, movements for equality have continued to occur without any major change.
However, I disagree with your claim that race and color are two different things.
They all have families, jobs, friends, and a lot of other similarities that we should always take into consideration before we take any action.
He was very well educated first of all.
So how can someone justify their actions or discriminate others because of how they personally felt the bible was trying to say.
War is becoming more of an economic reason rather than a safety reason.
Being a follower of a radical religious leader means that those people must be the least smart and self-aware people on this earth.
Since Ive lived in the US my whole life, Ive never really been exposed to war and how it affects civilians.
The way he describes how his duties center on understanding other cultural perspectives and norms of the civilians was the main draw of the video.
This lecture series also really spoke to me because I was unaware of a lot of what Afghanistan was and what the war over in the middle east has been.
No matter how respectable and civil our troops are, I can imagine that it is still tough to adapt to at times, especially given the circumstances.
I too was extremely intrigued about what he had to say and I felt this was the most important question posed during class.
I think it was important that Sam discussed this point.
I coming from the same place as you when you say that you don't have much background information on why this war is continuing for so long or why we even started it in the first place.
I feel like other people should learn not to judge someone by the area that they live in and actually give people a chance to show who they are as a person rather than grouping all of one ethnicity into a category just because of whats happening in the world.
Continuing to do this is only going to lead to more hate and conflict.
I learned how the soldiers have to work hard to understand the peoples cultural norms because otherwise there can be tons of miscommunication and problems.
First off I really didn't know what Sharia Law was before we learned about it in class.
The video clip I have decided to respond to is the one when Sam was discussing radicalizing the Bible.
All of the power that words and a couple pages tied together hold is undeniably intimidating and even in some cases deadly.
My home town is one of the places that the Establishment Clause is designed for.
The importance of realizing the civilians being killed over seas arereal people makes the concept of war a little less foreign and alotmore scary.
Our sports teams are very diverse and the good players are not always stereotypical race that goes with the sport.
I feel that it is everyones duty to at least understand that war is a tangible and real thing.
Growing up in a Christian family and going to church every Sunday it is safe to say that I have had my fair share of exposure to the religion.
So, why is it so hard for Christians to see Muslims as christians (with a lower-case c) and vise-versa.
That the small difficulties I might face is nothing compared to people living in third world countries.
I thought this was a really fascinating point.
These people protest against the LGBT community claiming their faith commands them too.
But some people read them and use them as a means to justify their clearly wrong and hateful actions.
Obviously, the biggest argument against the holiness of confession is the fact that there are thousands of Catholics and Christians who won't go to mass every Sunday.
He even tried to withhold further bad news when he hesitated to tell us that the United States only offered him about 2 thousand dollars to compensate for the complete destruction of his home and family.
I understand how important religion and faith is to those who choose to believe but to allow that religious novel to be what you live your life by is ridiculous.
So much culture within areas within areas in America and we don't now what's there more than we don't know what's outside of our country.
For myself, when meeting new people, I often think about where they come from.
I still don't know that much about it, but getting that wake-up call that war is a real thing, that involves real people like all of us, has made a difference in my view.
He tells of the political leaders in Afghanistan who came to this gathering to encourage citizens to vote.
I agree with you when you say that we should just use the Bible as the basis or foundation which we should establish our society.
Never mind the fact that often times these opponents are also Christians, just not fundamentalists.
Such a system would not be accepted by most in the modern world.
Hearing about both the lives of the Afghan people, and the Soldiers that serve our Country made me forever grateful.
Telling people that God or any supernatural being would punish them for eternity if they were to break any rules allowed governments to control people and manipulate them to do anything.
Would more people be interested in actually helping the people?
I have always felt that God is a lover of all people, regardless of what one verse in one chapter of the Bible says.
Many practicing hold the Bibles scripture as law and aim to live by it, word for word.
However, some light research will tell you that pigs and humans are about 80% genetically the same which for me undermines the ethos of Sam's argument a little.
I, too, was raised Christian and went to Catholic school.
When he was speaking about the one man who was changing his affiliation with whoever was in charge at the time.
From the outsider perspective America is seen as a nation that should always help others.
You get married because you love the person unconditionally and if something happens where they cannot have children it shouldnt be so easy to just leave them.
Views on abortion and gay rights are a lot more socially acceptable than when the Bible was written.
He said this as if it was the most ridiculous thing he has ever hear.
To decide there is no reason to be good and to give in to temptation without hesitation.
Not because we mean to but because we also grow up surrounded by stereotypes and common misconceptions.
Although there should be no religious affiliation in the government that does not carry over to private businesses.
Sam dug deeper and went on to discuss questions that pertain to these issues.
I am way more aware of the reality of Afghanistan now than I was before and I think everyone needs to be informed on it as well.
I believe that they are raised to hate a separate group, and only use the holy works to justify their hate of another group, but still how could anyone read the bible and interpret it to hate any one group of people.
It was great to hear from Rafi.
How could we possibly let it govern our lives?
We think that so much of the Sharia law principles are so strict and foreign to us, when they're really not.
I believe this is a controversial topic and many people probably have different opinions on this subject.
As a Christian it is easy for me to make the separation between me and a white nationalist who says they are Christian.
They stated that they bring gifts every time they visit, even though they do not have high incomes.
Listening to Rafi talk about much power a woman has in regards to splitting with her husband is really interesting.
And he also brought up that fact that they are breathing living religions that are constantly changing and forming new opinions about different topics.
There were many different aspects of the recent lectures that strongly stuck with me.
For example, in movies, we see the action-packed scenes in which soldiers are shooting each other in ruined cities as bombs go off everywhere around them.
But, for my older sister the Bible worked, just did not work for me.
I need to do better than that.
Likewise, the Quran states that Those who consider the Quran to be mere fables will be branded on the nose (Quran 68:15-16).
From what the soldier said this seems to be quite the opposite as he was treated with decent hospitality.
If no one will educate us on the innocent people overseas, Americans will keep assuming they are all bad and the fighting will never stop.
Therefore, that is where my beliefs and moral compass was developed.
However, when white supremacists are marching and chanting threatening speech towards minorities, then race IS the issue.
Think about it, you are welcoming a complete stranger into your home without any knowledge about them.
Granted, not everyone is nice and some people just want to make money and do not care how it affects others.
We must realize that both books have truths hidden in them and it is our duty to live out those truths.
You made me think when you said you tried to picture an America where you were always scared for your life and it really puts into perspective how sad and scary the whole concept of war really is.
I also liked how he spoke about how the war has taken a lot from their country but the people are still friendly.
Obviously war is terrible in many ways, but it is inevitable.
Even if they aren't allowed to mix church and state, the majority of the country is Christian, so its hard not to use the two together.
This is definitely true when talking about afghanistan.
By having a better understanding, they can become more appreciated in other countries.
Since 2001, the numbers of Afghan civilians killed have grossly increased.
Everything involving Sharia is relative.
Live and let live is exactly right.
Another thought I had was what about the people who don't follow the book.
I personally believe that this is something that is taught in groups.
The Colonel stated they have aspirations and hopesthey come home from work, share a meal, and go to sleep.
This is the exact same thing that ISIS is doing.
But to those people who fight it and live it, the war is the center of their universe.
This is something that is needed in order for a country to be successful.
They come from a country they are used to, big cities, lots of cars and storefronts, not a lot of desert to a place where there is a lot of people but not a lot of space for those people to live.
I did not know much about Afghanistan before the speakers but I certainly did not think they were just like us!
Many of the same people regularly share parables on social media and promote putting the Christ in Christmas.
He risks his life everyday, even after his close friend and partner was killed, for the greater good to make Afghanistan as safe and stable as it could be.
If everyone acted like Jesus the world would obviously be a better place.
LTC Garey informed the class that very few times he has been in high danger and high intensity situations while overseas.
This interaction is truly amazing because it brings people from across the world together.
The Quran is a holy book that is very much similar to the Bible.
If the Bible was going to cover every issue possible it would have to be much longer.
Having talked about this in our discussion class as well.
I have always believed that the Bible is the only resource that can bring humans closer to God.
Like not stealing, killing, or hurting others emotionally.
I thought it was interesting to hear what he was saying about the first picture that came up in the class.
What the media doesn't show American's is how generous Middle Easterners genuinely are.
This is incredible nave and to believe that I thought this for any amount of time makes me sick.
That is not necessarily a fault of ours or something that cannot be understood and forgiven.
And that for two decades they have kept living in this tragic state.
The basis of the hatred definitely starts off with our differences in how we look, act, are raised, and so on.
Every religion picks and chooses which issues they support and dont.
It made me think of my family and how I cant even imagine what it would be like to grow up in a war zone.
It lightens the mood and gets everyones attention for the juicy stuff he gets into next.
Religion should be used to bring communities together, not build walls between them.
And if someone else has a different reason as to why they might have had a bad impression when they think of soldiers initially, I guess I would like to know.
Sharia law in the Middle East forces women to cover themselves and puts men about women.
For instance, the leaders previously election in the government and town leaders all come together and meet in one place so that they can encourage individuals from all over to come out and vote in this years election.
For example, I completely agree that the media does put too much emphasis on race in their headlines, especially on criminal trials.
I chose this video because I thought it was a really important piece of class.
I have done a decent amount of traveling and have found this to be majorly exclusive to our country (just in comparison with the other places I have been).
The Bible and the holy Quran share many similar lessons and historic events that shaped the history of humanity.
When we saw the chart of the civilian deaths, I just thought about how some people with similar aspirations to my own would be unable to fulfill them because they may be caught up in a war that they do not even want.
We need to have these discussions about the histories of our texts in order to show how they are merely stories told for centuries.
Instead we just sit here and live within our tightly circles afraid to branch out.
When he comes back he tells us stories and one story he told us was how he and his wife went out on the back porch of the house in Lebanonand his wife said wow look at the beautiful fireworks, and he had to inform her that it was not fireworks and actually bombs going off.
I remember thinking how could this happen, this doesnt happen, but the reality is, it does, and many suffer from it.
Now, it is more understandable that so many US soldiers come back to the states with symptoms of PTSD, which takes a while, if not the rest of their lives, to overcome these horrific memories as a soldier because they must find the death of innocent civilians as hard to watch as the death of their fellow soldiers.
Nothing of what was said by Gary would be construed as rational thought by a majority of people in society, and the fact that he is willing to ignore one of the most fundamental principles of our government is astounding.
When Sams friend talked about how he had no hate towards Americans in general and more just prayed for himself and prayed for his family it realized we have a totally different aspect on life than people from other countries.
The harsh reality of this is that's the complete opposite to what others see the U.S. as.
After mentioning the real things in Afghanistan, Sam went on and show us an example of the real people there.
We can do an interactive activity without offending people, and I know several students were offended or at least felt uncomfortable by what was said and presented.
It was really eye opening to hear about Sharia and what the true definition of sharia law.
They know that there will be conflict and that it is unavoidable.
I have always thought that Afghanistan was just supposed to be hated so I do not see it as a home or a safe place.
I believe that we all too can have that mindset if Rafi is able to be a strong advocate for peace while living in a war zone, receiving death threats, and losing innocent loved ones due to the war.
Not every person affiliated with sharia law are terrorists.
The media needs to do a better job of representing the peaceful Islamic people as well as the spiteful Christian people.
I think that the material presented is definitely important and requires a thought-provoking discussion, but we shouldn't have to switch roles in order for certain people to understand.
I also agree that this was an eye opening exercise for me.
I wouldnt want to be judged as a Christian on the actions of Westboro Baptist Church - I dont agree with the way they choose to follow God.
One story in particular that has stuck in my mind is when Jesus says if your leg or arm or hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it into the fire.
This idea had amazing intentions and effectively accomplished them.
Why couldnt the class be about coming up with a solution to the current problem.
This same perspective can be flipped and said about the Afghani people as well.
It's hard to completely eradicate the sensitive or touchy words, ideas, and topics.
However, this could not be more wrong.
Although, these are never really things that come to our minds when Afghanistan is mentioned.
Many were forced to remove their hijab out of fear of public reaction.
This also needs to be applied in the way muslims are treated in America on a day to day basis.
I have been to church and it is a wonderful place to learn a lesson and see people but it is my feeling that most people there probably aren't really practicing what they preach.
His analysis on peoples physical features has opened my eyes to see how they can play a role in an environment and determining individuality.
The governor of the province was trying to get people to vote for him, in a civil way which caught my attention.
Because no one wants to feel stupid---there's that.
Many civilians in the middle east have been living in conflict for their entire lives and have lost many loved ones.
I can see what you are saying about interpreting what the Bible differently.
Instead of trying to paint the world as this idealistic place in which happiness and compassion and empathy should rule, we need to address our innate drive toward violence.
All of a sudden I felt empathy for not only him but all of the other people that have had to go through the same thing but never got their story told.
They both believe the culture is giving and welcoming.
Like Sam said in the video, other countries barely speak on their versions of racism.
I found it very interesting when the man in ROTC spoke about his service overseas.
I can tell when someone is from certain parts of the state depending how they say certain words.
I wouldnt call myself a very religious person but I do have faith and have somewhat of a religious outlook on some issues.
However, there are still individuals that choose to only find what they want to recognize as a sin.
Do not spare them or shield them.
Christians were going out and killing residents at other nations if those residents did not convert to Christianity.
It reminded me that they are not all that different from people in America.
Their acts, and their twisting of what I believe to be right, makes me question the Bible.
I also thought it was funny but very eye-opening that when Sam asked everyone to raise their hands if they did not go against the bible in any way, only one person raised their hand.
It is dangerous to assume that someone is of good character simply because of a claim of faith.
It was so interesting to listen about this topic because it is something you hear about and see on the tabloids daily.
He came to the conclusion that learning the culture was very important.
It prevents the Christian majority in my home town from dominating all others.
You must also recognize and claim the same of your own religion.
A lot of people in the United States will talk about this issue before they get married because a good chunk of the population would like to have children.
The British colonized half the world, killing millions in the process.
As a Christian I do believe that the Bible is incredibly ambiguous.
It means that the small Atheist, Jewish, Islamic, and Hindu population can attend public school without feeling completely alientated (although our very curriculum is suited towards white Christian history and literature).
This conflict of interest in the bible opens up the argument of what happens to a homosexual that has faith in Jesus Christ.
Malls, highways full of cars, people doing the same things I do at home.
I think it has little to do with religion.
I liked this post because I too had the same feeling when Professor Richards said that the Quran and the bible were not that different.
As Sam has pointed out multiple times in his lecture he prays but does not believe in a god.
War is affecting real peoples lives.
When Garey talked about how he showed up in a village and an old man offered him tea and he automatically thought that it was a trick, it shows how we were raised.
It turns out that American soldiers care about the lives of these people more than anyone.
We truly never know what actually happens until we hear about it first hand, I too am grateful to learn and listen to Rafi's story.
After hearing these lessons I realize how important it is to stay educated and understand the lives of the innocent Afghanistan people.
To me it just seems like the founding fathers had it right to keep church and state separate.
Next, the laws that Sam quoted from a majority of states were absurd and shocking to me.
Little children are growing up in a war zone over a fight that they do not understand, civilians are being murdered over a fight that likely did not involve them specifically.
Logically, soldiers develop a deep trust and love between one another through moments of extreme fear, sadness, or relief, as mentioned by LTC Gary.
I couldn't agree with you more.
Its bad enough that women in America are still treated unequally and unfairly, mainly in the workforce, its impossible to fathom what it must be like to be a woman of the Middle East.
He said that if the Taliban is there then he is a member of the Taliban but if the Americans are there he is for their cause.
I agree the old testament is flawed, but I dont believe christianity should be vilified for this part of itself.
The four reasons all make sense, but of course any reason should be a reason if you do not want to remain married to someone.
If I were in the shoes of the civilians, I would not have as much respect for the soldiers as they deserve.
Christians are quick to forget that they caused an entire holy war during the crusades.
The future of war across the world is unclear but as long as the tensions in the middle east stay unresolved, then we are all at risk.
I believe that this also brings an interesting spin on how people view it.
I completely agree with your statement that as a society we are numb to the war that is happening overseas.
It supposed to be a somewhat serious matter because they are selecting the next individuals who are going to lead them but they also want to show them to be relaxed and enjoy the experience.
If troops from a foreign nation were walking in my neighborhood, I would not feel the urge to invite them in for tea or anything.
The southern states supported slavery even after they lost the civil war and didnt believe in equality.
Also, our society likes to find groups or individuals to blame, which can lead to further stereotyping.
My personal relationship with my religion and faith is what led me to see Sam's argument so easily, because I already mostly believed it myself.
Whether it is a christian coffee shop, muslin bakery, or atheist restaurant, the company should have the ability to practice their religion in their work place.
The second point I disagree with you on is you saying that a person should rely on their experiences, not the written words of a book, to guide their lives.
I've always believed that religious texts are open to a variety of interpretations.
If that was said about a white person it would be a huge deal, but nobody seemed to bring it up during class.
Sam shows us that Afghanistan has shopping malls and small family shops, too.
Sam begins to unpack this much more later in his lecture, but this preface for the lecture truly gave me and Im sure my peers much more perspective of Islam in the middle east.
I think the media has a lot to do with the way Americans view Afghanistan.
I feel like hearing the story from Sam and then being able to actually talk and ask questions was an amazing experience and I was glad to be a part of it.
Just like many Christians, many Muslims do not count ISIS as a Islamic group because how they interpret the Quran is not that same as how ISIS interprets it.
So these locals were stuck in an indeterminable position where both sides could be a potential threat.
It would be beneficial for everyone to discuss this topic rather than quietly continuing to think negatively about a group of people that you may not know much about.
I also feel that homosexuals not invited to the Christian community is hypocritical.
He went in not knowing much of their culture and their ways and left frustrated because he didn't get the information he needed.
It upsets me immensely that people like us living overseas in a different country have to live with the everyday possibility of dying.
I also thought this specific class was interesting and insightful.
It is so great to be able to better understand the world around us!
White people aren't called the white devil because such a thing would be rude and condescending, so why is it ok when we use that phrase for black people?
We have all heard the statistics about racism in the work place.
Although this seems harsh for Hollywood to do to citizens in movies, it happens in real life.
In Islam, Muslims are supposed to follow the rulings of the Quran and the hadith.
So in this present, we are aware of the many wars happening in other countries.
I liked the repetition of his account of the people having the same jobs, hopes, and aspirations because it visualizes for us, the audience, their life as more than people stuck in a warzone.
I personally had a hard time imaging everyday people living in Afghanistan.
This segment of class really opened my eyes to how living in a conflict zone can affect people just like me.
For example, the word Satan is taken from the Egyptian word Set, also known as the god of death, Anubis.
Does this make shaving a sin?
I believe when technology evolves and everyone has the opportunity to be exposed to several points of views, then violence through religion and religious ideologies like Sharia will be abolished.
Soldiers leave war with many unique stories andexperiences, which is why they might have different feelings towards other cultures.
If it can happen in Christianity it can happen with any religion or belief system and I think this is important to consider before we pass judgements on those who are different from us.
I have been exploring other religions and my mother is okay with it.
So, why does our culture fail to recognize that we are surrounded by so much picking and choosing?
I was never really interested in the thought of going to church but my parents wanted me to go, so as always I listened.
Religion only gives people the audacity to flaunt their beliefs, claiming they are words of higher power.
It was interesting how he connected using social media to being a reviler, like using abusive language, as many people engage in that on a daily basis.
Divorces in this day and age are inevitable because not everyone is as compatible as they thought.
A lot of the laws seemed written in ways that dodged equality which makes sense when you think about the time period.
This class has bored me thus far, and I sit here unimpressed in the slightest.
People begin to label other people without knowing who that person really is.
Despite Iran being known as an enemy state of the US, Maziar talked and laughed with the former US military members, sharing experiences as they had a special connection with a lot in common.
Not being able to have a family is a very important thing for most people.
Although after Sam showed us the pictures of Rafi's family and other families in Afghanistan, it put the war in a new perspective for me.
I agree that a majority of people who voted for Trump blatantly ignores his flaws, but I can not believe that Trump would allow somebody like that to work for the government.
Sam's example about divorce puts in perspective that we need millions of pages just to describe the legality of divorce.
From the beginning of time, people have always been told that Whites are superior.
Every human being is capable of composing their own thoughts and beliefs, so using one book to solve every known problem is bound to lead to arguments.
But as time has passed, people have chosen to just forget.
Although I agree religion should not be part of the state I do believe religious people should have the ability to serve and hire people based on their religious beliefs.
As you mentioned, some Christians interpret the bible in a peaceful manner while others view it as aggressive and violent.
As Sam pointed out in the video ...it only takes one blowjob.
But he needed to explain why this white dominant government system is a problem.
If these events can transpire in middle east, then why couldnt they happen here?
The cooperation between U.S and the Middle East is important to breaking down the predispositions between the two parties.
Taking a step back and comprehending that fact kind of blows me away.
Like Sam had mentioned, I frequently try to group people based on their ancestry.
I think it is important for us as humans to try and learn more about what is going on around the world because the less we know the more we contribute to this problem.
The world would certainly be a better place if everyone was able to take a look in the mirror and accept the fact that their personal way of life is no better than anybody else.
If the only human to be without sin was Jesus than those who wrote the Bible, and translated were not without flaws.
Families are forced out of their homes.
It is so easy to forget about what is going on outside of America when so many things in our country come easy to us.
He showed a picture of a mall just like ones we find here in America and he explained that many people would think they had a small, beat down mall or not even any malls at all because we judge before we really know what anything is like.
Why do they act like they never committed sins?
It is almost like we underestimate war when it is portrayed in the news.
I completely disagree with the statement when Sam says, we are moving towards Sharia.
It is important to show everyone the similarities of the two cultures.
Unless you truly regret, and wholeheartedly believe you will try to do better, it won't matter what the priest says.
When you think of some places like Afghanistan or Pakistan you think of a war zone because that is exactly what these places are.
Its different for me to imagine this because of everything we have learned.
I feel like I cant be that bad on the grand scale right?
This video does an excellent job in explaining this perspective, the people living in Afghanistan are people too.
There are to many levels to go through to pass legislation.
Furthermore, we need to then compare the histories of all religioustexts in order to truly understand the underlying metaphysical structurebetween themto show that they are truly all the same meta stories told in different manners.
These people might not even be personally involved or invested but are still pitted against each other due to this conflict.
What those people were was Christianity not my belief and I though they were very wrong and being in any way associated with them makes me sick.
Listening in class to Sam speak and show images in class makes us more aware of the world and how to take a different perspective.
Because this is so, it gives off a vibe that some Christians, not all, are basically constructing their own way of doing things that is not presented in the Bible.
Many people in this country are not religious, dont live by the Bible, and practice different faiths that dont coincide with the Bible.
For example, Sam presented the class with a list of daily problems that pop up in everyday life.
While I believe it is an important book in Christian history, I do not believe that it should be used to determine the outcome of any legal matters.
I agree that the issues that Sam brought up should be discussed, but I think there could have been a better format.
They go to work, watch television, root for their favorite sports teams, and look for love, just like we do.
He starts with a quote from Corinthians, where it clearly states homosexuals will not go to heaven.
This lesson meant a lot to me because I think it not only can really resonate with me, but really help my dad.
Instead, women are encouraged to come out and vote because leaders want as many people as they can get to participate in each years election and are looking for better turnouts each year.
I had the same reaction when Sam asked what we think when someone says 'Afghanistan.'
They wake up every day living a life in fear.
Kenneth, I too wrote about this video and I completely agree with your points.
When in reality, Muslims are very peaceful people and mean no terror to anyone.
I think he makes a good point about how the Quran and the Bible are similar when you take the time to look at what they are saying.
On one hand, the Christian religion preaches that God loves everyone equally but then why is there a checklist of criteria that must be met for someone to go to Heaven.
It was really amazing to see how Rafi has flourished with his career, family, and overall life.
Another point I wanted to bring up, was the fact that the U.S offered Basim nothing for destroying his home and killing his family members.
It is sad that Afghanis have to live their daily lives knowing that could be killed at any moment.
In that I think Sam succeeded in his lecture.
As Sam mentioned, people are trying to make a Bible-based world in the United States.
I did not know that it could actually be used for any religion, and that our country already has been using this for some time.
One of the questions that largely supported his claim was asking if they believed in sharia government.
I think that really trying to communicate with everyday people from other countries will help diminish this fear of the unknown and lead to a better chance for peace.
He gives several examples of Christian people, criminals, living by the Bible.
So, they are caught in the middle of it.
This prejudice needs to change or we will never advance as a society.
The attempt to bring religion into politics is seen too often.
Perhaps the only way we could learn that these countries are not as poor as we think would be to look into things ourselves.
Every day I wake up without worrying for my safety as I begin to embark on what's in store for the day.
I completely agree that there is a Christian homophobic agenda.
It is eye opening to realize that our core values really do not stray far from those of Muslims.
It is impossible to tell, as different people will say different things.
I think of all the American soldiers lives that are being affected by the war.
While in the Bible it might not say that whites are superior, it does not say that they are not so arguing against whether someone interpreted the Bible in the wrong way would be a pointless argument.
Like Sam says, theres no way to kill people without having a loss of life on both sides.
However, many fundamentalists just focus on the line about homosexuals and ignore the rest.
I understand that many religions do have their differences, however if these holy books that we read from and live by are more similar than different, why must we base our hatred off of them?
Instead of everyone recognizing the fact that both Islamic extremists and right-wing extremists both exist, people just choose to view the media that fits what they want to believe.
Today, now it is hard to find someone that believes and follows duties that say that homosexuals, fornicators, thieves, and more cannot go to heaven.
It is only through active reflection that you would be able to figure out a religion actually does fit you and you could learn many things by being open enough to hear their arguments.
I take comfort in the idea that I have the ability to live by my own moral code.
Is it because of the rigorous training that reminds them of Greek hazing?
Followers are confronted with the decision to follow the more conservative route or take bits and pieces of what they want to hear and read from their sacred tomes.
In real life death is permanent and respawning does not exist.
I was receptive to the teachings of Christ but also aware of passages that seemed to contradict others or were just outright ignored.
I also never understood how people could read a scripture and develop this whole other meaning than what was there.
When I think of war I don't take into consideration how much down time the soldiers have.
Although the bible does tell us about how people should live, die, marry, and divorce the bible is solely a tool for lost individuals to use as a guide to find new hope.
Any of you who have traveled to another country have probably noticed signs of racism elsewhere in the world, and if you havent then you clearly werent paying attention because there is no place in the world completely free of this problem.
But overall I think it is pretty cool to be able to tell.
Since 9/11, many have blamed all Muslims for the casualties that have surfaced since we started the war overseas.
People who are religious leaders base their entire life around their religion, usually from a younger age.
The bible is made up of multiple books from different authors.
The problem with this is people in general are a complex species and we have developed since this book was first written.
People have such a negative view on Islam, when in reality if you actually try to learn about it and understand it it is a beautiful religion.
When the Americans come in they want everyone to support them and if you dont you will most likely be captured or killed if you pose a threat.
I do not know much about Sharia, but Sam did make some interesting points about it.
With the conversation between both sides as well as the visual aid for the retold history, I think the class can agree that these lectures were very impactful.
This instructor was never told to change his teaching methods, which i believe goes to show the ignorance pertained to this law expressed by authorities in my school and most likely many others.
I am sure mothers and fathers across the nation would not like to tell people that their son came back in a body bag because of our oil interests.
However, I think that your first sentence is slightly off.
The Constitution was not written for all people.
I found it very eye opening when we learned about how similar the Quran and Bible are, and that really opened my eyes to see that our Christian radical groups are very similar to the Muslim extremists that we are taught to hate.
Prior to learning about the afghan people, it was easy to put a negative connotation with these people.
Also, it made me appreciate things better because I can only imagine myself living in Afghanistan where I only want peace but surrounded by danger all the time, while the rest of the world thinks I am involved with the evilness.
However, while I am a strong supporter of talking about race more, I realized how lucky America is that we speak on this issue at all.
In addition, it strengthens the idea that everyone has their faults.
But when it starts to radicalize and become about hating those who don't believe and those who are interpreted to be wrong that is when i have an issue with it.
To me, this was the reason I thought they were always in war with America.
As I learned more about the faith I was brought into I began to find differences in what I believed to be right, to be the way God, wanted me to live.
Not the specific things a religion has to offer, but just the moral ground it can give someone.
And because of that I think it is very important to be aware and do not judge people because not everything is as it is shown on the media.
However, I did not think of them as terrorists as most people do but more as Muslims who are still paying for the 9/11 attack.
Radical christians may, for example, spew so much hatred towards homosexuals, but be blind to the fact that they are equally guilty according to the Bible.
The moment that hit me how real this war is was when Rafi first spoke to the class.
Its crazy to think that we could easily be in the same situation as the Afghan people.
Sam then mentions a strong argument regarding Donald Trump, which can be used for other politicians.
I was surprised by LTC Garey's comments about how most of his time was spent during his tour in Afghanistan.
I also believe that for Afghans like Rafi, his exposure to America and his friendship with Sam allows him to disbelieve the single story the rest of the world has of America.
Afghanistan was probably just like how state college is.
I feel like my dads position is a very common christian perspective.
When he said this, it gave me a different view of the citizens of Afghanistan.
For this reason, I'm in favor of the establishment clause and I believe that this law should be more heavily enforced.
This connected to the message of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichies Ted talk on The Danger of a Single Story.
The reasons that I became disenfranchised with the Catholic church were problems that I saw within the organization.
It scares me to think that the Taliban were at the arrival of the US troops in that village, and yet the troops could not tell them apart from the local citizens.
Relating to another class, Rafi is one of the sharia law influencers in Afghanistan and he, to the best of my understanding, is a feminist!
How their families are missing them and wondering if theyre going to return home to them.
Knowing the above and although I understand that the Religious Freedom Bills are made to discriminate against the LGBTQ community, and that is not right I disagree with part of the example he read us during class.
That's why I think classes like Soc 119 are so important.
However, he follows up by listing off a bunch of other things that also prohibit people from getting into heaven.
How we perceive the actions of others is an important way of being able to communicate with people.
Why make a new word up when there are plenty of slang toward black people already?
I think living in the US has shaped this way of thinking for me.
It is also important to say here that this .1% difference is not limited to race but applies to all individuals.
While there are the three exceptions as to when women can request a separation, they still have nearly no say, and being a woman myself I dont know how they put up with it.
Since the war doesn't directly affect a lot of us, including myself, it is easy to just forget about it and focus on ourselves, especially since I don't know anyone that is fighting in the war.
This video suggested to me that conflicts such as these put barriers between people who could otherwise be friends.
It is so sad that his story was never on the news.
Fortunately, it does not concern me.
How could someone tell me to believe in something when they do not know the extent of it?
He was responding the same way that many have responded to racial issues that have been happening in the U.S.
That is how most people are in the United States, we, especially younger people, only think about things revolving around ourselves.
I believe all of this, the crime, the war, is all rooted in miscommunications.
Homosexuality itself is innate, a person cannot choose to be gay or straight.
When you think about war and it becomes real, you begin to feel the pain of these people because not only are the soldiers on both sides dying but the casualties of innocent lives is another tragic reality.
We should always try to fight for others even when it seems hard to do.
It's easier to assume our troops are doing the right thing by killing citizens in Afghanistan, when in reality innocent people are dying.
Sam hyped it up as being the best class of the semester, and while many good points were made and emphasized, I and those around me felt uncomfortable at times.
Nowadays, the difference is always put on the spotlight, and the similarities are buried by the medias.
I think that it is true that we kind of did become desensitized to the whole war.
Just how should the Quran or the Bible be followed?
Dr. Richards does a great job of narrating these difficult discussions, using humor to lighten up the room.
And often times, we rely on the medias perspective to form our own opinions because of a lack of knowledge.
His vision of the country had him think that the fact that he was being offered tea was a trick but it wasnt.
Also shown are pictures of city traffic jams.
Sam states that Christians only read the things that they want to read.
Even though this country is one of the largest Christian nations, there are still many who do not practice it.
I think this is an interesting point of Sam to make because I had never really thought about this because I do not use my religion in my daily life to make decisions.
It is very important to understand another peoples culture and I have recently learned that.
I enjoyed learning about their culture as well.
It makes e wonder if we were to talk more to the people there, would Americans be more reluctant to continue going to Afghanistan?
We only rely on the fact that this is happening really far away and that it might not affect us directly.
This is why I find it very hard to listen to people who use bibles or other religious literature to point out mistakes made by other people.
Rafi is truly such an inspiration for men and women worldwide, and it shows in his speeches.
There has been no stable leader, which has caused this country to be so chaotic.
Two people can be presented with the same topic, but have completely different views on it.
If people were to acknowledge the problem and agree to work towards a solution, the wounds of the past could heal and we could begin to move forward.
He is using this point to connect Christian sharia to Islamic sharia.
This is what I think Sam was getting at when he showed the Bible verse from Corinthians.
I do not think you or I have the same beliefs as them.
Sam did a great job by telling us the story of Bisham and then actually having him to speak us was a life changer.
There are people that are completely ignorant of all the other things that the Bible says ALSO very clearly.
Many of the points that you have highlighted breaks down the value of the talk.
I also agree with you that we have to find a way to cope with this religious ignorance, but interpreting religion freely or approaching it the way one desires is definitely not the solution.
However, I just think that even the thought of using the Bible as a platform for decisions, especially in law, is kind of ridiculous for the country we live in.
Except for your random recession, or the dreaded depression we have a generally stable ecosystem here.
However in this video Sam is able to demonstrate how this law is not a very good way of maintaining order.
I think this because religion is very general, there are no true specifics in it which leaves it up to interpretation.
I think a lot of us, who is not involved in the war has a lack of understanding of the Afghanistan.
I'm not saying that Jesus or Mohammed would approve of the acts of ISIS, the LRA, or the KKK, but could you blame those hate/terror groups for interpreting their respective holy books that way?
So why are we so quick to judge all Muslims on the radical actions of a small group?
I feel like we are brought up to believe that these people are all horrible and even the citizens of these countries are the enemy.
There are going to be radical people in every religion.
But if the smallest differences are enough to instill doubt and fear into other groups, what will it actually take to avoid the pattern of hypocrisy.
Anyways, I grew up knowing about the bible and hearing about it on Sunday mornings.
Had I been raised in the same situation, I would most likely follow Sharia law and view other types of Law as very strange.
Sam talked about, we have a vision built into our minds as Americans that paints an unfair picture of Muslims.
I found myself having to agree with things that I did not truly believe.
This leads to hate group, racism, etc.
The way Sam compared the Bible and the Quran was extremely effective evidence that the religions are more similar than people think.
These issues cannot remain unresolved forever if we wish to make progress.
It does not say one is worse than the other, but they still chose to single out this one piece of criteria.
They have many of the same things as we do here butI think that the mediamainly focuses on the negative so we do not get a chance to see the way of life that the Afghans live so it's not as easy to gain empathy for them.
I think that while it is definitely important to talk about poverty in other places, we also need to discuss the poverty in our own country.
But I cannot even wrap my head around the thought of how strong a bond must form from surviving a war together, not only for while theyre there but when they come home too.
I just grew up thinking that Afghan people were bad because we were fighting them and I did not even know what for.
I am fortunate enough to not wake up and stress about being killed by an act of war.
This is only because as a culture we tend to not let some things go, especially those that affect us personally.
Why would I want to walk around calling myself a believer in a religion that I don't agree with?
I was truly honored and privileged to have him, such a brave, heroic man, come to our class to talk to us.
In hearing this lecture, I gained two very valuable insights into the War on Terror and the people involved.
To his surprise the culture shock he experienced resulted in a positive outcome as he was taken aback by the hospitality.
He also talked about how he learned how generous the people of Afghanistan are.
It doesn't make sense to me.
The media only makes it seem like THEY are evil, even though most citizens of those countries are just normal people with families and jobs and a normal life, just like Basim.
Thus, it is the responsibility of every individual to educate themselves on the history of human kind so that, perhaps, we could all improve our sight.
I grew up in a diverse area where it was common to see people of all backgrounds, so I was taught that we are all equal.
You cannot simply force everyone to agree with you religions values and ways to live life because there are so many different religions you can be a part of!
I tend to formulate my morals independently from the Bible.
I also have family members who were/are in the military.
A great deal of children have been killed by American soldiers because of the absence of cultural bridges between the two cultures.
I took a world religions class my first semester in college and was first introduced to all of the similarities and differences between religions there, but I sometimes forget about them and talking about it and Sharia Law brought back some points Ive thought of before.
It has also made me aware of my identity.
When Sam asked how many of us violated the bible based on the actions he described, I could not believe that only one person raised their hand.
This is an example of interpreting the Bible differently and placing more value on one segment over another.
When people mention Afghanistan, personally, the first thing I think of is war.
This fact, in my opinion, makes said radical groups in the wrong.
I don't know how I lived 19 years believing that all of Afghanistan looks as it does in the movies American Sniper or Saving Private Ryan.
I cannot imagine fearing walking out of my own front door and not knowing whether today will be my last day to live.
In general, every religion believes in a god or many gods and the general idea is to be a good civilian.
But we need to do better than that.
These stories are narrated by people that were close to the prophet (pbuh) such as his wife Aisha.
Whoever or whatever you believe in, whether it be God or Allah or someone else, would not, in my opinion, support religious conflict.
The civilians in Afghanistan interact with the American soldiers quite often and that is surprising to me because I would feel conflicted because the Americans can easily be seen as invaders.
I appreciate how you said that as Americans we are fortunate that we dont see war from a first-person perspective.
How does this belief make sense?
I agree with you that Christianity is best viewed as a suggestion of rules to follow, but the problem I had in church was that preachers claimed that their interpretation of the Bible should be taken as a literal guide to life.
It also gave me a glimpse of what kind of people they are in Afghanistan.
I wish him the best and I hope Sam has him in class again before the semester ends.
The video I have chosen to discuss was titled Christian Sharia in America.
I never understood how that was possible and once I got old enough I started to question what they were doing and I would get punished.
While there are many instances of white terrorism, it is not brought up in the same way as Muslim or Islamic terrorists.
It is also a shame that some people see a man from the middle east and automatically believe that they are a potential threat.
I've always heard of the training process and what needs to be done as a military, but it was so sad to know that they are never taught to learn and understand the new country they are stationed at.
It made sense when he spoke about going through similar experiences as soldiers and bonding from those moments with them.
Sam does a great job showing his students different perspectives on an issue.
There is little to no talk about the civilian lives in Afghanistan that are affected.
Do not be deceived, homosexuals may not inherit the kingdom of God.
There are many different religious books and saying that a single one is the way the people in that country, no matter their religion, should be governed in my opinion seems very wrong.
I have never been around someone who has been to Afghanistan and experienced their culture first hand.
Meaning that the person back then might have had put their personal beliefs into what they wrote.
Dr. Richards lecture brought up a difficult question: how do you rectify the hypocrisy of these documents?
We usually see that for smaller countries there is some foreign intervention that is required.
Even when that same passage condemns the lives of those same people preaching the passage.
Also, I think that using the term Black Devil is harsh, to say the least.
I disagree completely with what Sam was doing.
No one expects a war zone to look like an everyday, normal city.
Especially if they are your friends, I think it's so important to at least try to learn and understand certain points of their cultures to help us to develop the interactions with people.
But still, there are people, judges even, who read the Constitution so literally.
As far as I have seen, all of Sams lectures have taught me about new ways of how our world reflects on racial differences.
Kosher options are rare or replaced with vegetarian options, while Christians always have a suitable option during lent.
Basim said he was not angry with the US and he does not hate the American people because it was our government that had dropped the bomb.
Both sides have valid arguments on speaking too little and too much.
Having Rafi come speak in our class was a once in a lifetime opportunity that really opened my eyes to what is going on in the other side of the world and sparked my interest in learning more about Afghan culture.
I think it is super important to watch what kind of perception himself and his soldiers might give off to the civilians.
That is why I believe that neither book should try to be used to strictly crate laws for a society.
If something like this happened within our own territory it would most likely lead to World War 3, and we wouldn't be able to forgive our enemies.
On the other hand, people are always going to be offended by something.
It is important that war does not change the way the people are.
The past of the US was one built on racism and genocide, and it is something that needs to be acknowledged publicly and ratified.
The bible is the easiest to disprove as literal.
Because of this I find it difficult for us to adapt ourselves and society to the culture and views based upon the writings of those times.
There is no problem with a legislator to practice their religion in their own free time, but using religion as an influence when creating new laws could be disastrous.
For instance, it is evident that societies in places such as Iran and Sudan run on Sharia Law.
These are the type of talks that are necessary to be in classrooms.
I think its a very controversial matter, but that where I stand and I believe religion is good for people.
I don't believe that Sam was insulting towards Christianity, or even demeaning towards Christians themselves.
I enjoyed this video because it puts you in the shoes of the people who are actually there and actually have to experience these things on a daily basis.
We saw Rafi and anyone could notice that he is just as us, he has a family like you mentioned and it is very sad to see what him and his country are going thru.
People think that every religion is extreme except their own.
I believe that Christianity, just like any other religion, has the potential for radicalization and hatred.
Switching roles isn't going to solve anything right away obviously, but the idea of sheer realization can eventually lead to a better understanding of either side.
He correlates a law giving people the right to practice their religion to having a strict one religion rule.
There is but one problem with religion and it is the dogmatic element.
Strong-minded people like Rafi, who are willing to lose everything to make a difference for Afghanistan should be celebrated, and receive the utmost support from all Americans.
I get that people aren't always responsive to straight lectures, but that's not how it needed to be presented either.
It is so important that citizens of different countries converse and seek to understand one another because we are so similar in so many ways and without this realization, fear and hatred take place.
The mall previously mentioned had been bombed.
Many people think that the sharia law is no good because its associated with Islam but after hearing the lecture and Rafi I understand the basics of it.
I also agree that Christian sharia law would not work in America because of the diversity.
Is it the pledge process and how insane they are with emphasizing unity and obedience as a lesson?
I feel that you can not take a book 100 percent literally and expect to make decision and live accordingly to what its story says.
They will take out everything that agrees with their own beliefs and use it to justify their actions.
I think that many of us, including myself are blind to the way people living in these war zones live.
However, a majority of what I have heard has left me to believe that the war is fairly pointless and it would be worth saving the lives of the people currently in Afghanistan.
I had never had the chance to hear a story from someone like Basim, and it has completely changed my perspective on the Middle East as a whole.
I admit that before this class I rarely considered what happened in Afghanistan.
If in fact the divorce does follow through the man loses his estate and that just seems unfair.
Since there is no correct way to interpret a holy book, anyone can pick and choose what he or she believes the Bible/Quran/Torah etc.
I strongly disagree with this because a persons sexuality is something that a person is born with.
He gives a small background on what was going on in the picture, but the main use of this photo was to show that not all Afghani people are bad people.
This was confirmed when LTC Garey preached that most of the locals were reasonable with their concerns.
Finally, LTC Garey shows a picture of an Afghani solider who is smiling and appears to be telling jokes with his fellow soldiers.
It's basic premise is forgiveness, do right to others, and has guidelines to living everyday life.
And when it comes to the material in the bible there are many things that confuse me.
When North America was settled in, they not only mass murdered Native Americans and put them on reservations, but forcibly converted them to Christianity.
I find this interesting because you would think that with all this power that they have, that if they ask for it they get it.
I personally do not affiliate my life according to one book, but I think basing your life around the teachings of wise people long ago is reasonable, perhaps close minded, but that is something humanity may never get away from.
I didnt even know what Sharia law meant.
This is something I will have to look out for in the future.
I find it hard to believe that sharia can be used in instances of government since the quran does not cover many of the issues that government will face on a daily basis.
This viewpoint most likely comes from how media portrays war.
We automatically assume that the Afghan people are the bad guys and we just always affiliate them with war and hate.
Although the neighborhoods I lived in were predominately white, that all changed when I walked into school every weekday.
At the end of the video Sam makes a really good point when he brings up Lieutenant Colonel Richard Garey.
As also mentioned in this video, many liberals are trying to bring back religious teachings into public settings in order to support certain viewpoints.
And I realized how lucky we are to be living in the United Stated and take safety for granted.
I like how Sam brings humor and his own personal experience into the equation to try to relate and get a few laughs.
These actions are often overlooked in mainstream media, and many are willing to remain complacent instead of taking action for change.
Not that I agree with abortion and divorce and those types of topics etc, those issues are up for debate.
I began to realize quickly that Afghani's are in fact very similar to American's.
I completely agree with you, I had never taken a look at the other side of the war.
Even with everything being equal, the average employer would rather have a white man with a felony charge than a black man with a clean record, which is baffling.
Isnt that important to people, or just how our own people are going through the war?
His dedication to his work is very apparent and it is awesome to see someone who truly cares about people so much and is so committed towards creating a positive change.
War is made up of the individuals that fight in it and the individuals that live it every day.
It now confirms to me that the people over there are the same as us, most want peace and to live a happy life.
I think this is very true.
We need to take away from lecture that we should be open to other perspectives and not judge quickly about something we do not even know about.
In the past few years, speakers with a clear religious bias have been invited to speak at our school.
There is nothing saying anything on; divorce, stalking, money laundering, cybersecurity, and more.
Religion is an effective way to organize and motivate people to do what you want.
It all depends on how we were brought up.
The fact is that both the Quran and the Bible have many different interpretations and even if we decided to turn to sharia here in the U.S. the question becomes whose interpretation should be made into law?
Although, once he was able to understand the culture, his eyes were opened to a community very similar to those in the United States.
Its just certain people who take information and use it to their advantage to come up with outrageous justifications for the crazy things they do.
The fact that these are real individuals makes the idea of war a much more complicated one and forces us to think about it in a new way because the way we look at it now, its not personal at all and we just think of it as something that happens but it never affects us directly.
I assume most of these groups gain followers that are already hateful of a certain group and are told that they could use the Bible or Quran to justify the hate they already have of another group.
If all Muslims are considered terrorists because of 9/11 then how come those who claim such do not consider all Christians to be terrorists with regards to the KKK?
My grandparents are Jehovah's Witnesses and they pride themselves in living by the Bible but, they would do things that contradicted what the religion taught and then turn around and justify it with the Bible.
I failed to imagine that families of Afghan soldiers are going through the same hardships.
Critics tend to take certain paragraphs out of the book and interpret them, without reading the whole thing.
They did treat me and my brothers to homemade french toast, pancakes, and countless other breakfast foods so it was not really that bad.
Shit it might even make you happier.
Their was fear against U.S soldiers because their presence meant a constant point of stress for locals.
There is no way to know if the person being welcomed in is dangerous or planning to do something rude.
A bomb went off in the bus, and he never made it back home to his family.
When Rafi got in front of the class to speak, it hit me how real war is.
Needless to say but we don't go to that church anymore.
I am glad that Rafi came into the class because it just reminds me that people from countries we have fought are not bad people.
The next pictures again were eye opening and showed me the good people in these countries.
It is more a biography of Jesus's life rather than a way to govern a civilization.
At the end of the day, we might not always believe everything that our religion tells us, but then how could this be the precedent for our legal system?
I feel like that is a great lesson to learn, to be happy regardless, even when times are hard.
Being unable to speak your beliefs without being killed would not worth living at all.
It goes to show that one group shouldnt be targeted for how they live their life.
I think a lot of the time we forget that part about the war.
It really shows us that there is so much going on in the world outside the life we live from and sometime we take it for granted.
However, I feel like both races were somewhat victimized at times, and this unfortunately only leads to more controversy on the topic.
It is so sad to me that people are so quick to make a conclusion about a religion and are ready to go to war without truly understanding the intent of most muslims.
I understand for a lot of people this is not the case, so the activity could have been quite helpful for them.
The visuals that Sam used during class to show the positives of African Americans was something extremely interesting to me.
Its sad that the war has become a daily news for us, but not a lot of us understand it well.
It is simply what we are exposed to that shapes our views, when those are entirely incorrect.
In many cases I believe that people use religion as a explanation for their actions or beliefs, especially when being defensive.
The answer to every problem a person might face is not going to be found in these books.
He mentioned that most of his time was spent conversing with the Afghan people discussing how they could improve their lives.
It is my feeling that religion can be a label used to protect people from having original beliefs.
If people continued to follow what was written in the Bible exactly, they would be stuck in the social structure of centuries ago, which is completely different than society today.
Religion does not given people moral compasses; rather, people use religion as an excuse to do good/bad acts that they would have loved to have done anyways.
The lieutenant turned down tea with the village leader numerous times, however he did not realize that the village leader could only give him information in private.
Although both have stories and truths that help us create a deeper understanding of morality, we must realize which ones to follow and which ones to interpret because both pieces of work were created over a thousand years ago.
Seeing Rafi's family, friends, city really opened my eyes.
But in our modern world, it is increasingly difficult to live by such means.
Anyone can follow a religion blindly that another person has invented but it takes an individual to lead their own path.
They want their country to go back to how it was before all these other countries started coming in and destroying it.
Every friend we have was a stranger at one point.
I agree with what you said about Sam showing the map of the country.
But I do, and always have, considered myself a real Christian.
as mentioned by Professor Richards, the Establishment Clause is a law that states that religion cannot be integrated with ideas taught in public schools, court cases, and overall the state.
A religious leader not performing a marriage ceremony does not keep a person in that state from being married.
Certain actions make people seem like they are not apart of the religion because of thenorms of that religion.
Before this lecture, I had not really thought about the Afghanistan war from the perspective of the Afghan people.
For example, now days we can just text someone from very far in just matter of seconds as for back then it could take days, months or even years just to get a message and by changing this, it actually changes the whole connection we have as humans.
Do people even know what the Military does?
The political directive is without feeling and uses war as a way to get what they want.
This however does not mean that it should be interpreted for everything.
The fact that a man could be refused of a divorce is really quite interesting.
When people in countries such as the United States are presented with these images and videos, it is easy to be manipulated into believing that all people in that country act that way.
So hearing a man who is at more risk of being attacked than myself, made me appreciate the life I have here.
It is a collection of stories with ideas of morality and ideas of how to act in this world.
All they did was show statistics.
God created all humans so how could it possibly be fair for God to make certain people gay and then deny them the right to his kingdom.
I think a lot of people lack empathy and that is a real problem in our country.
This is seen with the most contemporary social issues, such as abortion and marriage equality.
No matter what is in any of these religious books, none of them are saying to go bring terror and death to hundreds of people simply for being different.
Because of this, I was not even baptized in the same church that I was a confirmed member of.
If I was in his spot at the time I would probably think the same thing.
I realized that many of us felt a sense of guilt for the opportunities we have and the way we live.
Rafi is no different than any of us, yet our own government completely ruined his life.
My third reason, is after taking a world literature class last year and learning how every religious book has a similar parallel.
Will it ever get to a point of peace?
Christian radicals follow many aspects of their religion to the very word, but ignore or drastically misinterpret another part in order to suit their world views.
Like you said, we could have done something similar without diving into controversies and things of that sort.
Seeing the picture off traffic was really made it seem like a normal place.
It takes a lot of effort to see what is right or wrong, and even more to decide.
I remember this lecture being one of the most mentally enlightening.
Although I do not personally condone U.S. involvement in the middle east, I do believe that we should show more empathy for foreign nations as we proceed with dealing with foreign affairs.
From what I have observed in America there is a very skewed perspective about Afghanistan and the people from there.
However, some countries have confronted their issues as well, such as South Africa.
I think for me personally, it was very impacting seeing how a lot of civilization in Afghanistan is not what I always pictured it as, and that they are just like us, trying to live a peaceful healthy life.
With no clear way of enforcing a holy book's writing into law, it would be difficult to ever agree on what should be done.
Currently I do not attend church on a regular basis.
He then continues on to get another part of the Bible which describes multiple different ways that a person cannot be allowed into heaven.
War is an unnecessary evil in today's society, it is such a large factor in our lives that it will continue to be talked about however we need to change how we discuss war and move onto focusing about the human aspect of war.
I totally had the same exact thoughts reading your response to this part of the lecture.
I think that it is insane that people believe that societies means of living should be determined by ideas that were created over one thousand years ago.
So how can I live my life now days accordingly to the beliefs and views of what is the right thing or wrong thing to do when all these factors need to be taken into consideration in order for me to decide what is an acceptable and correct way of living my life.
This is very similar to radical Islam, where members will commit terrorism or hate in the name of god.
By this they thought they were saving them but they were destroying the Native American culture.
I was always taught to forgive, love, and understand.
I like the reference you made to the U.S. constitution and how it was written with the ability to be changed to adapt to the times.
He even brings up a similar slide with information in the Quran, about how alcoholics and gamblers will not inherit the kingdom of God.
In general, I consider myself to be someone who is culturally aware and someone who respects diversity.
I think the point of this video was to show civilians that soldiers go through things that can and will change them for the rest of their lives but while they are overseas there is limited time they are actually at battle.
I think, when it comes to reading books like the Bible and Quran, you have to look at them like historical texts more than instructional texts - this is once what people followed - and try to get the big picture of what they are trying to teach.
If Maziar, a former member of the Iranian military, could be so friendly with two former members of the US military, it is hard to believe that there is so much hate between the two countries that still exists.
Hearing people like that truly disgust me.
Trump uses Christianity to form his opinions and yet Sam does mention that half of what Trump does, is not acceptable under the rules of the Bible.
People can look at it and find hatred while if you give a more modern look on the Bible you will see that it is more about acceptance and not judging others.
However, to see that an American soldier who enters a town actually gets to sit down with one of the most knowledgeable people in their community is nothing short of amazing.
And why is it interpreted in various, extremely contrasting ways?
Some people who enjoy gambling every now and then should not be crucified for doing so, as long as they are smart about it.
I feel like as Americans we feel very estranged from Afghanistan and other countries that our soldiers are in.
To go along with this quote, the bible also states that there is only one criterion that God uses to judge humans.
It was incredibly disheartening to hear about the effects of the U.S.s involvement in the middle east.
I think it is really interesting to see war from someones perspective that experiences it every day and lives a life in threat.
Just how Sam mentions in the discussion, everyone interprets the workings of the bible differently.
And as soon as I heard Rafi speak about his wife and his children, and when Bassim told the class about that horrible incident, I was mad at myself.
Though he originally wondered if the action was from malicious intent, it was soon clear that this was an act of kindness, even though Garey was a stranger.
Ordinary citizens who have no interest in the politics of war and being killed and often no one cares.
However, I'm at least grateful that we talk about the topic at all.
The civilians are the ones who are truly affected by any war but I was happy to see that Rafi was still a positive person who could share his story.
Interviewing soldiers who fought in Afghanistan shows how surprised how generous and welcoming the people are.
I thought his was a really interesting approach to viewing race and was interested in the science behind it.
Then hearing that Bassim wasn't angry was astounding.
I found LTC Garey's discussion very interesting and the stories he told were amazing.
Sam Richards also spoke upon the verse Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God?
The Bible touches on a couple of these topics briefly, but does not go into vivid detail.
They call it unprogressive, very strict about some crimes like stealing and cutting the hand.
The media never did one on one interviews to really get you in the shoes of the people that lived there.
I was honored to have Garey speak in our lecture and give us insight on what it is like to work with the Afghan people.
Some took the book and turned it into an article of war and hatred to be used to control and direct the illiterate and disenfranchised like is seen in groups like ISIS.
The media portrays them awfully, making them out to be monstrous people who's only instinct is to act on violence.
were not to be eaten.
As you said, I would have never imagined a Lieutenant having tea with an old man in a small village to get the information they needed.
The only difference is that ISIS is killing Christians.
I even began to grow in my faith as I grew older but I was still never completely sure how to understand all of it.
Looking at the entire verse, it seems obvious that most people in this country will not inherit the kingdom of God.
He would and has questioned those people on both sides with who are you to tell them they arent Christians/Muslims.
One of the things you mentioned in this about peoples identity as religious based on what they are surrounded with is something I find to be very interesting.
We have this mindset that its our job to get involved in any foreign relations that either has to do with us or something we so dearly want.
However, that is what many places in Afghanistan look like.
Generalizing groups of people is very ignorant and uneducated.
Theywere looking for something to support their thought process so they some how found it.
I think the idea of Sharia can be applied to any religion or any belief set and that was what Sam was trying to teach us.
With that being said, many do not have the same interpretations of either book.
Americans seem to have this prejudice against Afghani people, believing that they are bad people who are just trying to cause wars and perform terroristic acts.
Most of the time the Priest would explain to the congregation that though one can take the laws practically, it was more important to take the message beyond its face value.
I really agree with what you are saying here.
I find it crazy that he says he misses it over there.
This is done all around the world within each different, but not really that different, religion.
Before that day in class, I had still seen afghanistan as a poor country, more like a war zone than a place where people carried out their everyday lives.
It is so common that is happens within the same states but different regions.This is also similar to people who are from New York.
But I know exactly what you mean - trying to decipher how to live your life off of ancient books is super confusing and no one is ever going to interpret it exactly the same.
I think interpretation is where most people get religions twisted.
The only differences are several tweaks, the characters, and the culture that it supported at the time.
Maybe if we do this it will help alleviate some of those common misconceptions that are seen.
Sam attempts to unpack this assumption by bringing out a Quran, which is the so-called basis for Sharia law, and describing what the Quran actually is.
He states that he got to know the people who lived there and built a connection with them which taught him that they are people too.
Having total disagreement due to religion is something that will not be beneficial when trying to run a country and keeping the peace within the country.
I also believe that as interpreters of the Bible, we get tripped up on some of the details instead of seeing the larger picture.
It helped him get the information he was looking for and it also helped the village.
However, well traveled civilians usually have a good sense of other cultures as well.
And it was even more interesting to hear about just how similar that the Muslim faith is to Christianity, and honestly many other religions.
We as Americans haven't had to deal with war going on in our own backyard.
Too many people suffer and are affected by war for this to continue to be unnoticed.
The different interpretations from different people would cause more problems than it would fix thus to live by the teaching in the book would be fine but governing by them is something that wouldn't seem to work.
I am a nineteen year old girl who knows little to nothing about war.
Or in other words, as Sam said, knuckleheads.
When it comes to overlying major issues I think it is smart to fall back on the bible to realize what is actually right and wrong.
It is common of us to feel mostly safe in our neighborhoods and communities, that it is hard to understand how someone in another country could feel the total opposite.
They are successful because of their ability to engage with other people of other cultures.
Speaking with Bassim really made war real as we all learnedabout another countries viewpoint on the US.
I really like how you worded this and couldn't agree more.
As much as I do believe in things the Bible states, I also disagree with a number of beliefs it states.
However, both religions have the challenge to relate them to current day issues.
Like we already know White Supremacy is a thing.
The answer varies because people put more meaning to religion than it would be expected.
It is hard to believe the incredible amount of poverty there is in the United States because it is basically hidden from us.
Just like any other religious book the Quran has basic common sense rules to follow that make sense to correlate with laws.
No matter how much we try and change the system of racial hierarchy, it will truly never be broken.
When the word Afghanistan is mentioned, it provokes images of violent people with bombs strapped to their chest trying to kill Americans.
There were many facets to the bible that I didn't agree with, or at least interpreted far differently than what I was being told.
This is a perspective that rapidly grew post 9/11.
The world that we all live in is not the same one that existed when these texts were written thousands of years ago.
Its really fascinating to learn about the rules and regulations in other religions Im not familiar with, and learning a little bit about the Quran really makes you realize how some Christians demonize Islam.
White people do not understand the reality that black people have to face everyday, and by reversing the roles of the white person vs. the black person, it gave me a better understanding of the continuous struggle that people of color still face today.
I come from a regular suburban town, so I live in a bubble where my only concept of war is the fact that my grandfather fought in World War II and that we seem to always be at war.
Many people do not realize the damage it does to people.
I do not understand how their worlds view can be so focused in one part of the book, instead of the whole thing.
It is difficult to realize, but Christians misinterpret the bible just as often as Muslims.
Because of the size of the Quran, it is impossible for it to contain a guideline for dealing with every type of potential crimes.
I found this whole conversation very interesting because I grew up knowing that we were in war with them and that they have hurt a lot of good people.
I am so grateful for Basim to take the time out of his day to speak to our class.
Morality differs from person to person and their interpretations so when one person reads a passage they may interpret it entirely different, so how do you form a government based solely on the quran or even the bible.
The statistics may just seem like numbers on a graph or charts, but it is real people, with real lives and livelihood that are suffering because of fighting.
I found this segment to be very interesting because I am a Christian myself.
One video that I thought to be exceptionally interesting, was the one about the Establishment Clause.
A few individuals inside a car thought that it was religiously correct to run over a group of protesters in the street.
Basically what Sam was talking about was how people would like to bring Christian Sharia law to America and he highlights the flaw in this.
I love how this class is constantly giving me reasons to challenge my beliefs and get me thinking about new ones.
I, too, had only ever been taught values of love, peace, and acceptance.
By forcing someone to perform a marriage ceremony that conflicts with their views is not fair to that person who has dedicated their life to what they believe, whether or not we agree with it.
How could we possibly know what God truly meant?
It also does not make sense to me why you would ask a religious leader to perform your marriage ceremony if he/she was so against your views that they would not do it willingly.
I like how Sam used the comparison with the Christian religion and Muslim religion to show that the books are morally the same.
Jesus is described as a simple, but magical man who has the power of god and lives humbly as a peasant wandering across the land spreading his message.
Another thing that I was clearly misinformed of was the actual meaning of Sharia Law.
We do not always realize that Afghanis are real people too and a lot like us in many ways.
I frequently get asked if I am religious.
Many of the aspects are touched on in the old testament, but to a lesser extent.
How can you call a group of people sinners for being born with something they cannot change?
Hearing many of Rafis stories was extremely eye opening for me as I never really thought of the real people living in war zones.
Hearing Rafi talk about his life in Afghanistan, his children, his work is really eye opening to me.
This in turn provides opportunities to learn and gain perspectives from a wide range of people with unique backgrounds and cultures.
So, I get the idea of this exercise, but also am somewhat confused by it.
That goes for everything life, so just because this sharia law is in another country we shouldn't listen to what others have to say about it until we can let go of prejudices and see what its all about for ourselves.
No one wants to feel stupid.
How there are so many good people in that part of the world but all we see is the complete opposite.
The growing issue of civilians being affected is very apparent in Afghanistan.
I feel as if people in the United States should be getting divorced less and trying to make their marriages work more than they do.
If that is the case how did people just make their own way to follow it and think that that was ok.
I think that some people just use it as an excuse so they can do horrific things and make them feel as though they are doing the right thing, which is just despicable.
I always thought of traveling as going to pretty places.
People are not informed on situations like this that put innocent people in danger.
The line just becomes blurred when it has a name you associate with yourself on it.
I think me reacting negatively to those things before I actually heard the full laws is the exact kind of bias that Sam wanted to make us aware of.
I think there is a lot of power in knowing about other religions and cultures that you are not accustomed to and that is where walls and barriers begin to be tore down when you can relate to a person from their standpoint and figure out why they are doing something you are not familiar with.
I firmly believe that nobody truly knows what happens when we pass away, and to prosecute others and discriminate against people who share different beliefs than you is just ridiculous.
She told me that I shouldn't tell people that I'm arabic or Muslim because she was so afraid of the Islamophobia going on.
This exercise really showed how physical characteristics are simply a product of your environment and depend on geography.
The fact that many Americans often associate all Muslims with extreme terrorism is completely unfair.
It really sucks that people that are just like us have to live in this constant state of fear everyday.
Personally, this has never really been a big issue in my life.
It is really hard to imagine living my own life in constant fear.
In another discussion, Sam put a verse from the bible that basically said those who are homosexuals will not go to heaven.
I also believe it comes down to personal preferences, and we like people for the little things, that we, ourselves, may not even be aware of.
I think in order to understand other country we have to experience what they go through because it's really easy to judge from the outside, but we don't really know what's going on in the inside.
I used to think like the rest of the public that the Afghan people are always in wars and the image of them in public has nothing to do with peace.
Moreover Poor and young children who did not get to experience a proper childhood get murdered.
Not only did it cause me to appreciate the fact that this war isn't happening on our own land, but it made me empathize with the innocent people who are dying from this stupid war.
I thought about it if it was applied to the United States and if a group such as the KKK was to attempt to try to follow this example.
The next picture he showed us was the shopping center in Kabul where it was bombed.
They believe that in order to be more committedto their religion they have to take actions full of atrocity.
It is so scary and upsetting to see the images of these little girls, knowing that they are living in the middle of war and they must be terrified.
Thus, I truly wish society would stop placing false assumptions on groups of people before learning about their way of life.
I'm sure many of the Christians who don't believe in homosexuality have performed sexual acts before marriage or drank or smoked yet all they can focus on is what doesn't apply to them.
LTC Garey even stated, Most of the times I was working with the opposing side!
They should be recognized for who they actually are and for the changes and impact they have had in our society today.
I never thought it would be important to know about the opposing side's culture or different types of recruiting tactics, however after listening to Rich it is clear that this is an important part of the job.
It is often that we stereotype the people of a country involved in war.
I was taught to always turn to the Bible for answers to what seems to be more difficult questions.
LTC Garey began his story by saying he had his unit had been searching for a high up Taliban member for quite awhile and had been unable to locate him.
It made me see how similar they are and that the only reason they viewed as being completely different is the public perspective on how people interpret them.
The Afghan people are welcoming and peaceful people that are misrepresented in our world.
Prosperity should not be limited to citizens of a certain skin color, this principle is at the foundation of this country yet the institution fails to uphold its promises.
However, it is not their fault because they did not have a specific set of rules to follow.
Another thing he showed us was a graph where we could see that each year there are more Afghan civilians that die because of the war.
I agree that when Sam showed us pictures of real people there and told us their story, my whole perspective changed.
I came out of this class however seeing a striking similarity in Rafis talk and Bassims talk.
I also thought this clip was interesting because I personally was unaware of the specifics of the Establishment Clause.
One person might consider themselves a servant of god, while another person might only go to church on Christmas.
To this day, I remember him telling me a story about how he would lay awake at night unable to comprehend the horror he saw and how he could hear numerous men crying softly in their bunks.
Then seeing him live on the screen left me speech less.
But, when innocent civilians over there die, it is often not heard of.
I was more than once that I was amazed by how people have one view of something and wouldnt even consider taking a second look from another angle.
Afghan people are just humans like we are, but people fail to understand that due to the fact that all they hear is negative comments when they are growing up.
Not only did the war affect people physically but also civilians started experiencing mental and psychological problems due to the horrific experiences and heartaches they had to go through daily.
He tells us that they are real people living in Afghanistan while the war is going on.
Have you heard about the Dead See Scrolls?
I also found it very interesting the way he broke down the literal sense of the bible's verses, in which they state who will not go to heaven.
Like you said it is unfortunate that when the US first went to Afghanistan the people had a hazy idea about what Afghanistan really is including some of the troops that had to go there.
It is safe to say that religion has caused more wars and deaths than any other issue.
I feel I am more accepting unlike my grandparents.
We as Americans dont realize that there are people out there living their lives just like us.
I know I am only preaching here, but it is true.
I thought it was fascinating to compare Christianity and Islambut even more amazing was pointing out how people who are radical (including the alt-right and isis) in both religions are not truly following what the text is saying, rather they are just picking and choosing what they want to follow.
The honest truth is that one person cannot live their entire life trying to follow the writing of somebody else, especially when the book cannot possibly provide advice for every little aspect on a person's life.
To lose your wife, your kid, your brother, even your dog, in one fatal day, I cannot even imagine the heartbreak.
In regard to abortions, womens rights, these are areas where people continue to disagree.
Although I used to live abroad and have encountered many different cultures, I unfortunately still pictured Afghanistan as a war-torn desert with little civilization.
Rafis friend was murdered for doing work, much like Rafi, that promotes peace in Afghanistan.
It is kind of embarrassing when you think about it.
Politics and the Christian religion are perceived as tightly intertwined when observed from outside.
Love takes many different forms and I support everyone one.
That is why is so important for not only us, as students of this class to open our eyes but society in general.
All I think about is violence but thats because thats what I was taught growing up.
With that being said, I have always wanted more insight into what they truly do, not just when they join, but specifically overseas.
I think that it's sad that his daughters have to grow up living in a war zone.
I also thought it was different that there were four types of divorce that Rafid talked about.
I completely agree with Colonel Richard that we easily assume that the people living in conflict zones always are prepared to fight ,carrying weapons or are illiterate, poor and know nothing other than war ,because then we can justify it.
It's something we discussed at length during lab the past two weeks as well.
I totally agree with before this lecture I did not have a very good understanding of Middle Eastern culture.
I thought that soldiers did what they had to do in combat and that was it!
We are all humans & I believe that we should stop putting labels on those people just because of their ethnicity.
The way the war is displayed in our news makes it seem like we are hated by the civilians.
I think that there are a couple reasons society has this perception.
What is the point of trying to make peace when there are always going to be more wars?
I personally have never read the bible even though I'm a Christian, but I never knew that the statement that gay people won't go to heaven is also included in the same sentence as thieves, fornicators, drunkards, extortioners, and sodomites won't get into heaven either.
Or does interpretingtext differently really matter when claiming your religion?
Sam showed us a graph that counted the number of military personnel deaths comparing U.S. workers and Afghan workers.
She was afraid of people mistreating me the way she was mistreated following 9/11.
Who wants to watch the news and listen about how many people are killed everyday?
Again, I was wrong; Christians and Muslims do believe in a lot of the same things.
We might not be able to stop the war single handedly but together it may be possible.
We should have a strong ambition to give every person a chance and genuinely accept how others live everywhere.
Being an atheist there is now way I would be able to live my life and follow my ethics by the words of the bible.
I think a lot of it has to do with how our media portrays the war and Afghanistan in particular.
There are radicals everywhere, and to assume that the majority of a faith follows the same beliefs as them would be wrong.
I think that in some situations race is brought up way too much, but then not enough at the same time.
In this class I noticed that maybe Americans do talk about race more than other countries.
Overall, I think the biggest thing to take away from this video is that people today will use certain hate groups as an example to represent a certain religion as a whole.
What I took most out of this lecture is thatdespite how foreign so many places around the world may seem compared to the United States, the people are just like us.
I don't know if I'd offer a military personal to tea if they were part of the reason friends and family are being killed as war casualties.
This is also where radical Christians make their claims, while radical Muslims do the same with the Koran.
I say this because deep down inside of myself I really feel like I am a Christian and I enjoy the Christian faith.
Both have the same ideas but are interpreted by each religion in completely different ways.
This is genuinely upsetting, and to be honest I do not know what it will take to put an end to all of this.
I think this thought process is false and should not be used in modern society.
This then allows them to make larger strides while there because they are not just fighting physically but mentally as well.
I find it very hard to talk to them about religion, but the one thing I've learned is that everything they believe in isn't going to change anytime soon.
I agree, and I think it's not only America but any human being.
He also referenced his religion playing a role in his life after the accident, saying how he practices forgiveness and exiling hate.
On top of all this the people of Afghanistan have to deal with ISIS, that's why Rafi is an incredible human being.
When we think in that manner then it is okay for us not to care.
Radical Islamism in this way can be a convenient evil to piece together for American Christiansas Muslims worship a religion built on the literal word of god, thus it is clear how radical activism could spread and be seen as just misguided people with an evil and unchanging idea.
The bible has multiple stories and teachings that can be left up to interpretation.
There are so many kind and innocent people who arent shown because the media controls what is aired.
To me, I think learning a foreign language is an amazing experience.
Overall, Richs passion for what he did for so long was inspiring.
This lecture really drew my attention to the way Christianity has dominance in America.
I made uneducated assumptions that this is how the majority of Muslims behaved and that those were their beliefs.
Without differences, we would be sheltered and would not be able to survive in the real world.
He is essentially fighting the Taliban, who rule over villages and impose Sharia law on the Afghani people.
They could be thinking to step up their efforts and maybe if they were violent enough they would be heard out.
As a society, we have to grow to become more accepting and welcoming, and I think in certain situations religious beliefs can cause quite a divide.
When he stated this it really caught my eye, because many citizens, even myself, forget that these soldiers are people just like us.
Shouldnt we be allowed to express ourselves the way we want to?
Sharia Law is generally seen as a negative thing in our society especially by politicians.
War affects real people, it ruins real places and devastates real families.
The name of this video was, War Affects Real People and Sam definitely made this clear throughout this video, and class.
The lack of understanding of the Afghan culture has delayed the rescue of the village.
I think it really inspiring that muslim and Afghan people can overlook the hate and not let it consume them.
If we all try to learn and understand each other, there will not be as much conflict going on in the world.
He showed pictures of different places in Afghanistan, and while it may be a poor, war torn country, it doesnt mean the civilians mean any less than they do anywhere else.
It is not seen due to the fact that the war in Afghanistan and other events overshadow them.
From the media's point of view this is only seen as a good thing and they hide the fact that civilian death rate in Afghanistan is continuously rising.
I also thought it was interesting that in the Muslim laws, spouses need a reason for divorce and that none of these reasons involved not loving their spouse anymore or having feelings for someone else.
We are so blind to what is really going on over there that we forget to separate the civilians from the issue at hand.
I have experienced the different questions people can ask about the religion, and the hate that comes along with it.
I also believe that the divorce rate will continue to rise throughout history as our lifespans increase.
As americans we tend to not think about what is going on in the rest of the world.
Violence is accelerating at an all time high.
I had always assumed other religions preached different moral and ethical values than that of Christianity, so it was interesting to me to see that they are not all that different.
Radical Christianity is talked about much less, but it is happening in this country every day.
I personally believe that using the bible or the quran as a basis for your life and the decisions you make is ok, but not to the point where one seems to be grasping for information or interpretations that arent there.
However, Rafi's children are being raised directly in a war zone.
It takes a class that nearly has 800 students and makes it smaller and encourages discussion among one another in the best way.
I think part of the reason why its so difficult for Americans to realize the reality of what life is like in Afghanistan because we never see what their day-to-day life is like in the media.
The pictures Sam showed of Afghanistan helped to show that it is an average place with normal people, just like in America, which I've never thought about.
The fact that both religions have had their share of fights and killings is very devastating.
What Drives You to do what You do?
I feel that the internet in a way though is causing us to unfairly generalize groups of people in both religion and race.
After knowing about Dylann Roof and how he went into a church and shot people, how is it that people have the audacity to denounce other peoples beliefs?
Some christians or muslims only read the things they want to read, there is not many people going to heaven.
I think something that has a large role in the way that the Muslim religion is portrayed in America is the media.
I feel like this really fits into what Sam talked about in class.
Some got used to the conditions and believe that they are being protected that way.
A reporter went to a sort of rally that was happening and the guy giving the speech was translating the Quran.
We see an article about immigrants coming to the US and some people will then view them as freeloaders.
I also agree that the Bible cannot explain everything about the world to us.
I feel like it is time that we see something other than people with guns and terrorizing.
Thousands of civilians lose their lives; however, most of them remain hopeful and faithful that prosperity and freedom will return to their country.
Justine, I felt the same exact way as you did coming into this lecture when this discussion and then when I left the classroom.
People do not feel that sodomy or fornication are such drastic sins because they are more regular.
I did also know that other acts like fornication, thievery, drunkenness, and others were considered not right by the bible.
I was also so inspired by Basim in the way that he overcame his anger and does not blame the United States.
I am going to talk about the video The Importance of the Military to Know Other Cultures today.
As you mentioned, they are real people.
I am nineteen years old and have never been on a plane.
I am like the majority of my fellow Americans in that I only associate Afghanistan with fighting.
I also was taken back by Sam's comparison of Sharia Law to the Old Testament, because this really showed how ridiculous the idea of using a holy book for a set of modern day laws today.
Even if it were more recent you cant possibly hope to contain that much guidance and information in a single book.
I then took it to a smaller scale and began thinking about just random places I have visited recently.
Otherwise, you can not have any expectation of safety.
Nevertheless, Christians across the world still believe in the legitimacy of our religion and become defensive when people speak ill of our belief system.
It was extremely heartwarming to listen to the gentlemen from the army speak about his experiences with the Afghan people.
Having Rafi and LTC Garey in class to speak did help with achieving that goal and I am thankful we were given that opportunity.
I was drawn to this video over other because I found it interesting just how similar the Quran and Bible are.
There clearly is still racism today, but our generation should be putting a stop to the racist talk and teach equality to the future of America.
I have only heard of Sharia Law being associated with Islamic faith and that it is the understandings that guide one on the path to heaven, but can be very traditional and includes harsh punishments in order to establish law in our system.
I understand that war is much more complex, but that makes it that much more important to start educating in school on these topics.
My answer to your question is simple, I am not worried about the increase of biracial couples.
One thing you said about all the presidents being the same religion is actually pretty interesting, and I also thought about that myself quite a bit.
I do not know if personally I would have the courage, if put in the same situation as him.
This is something that the TV news channels and newspapers do not report.
It is up to us to look further into what we see on the newsand to understand that the people of Afghanistan, amongst other places are just normal people.
Religion classes strayed from the typical lecture format and focused on student-centered discussions where my peers and I were encouraged to question and criticize fundamental Catholic doctrine.
I just think that it's very hypocritical that people take certain parts of the bible that correspond with their beliefs and preach them, but fail to take into account other parts that they're guilty of doing as well.
I was shocked that the one student did meet all the requirements.
Overall, I found your response to be super insightful.
I think it is better for myself that I am now aware of the teachings of the Sharia Law because this way if people look on this negatively I can defend it and say how is it actually different than Christianity?
For sixteen years, the United States has been fighting in this war.
Sharia to me is this code of conduct, but through open interpretation and adaptation, it can make followers negatively adherent.
Once again I had never pictured someone from Afghanistan(especially a woman) who could look and dress just like me, and just like you said all these people have hopes and dreams and they really are no different from you and me.
Thinking in that mentality, it was powerful to consider how much reasoning and control one book could have on our lives.
I always find it amazing how similar the two religions are and yet people still think the two religions are very different from one another.
When Sam said that Rafi regularly gets death threats and was told to get an armed guard, it really made me upset.
Maybe people think that race is talked about too much because too often in the news we see stories of racism and hatred.
I think presenting it this way was very interesting.
We as a country need to educate ourselves on different peoples of the world.
How do we know someone did not just make it up for how they felt we should be living.
When I think about Afghanistan, I think of conflict and fighting mainly because there has been a war going on for almost two decades.
In the United States, there are many rules and regulations that as citizens and people living here are expected to uphold, but many religions also how rules and regulations that to be a good follower we are expected to up hold as well.
But the overall population hates the war and wants it to end in order to provide safer lives for themselves, families, and children.
For myself, I always pictured them as being a little violent given the fact that they are a country who has been in war for a long time.
Everytime I walk out of this class, I realize how ignorant I am.
It is an interesting tactic that I did not know soldiers did and to me it makes doing what they do a lot more fascinating because it is not just about combat and violence like it is portrayed.
Im sure a large part of it is how her parents act around her but I wonder how being exposed to more of these issues might start to change her mind.
I think Hollywood also plays a role in this misconception we often have about war, especially this specific war.
What he is doing is not only appreciable but astonishing in a way as well.
I mean there are broad similarities but I never noticed the subtler ones that Sam brought to light during class.
I think the instinct is to be nervous about women being trapped in their marriages, but if the state of your marriage has to fulfill a prescribed set of issues for the divorce to be legitimate, I wonder if that ever makes couples stay together that would otherwise get divorced in America, and perhaps settle their differences?
Civilians have it engraved in their mind that soldiers just fight, fight, fight until the end of combat.
Also like you said, Hollywood definitely shows a horrible picture for Afghan and it's people.
I was raised in a Christian family and had heard the passage before.
Our lovely government prints Christian sentiments on everything from money to historical documents, and In God We Trust has become the official motto of the United States.
Everyone was raised differently, has different beliefs and cultures so its understandable that everyone is not going to agree with one another or even understand each others cultures.
Of course, the school said absolutely not because they did not want to favor them over other students.
The media fails to show the most beautiful parts of this country.
The choice of ending your response with a question was very powerful and made me think.
I also chose this video because I thought it was amazing.
I agree with you when you talked about how we have this preconceived notion that soldiers travel to our enemys nation and experience conflict, and come back unstable because that is what many movies make us believe.
We should receive news about the families that are there and want nothing to do with war.
We tend to avoid and ignore harsh realities and just focus on our own.
No they are never going to get used to such a life, they dont support it but that has become their lives.
It is unheard of in the United States to invite random people into your home and prepare them food and tea.
I find myself questioning if the way I interpret the Bible is the correct way.
In my opinion It can be hard to humanize a man with a gun on his hip when you see the lives of people just like you dying around you.
Both of them were very well spoken and especially Hayden left me with a different opinion on race and sports.
People who have different lives and maybe even people who have experienced a war like environment.
I am also Christian and I found it really interesting how closely our beliefs and values really are.
This makes me realize how incredibly lucky I am.
No one ever really gets to hear how the people living there are affected by what is going on.
I think more people should be able to have this conversation with any solider so they know what is really happening when soldiers travel to other countries.
It is a way to deteriorate certain subcultures.
I agree that people should not be afraid of new ideas, especially those that challenge ones own beliefs.
The gray areas of the Bible cause these grievances to take place.
Also, I think the way you interpreted this segment of class was interesting because it is amazing how we have this idea of what war is, but hearing this side from a solider is incredible.
As a Jew, I have never read the bible, but I had a idea from my experiences in life and people who I have been friends with that the bible was a book of teaching from God that told us how to live our lives in order to reach heaven and get back to God and Jesus.
Their views are unacceptable now, I still sometimes fight with my grandma about this.
He even talks about how he got suspicious when the elder of that village offered him tea.
I would be so afraid to be always living in danger.
There will always be those who are uneducated, poor, or both that find a sense of purpose in becoming radicalized.
I think the picture really emphasized the whole point of that class's lecture: these are real people with families, hopes, and dreams.
Kristine, I totally agree with what you are saying about the war.
Not every Mexican sell drugs or eats beans.
I also found LTC Garey's story about the village elder inviting him in for tea very interesting.
Especially in western culture, we are very open to more stuff that these books would probably consider sinful.
My parents are very traditional and we tend to have debates over current issues such as race, LGBTQ, or the afterlife.
Clearly, the bombings in his country have significantly impacted his life to the point that is extremely difficult to talk about.
His family was murdered, I could cry just thinking about it.
As the soldier recounted the first time he went to Afghanistan to eliminate the Taliban, I saw how detrimental and even stressful the lack of understanding a persons culture can be.
By having more interracial families, we are become a more open and accepting society.
Through taking required classes such as World Religions and Hebrew Scriptures, my worldview widened as I was compelled to compare and contrast elements of different faiths against my personal beliefs.
Throughout my time at church it was always apparent that religions differed and that people from many different religions thought differently.
This gives me a sense of humanity towards them and makes me wonder why we continue to use force when we should be trying to create stronger ties with the people of Afghanistan.
Even if someone doesn't agree with a certain opinion, its beneficial to be exposed to differing perspectives.
Here in America we can live peacefully and not have to think about anything that goes on anywhere else.
I rarely ever think about the innocent civilians that live in fear and danger every day.
So I too thought this lecture was eye opening and really put things into perspective.
However, there are a lot of aspects about the Christian religion that I really do not agree with and it is hard for me to accept some of the principles of the Bible.
Who says that one person or one group of people can determine the correct way to follow these ideals?
When Sam asked the class what came to mind when we would think about people from Afghanistan, I can confidently say the majority of the class had the wrong idea about them and their culture.
This was particularly evident when it comes to white peoples ability to give black people equal opportunity as white people.
I believe many more people would care about ending the war in the Middle East, if they understood the affect that it is having on the people who live there.
After hearing the Colonel talk about his time in Afghan and living with the people there, I realized that everything that happened in that class was a true representation of who the Afghan people are.
It is easy to put different groups of people into little boxes and that all we think.
Our generation is debatably too comfortable with the war going on there.
By flipping the participants races the flaws and redundancy in each argument become more obvious.
Rafi is doing a completely selfless act by looking out for what he thinks will lead to a better future for his country and his family.
Unfortunately, things like this never get brought up in the media today.
I do not believe in a right way to do anything.
I agree 100% with what you said.
So many questions unanswered with no possible way of putting down a definitive argument using solely contextual evidence.
I believe that it is of upmost importance that we begin to recognize the people of Afghanistan as humans, to better educate ourselves on the goings on of the world outside our own country, and to cure this ignorance, which we all seem to be suffering from.
I've never been around someone who looked Muslim that made me feel uncomfortable.
The war continued destroying lives in Afghanistan and has caused economic, financial and social losses for everyone around the country.
I really enjoyed how Sam began class by giving us the background of how the two formed a friendship.
I realize, now, that those people do not hate and do not want to fight.
It goes to show the image we have of the world.
There is a military man who had been on multiple tours and then a native Afganistan person.
Not only are innocent Afghans and American soldiers dying because of this war, but Afghan kids and families are dying.
Its crazy to think that he can have so much positivity and acceptance towards what happened to him.
Although these Taliban members do so much harm, it is shocking to see that they can be caring about LTC Garey and his family and not lash out in the face of the enemy.
I knew you had to wait some time I just didnt think it was only a couple years.
For example, the antisemites who march with confederate flags holding tiki torches.
We get trapped inside of a bubble and forget about the rest of the world.
In class, we had two gentlemen, Rich and Raffi, come to our class and discuss what life is like on a daily basis in Afghanistan and answer questions about their time there.
I think that it is sad that Lieutenant Colonel Gary had to explain, and then give examples to support, that the people of Afghanistan are so similar to the people here in the United States.
There is an abundance of poverty in America, yet as Americans we focus on those who are wealthy.
It really makes me appreciate living in America where I am able to feel safe for the most part and happy with where I live.
Seeing pictures of cars in a traffic jam, and a shopping mall with a beautiful interior clearly was not what I was expecting whatsoever.
Overall, your point regarding stopping right winged terrorism rather than just stopping islamic terrorism is something that needs to be considered by the administration.
I really like what you had to say.
Sam brought Rafi in to talk to us about his personal life and how he goes about living his life through this stress.
It ended up that our trip had to be ended 3 days early but I will never forget my experience in Israel.
I pray that Rafi and other Afghans dont lose hope for peace.
I would be interested to know what the divorce rate is in Muslim countries and see how it compares to the shockingly high rate in the US.
As Lieutenant Colonel Gary said they wake up, go to work, come home and eat as a family, etc.
Although it was during a different discussion, I also felt extremely impacted by the conversation we had with Bassim.
Whether people are liking each other's tweets because they agree with their classmate or just posting some constructive criticism of an opinion, the engagement in our lectures is off the charts.
I know sometimes, I tend to forget that the news can sometimes be biased, and that there are other things going on in a country other than what we are exposed to.
These people were my neighbors, classmates, teammates, and mostly importantly my friends, and I think it's so important for everyone to realize that the people committing these heinous terrorist attacks aren't Muslims,they are terrorists.
You never really think about soldiers having to interact with other people who are not the opposing soldiers, and I think that this emphasizes the fact that being in the army is not only about the violence.
In my opinion, I do not think they would receive the same amount of support.
I know that in my family, my parents go to work every day, but their jobs are not life and death related.
Rather, we are supposed to read about Jesus teachings and loosely model our lives according to his compassion.
I knew before that class that everyone, no matter where they are located, no matter what they are going through, is a human being.
Another thought I had when reading your post is that race isn't talked about enough, but racism is.
There is no true fact that says straight up that he meant to say this or that it is all based on interpretation.
As college students, we are supposed to be the educated youth.
What stuck out to me the most when sitting in on this class, was when the Colonel talked about how welcoming the civilians of Afghan were to him.
I would like to experience and learn about the many different parts of the world that I have yet to visit.
It honestly comes down to how someone interprets their religion.
However, this is what makes humans so unique because of the great diversity that we have.
It is truly terrifying to think about what it would take or how quickly it could happen that a radical group of Christians in the US could turn into basically a terrorist organization and start killing people in order to get their way.
I really agree with what you were saying in this response.
We should put more effort into discovering the whole truth and not just the snippets that we hear on the news.
I feel like currently it has been a bigger issue.
Hate groups do not and will (most likely) never have as much authority in America as they do in the Middle East, but if they did, we could find ourselves in a very similar quality of life.
We learned that both civilians and military personnel and police are being continuously killed and hurt in the war, and all of these people have one thing in common; they are all real people.
Out of the entire class, only one person raised their hand saying they would make it into heaven.
Isn't it amazing how LTC Garey explains how he tried to communicate with the Afghan people.
I hope that one day I can meet the people who we call our enemies so I can build relationships with them and realize for myself that the world is filled with people who are all just trying to make it by with their family and their pride and to minimize war and external problems.
In conclusion, I certainly believe that most civilians have no idea what really goes on at war.
Or I usually get questions like how did you cross the border?
It is this kind of videos I would love to show to people that have countless times criticized other religions without knowing what their own religion is doing as well.
It was a tragic incident that did not need to happen.
I could not imagine living in an environment like this and trying to live a happy life while being constantly surrounded and involved with war or violence.
Because in the Catholic faith, a reason for marriage is the promise to God to reproduce his children.
I could not agree more with you.
The Religious Freedom bills passed in some of the states show how we are regressing .
I also think that Sam brought up some very eye-opening points in this discussion.
If a girl is infertile is it okay to divorce her?
This is not how I feel life should be, whether I truly believe something is out there watching me and possibly guiding me.
I think this fact in and of itself is part of the reason why we have misconceptions and dont realize that this could occur anywhere.
In the United States, the divorce rate is increasing rapidly; people are getting married and remarried two, three, and four times in a lifetime!
In comparison, Islamic extremists have been responsible for 63 terrorist incidents in the U.S. between those dates.
Being a Christian myself, this thought has never really occurred to me or seemed like a big deal, but looking back at our countrys history and realizing that every single president we have had thus far has been Christian made me think about the subtle, subliminal oppression that other people experience on a daily basis.
People think they are dangerous which always leads them with terrorist.
I knew that a part of me knew it was wrong, but sometimes these things so just so ingrained into our minds and our normality that we stop seeing what is truly right and wrong.
Rafi closed by saying Do something good to stop the war, and this really stood out to me because he is asking for our help.
We are at an age where we all want instant gratification when were online and it rubs off on is in the real world.
This is a good example of how the civilians of the country we are at war are not always against us.
As a society, America has certainly progressed ;however, in the past few years it feels like we are going back to our old ways especially with the Trump administration in charge.
Compared to other countries we do discuss it a lot more but defiantly not as much as it should be.
I chose this video because I believe it is an important subject matter that is often overlooked.
I also cant even imagine being in his shoes mostly because Rafis partner was murdered doing that same type of work.
I feel our country does not address the topic of race enough.
Many people, from both cultures, do their best to lead their lives in accordance to the holy book that they follow, be it the Bible or the Quran.
Yes, all of Sams lectures are important, but this one was definitely a bit more real.
Thus, it is unjust to criticize a whole religion based upon actions that an ordinary Muslim would never commit.
I also agree that Rafi has incredible bravery to do what he does.
For this weeks video response assignment, I chose the What Quran Are You Reading video.
The fact that his partner was murdered just because he was trying to serve justice is very sad.
All I know is that I will never be able to fully understand how they feel, but like you said we can at least keep learning about it.
I agree with you that war is a sensitive topic.
The main point to all of this is that humans are, for the most part, born good and learn evil.
Now, even worse, imagine being a parent trying to raise and support a family in this type of environment.
There are so many hate groups around the world that have resulted from wrong interpretations of these books.
Personally I did not fully think about how many people are truly affected by war in their everyday lives simply because of the fact that the war in Afghanistan is hundreds of miles away from my own home.
The fact that he gets death threats and living in Afghanistan, which has been at war for so many years is astounding.
For instance, a black person according to the constitution is  of a person.
Then why arent they given that chance at happiness.
And some of the letters in the new testament were included much afterwards.
But I think it is important to find something that makes you believe in what you are doing and gives you purpose.
I found it interesting how he was able to explain to us that he felt a littleuncomfortable atfirst when the older man came up to him and invited him into his home for tea.
I've also noticed they've become more relaxed towards the norms of today, but some things they just will not budge on, like gay rights.
This leads to people receiving very extreme views day in and day out.
I found this interesting because Christians and Muslims have held many religious wars in the past, yet share the same holy people.
Men should be able to get a divorce if thats what he wants as long as he cares for the family.
According to LTC Garey, it was times of fear or excitement together where those bonds were formed.
These past few classes have really inspired me to become more aware of exactly what is going on with the war.
Interpreting the Bible differently with Christians is the same concept of Muslims interpreting the Quran differently, creating radical Muslims.
All the photos and videos I have seen depicted the violence and destruction that has taken place over there.
Although, Sam has done a great job breaking that barrier and allowing us to see into their lifestyles.
I also think that it mainly has to do with generations.
This is where some individuals that are radical shine best when they start following the religion no matter therepercussions.
I think one of the main reasons for this is because people are unwilling to explore other religions and become educated with how different religions work.
Because of the way the media portrays countries like this, I feel like a lot of Americans are like me in this situation, where they have a preconceived notion of what these countries are like and without this class, I would've stayed uniformed.
I now know that they are people just like us despite the fact that they live in a country full of war.
Sam compared humans to being like fish in the sea.
It would be a huge victory to get everyone to care, let alone to do something about it.
I thought it was very interesting that Sam used the example of Donald Trump as a man who has abandoned Christian principles but who gets support from Christians because he promises them a version of Christian Sharia.
For example, if the soldiers were well versed with Afghanistans hospitality then then they would have received the necessary information about the Taliban sooner or would have understood why such information was withheld.
Dr. Richards friend explains that the war within Afghanistan is a proxy war.
It was crazy to hear about the number of afghan civilians that were killed, and how easily it could be us and our families that are dealing with such loss.
I agree with you Isabella, the world moving in the direction of mixed races is a great thing humanity.
For example, Rafis partner was killed from an airstrike planned the United States and he was someone who had similar beliefs as us.
I wish more people would look at religion the way Sam has showed us.
This clip was eye opening to see that Christians have a lot of hate too, and it just goes under the radar kind of because no one realizes that they are all Christians.
They are the same people you see around you every day, only that they live their lives in a different way.
It was not until he experienced he realized that these humans are generous & they don't always carry a gun or knife with them because that's how people make it seem.
This helps them to be able to kill people and not feel as intense emotions while fighting.
I, along with a majority of the United States, should definitely want to learn more about our various countries throughout the world.
Now, in a way, many of us did not know what it was.
I also found it very interesting that he was present at a lot of the town meetings they had and really got a good idea of what their culture is like.
Something that really stood out to me was that a student in our class had his house bombed in Syria.
The Middle East is not plagued by countries that don't want to rule themselves.
Colonial Rich right off the bat goes into the common notion that most civilians have about soldiers.
I realized that Afghanistan is a country that has endured a lot, but even with that, they live the same daily lives that we do and do the same day-to-day things as well.
There are people all around us that are affected by war.
Religious extremists have their right to believe in the books how they choose to, but when it starts to interfere with the rest of the world, then there is a problem.
Sam distinctively points out that the Bible and the Quran are more of the same as they contain similar moral principles on how to live one's life.
People argue over what the Bible means all the time, and can each interpret it in a different way.
Fortunately, we were given the opportunity to hear from Rafi, a civilian currently living in the conflict zone of Afghanistan.
When I heard of Afghanistan, I immediately thought of a war zone due to what has occurred lately.
I agree how war really dehumanizes people.
This will make it easier for the soldiers to communicate with people who speak languages very different from English, Spanish and French.
It was truly eye opening because I often forget that part of those countries.
It is our country who puts war on so many others, and then makes it seem as if they are the bad guys.
The people of Afghan are not coldpeople who have known war all of their lives.
It was hard for me as well to view these people as normal citizens like us, but I also agree that we have been so used to it growing up whether it be from our parents, the news, or the media.
It is coming from outside of the borders and Afghanistan is more frustrated by this being ignored than any other problem thats being faced.
The media tries to make us feel better by showing us the struggles going on in other parts of the world outside of America.
People over there do have real families and lives and their reality is living in a war zone.
I agree with you in saying that this video was very eye opening for me.
When Rafi came to speak in class, it was a good learning experience for me.
As you said they shop at mall like us have jobs like us and much more very similar things so we need to stop picturing them as bad people when their really not.
Listening to Raffi speak about his people gave me a completely new (and educated) opinion of them.
The fact that the Israelis were so calm already eased the mood in our group.
I am open to relationships with people not of my race and I think more people should be as well.
Eventually it is just so normal that I stopped questioning whether or not I was being a bad person by making this stereotype.
We have access to so many other resources and there are endless possibilities, however at the same time these young men were similar to us in many ways as well.
He has chosen not to be angry, something I dont think I could do, and move past the even, just being happy that he is still alive.
Just like Mr. Rafi said it is important for us to do something about it at least just talk about it.
When he showed the map of the active hate groups in the United States, I was surprised to see the high amount of groups and that they were majority Christian.
We need to understand that Afghan people are just like us.
This tendency makes it common for people to care for a split second about the lives of people from foreign countries, and then go on with their lives.
Most of our view on war is what we see on TV.
He suggests that the leaders of the countries should be talking it out as opposed to the fighting.
The problem is, there are a lot of people.
I understand that bad things are happening, but that is only half of the story!
When we think of war, we tend to discuss the nation or nations we are fighting as one place, not the cities, towns, and families who make it up.
In conclusion, civilians definently DO NOT know what it is like to be a soldier at war.
My uncle was in the Army and growing up he would tell me about his personal experiences while in Afghanistan.
I also thought it was very interesting that Maziar said that everyone, when he traveled to Iran, was extremely welcoming and taught him many things about their culture and what they believe.
I move through life with a phrase that is goodness of the heart.
We have this notion that everyone in the middle east is a terrorist and that we should just bomb them all.
I agree that a lot of people's minds automatically jump to negative thoughts.
So we should stop judging them as bad people because that is far from what they are.
They are more similar than I originally thought, so why would put one down over the other.
Just let people live their own lives.
Right-wing extremists committed almost twice as many acts of domestic terrorism than Islamic extremists, but the public perception is that Islamic extremism is a bigger threat.
We couldnt possibly know what these people have really been through unless we talk to them for ourselves.
It is one thing to talk about what happens in Afghanistan and other places around the world, but to actually put a face to a name and feel like you personally know someone from these countries is a different story.
America is a very diverse nation, and yet the presidents have all had the same religion.
Sam stated that war isnt just out there, theres normal people with hopes and dreams just like us.
As Sam said, it's how each person interprets the book.
Another thing that I kind of assumed was that our beliefs would be extremely different.
Change is only possible with the proper education, and the getting the proper education begins with us.
And there were Greek manuscripts that contained different verses.
I really liked what you said in this post because I feel the same way as you.
Because not many people look at it that way, but when you do, you can see they are actually very similar when read literally.
I really enjoyed learning about the people of Afghanistan.
If images of children being injured and civilians houses being bombed were shown on news networks, the American reaction to the war would be drastically different.
He said that even if we cant do anything to directly stop the war, just spread the word that war is bad.
As you said, this could be our friends and family and I cannot even imagine the thought of that.
This lecture also gave me a clearer picture of what Afghanistan is like.
The way I talk, the way I act, the lifestyles I have is all influenced by my cultures.
How can we follow this kind of lifestyle when many Americans are fearful of this lifestyle in other cultures.
Their culture has been forgotten and looked down on.
We need to give them a chance to introduce themselves as a person instead of putting a label at them base on where they are from.
Its not okay to say that theyve been at war for years so theyre used to it.
I think a big part of this is how the media portrays Middle Eastern culture as well which makes people fearful of it.
We have been fighting in a foreign land for so many years, yet during this lecture was the first time that someone has mentioned to me that everyday people just like me have been personally affected.
We are only shown so much of what is actually going on so I think that when we hear about the number of deaths happening because of war, we never know how many people and families are actually being affected.
I strongly believe that opposites attract and that is why I myself, am more attracted to the members of different races.
That mall is no different than the one I go to, if anything it may actually be nicer.
I think it is such an important aspect that the military learns about the cultures of the places they are going to, for this really helps them while they are deployed.
I like that this class reminded us of families - mothers, fathers, sons and daughters, all of who are innocent and scared.
I think the media also plays a he part in it.
This helped me relate to the people and sympathize with them.
And yet, he still chooses to slowly forgive.
If the state were to give one religion power over any aspect of government, that action would inherently threaten the freedom of all other religions.
It seems to me that Americans could find more similarities than differences if you take the time to learn about the Afghan culture.
We can try our best to understand what war is really about but unless you have experienced war or know someone who has youll never get it.
Having a direct dialogue with Rafi allowed me to experience as firsthand as possible the current brutality of his world.
I questioned how everyone was so calm but then about two weeks and a half into our trip fighting broke out between Israel and enemy groups in the Gaza Strip and Near Golan Heights.
We should start to view it in terms of towns, malls, schools, parks, homes and families, so we can connect and see people living in war torn nations as people like ourselves.
Hate is not written into the bible for a good reason.
This is very different than how divorce works in the United States.
When the Arab spring first began it began in my parent's country, Tunisia.
How do American muslims feel about the medias portrayal of sharia law?
And this comes back to the good side needing a bad side to root out.
When both these men spoke it made me feel so naive for thinking that two people could be so different without even hearing any of them speak.
The last part of class that meant a lot to me was when Sam introduced us to his partner and friend Rafi.
We are lucky enough to have the choice to not live in fear like the Afghani people do.
He made me want to get to know the Afghan culture more.
This week I chose to reflect on the lecture that focused on how war affects real people.
However, according to Professor Richards, the Bible and the Quran are actually much more similar than I thought.
We need to put ourselves in their shoes and truly understand their struggle.
I think it gives a really good representation of who the Afghan people really are at heart.
Once the person gets comfortable, their way becomes the correct way.
However, I was not raised this way therefore, it is hard for me to understand their perspective.
I think with that statement, the sentiment that a number of Americans share of the Islamic Sharia law that it is too traditional can be easily backfired onto them as the American code of law is also based on the Bible.
Americans never stop to think about what Afghanistan is really like.
To me, religion is confusing and I think that no one person will interpret the bible, Quran, Torah, etc.
Itd be interesting to explore whether this is a good or bad thing.
This is something that actually happens in Afghanistan and the people who live their have to deal with this everyday.
In my opinion, not any holy scripture should be used to help determine things because not all have the same beliefs anymore.
Rafi, one of Sams good friends, lives his life in Afghanistan, constantly dealing with the threat of war that surrounds him and his family.
I feel we in the United States dont realize what its like to live under war circumstances.
That is why conversations and open-mindedness are so important and necessary.
Growing up, we are all sheltered and begin to harbor our on ideas of what the rest of the world is like.
People living in war zones are real and deserve proper recognition from the public.
Your response captures exactly how I feel about the talk on the Afghanistan people.
He said that he never knows if there will be an explosion any random day that could kill him.
Which begs the question, would there have been different outcomes of the war had people had a clear understanding of what Afghanistan really is.
I don't think its worth being mad about and that's because its deeper than just believing anything you're told.
I also agree that the media has made blinded people into the notion that the Quran is a book that poisons the minds of people.
We need to stop viewing these countries as places that we are fighting and really see how similar we really are to them, except they are innocent people living in much more dangerous environments.
Additionally, I feel that your closing remarks on how he must continue fighting because he has already been working toward peace for so long to be very accurate.
This topic caught my attention because before this class, I had never heard about this dialogue cross culture training that our guest promoted.
I feel that even Christians do this because they follow the bible and this incorporates into their daily lives.
He also mentioned that there isn't really a way to be sure of the exact meaning of everything in the Bible because everyone has different interpretations of it which makes it so difficult.
Ironically, we tend to cast them aside and strip them of their Christian label because we recognize their insane extremism.
As we see in Richards story however is that they are normal people too, they dont look any different or act any different than everyone else.
I have a significant interest in how this war is affecting civilians and how young people can contribute towards putting it to an end.
People believe that soldiers are always endangered and fighting.
I would say that the Bible was written to be interpreted in one way and have one meaning only.
The American soldiers shot and killed the children.
Sam has touched on this topic a lot this semester and I think it is a very important thing for people to realize.
Maybe because I am from a very catholic family and went to catholic school my whole life so I do have many different lessons from the Bible drilled into my head.
When Sam showed us the map of Afghanistan broken down and it was crazy to think about the number of innocent civilians that try to live a normal life like we all do.
For many people it is religion, for others it is family.
There are families there that go about their everyday life, kids that go to school, men that have jobs and just people that live the way you do.
Also, due to the fact that it is so far away we do not think there are real people just like us.
I love learning about different cultures and beliefs people have.
We need to learn about their life and how it has been ruined due to war.
This strategy is a lot more difficult to execute, however, it is a much more peaceful route and civilian deaths will decrease tremendously.
We have so much hate in this world and I believe understanding others better and their cultures can lead to a better understanding of that individual.
I agree with you that our generation is more accepting of peoples differences weather it be religion or sexual orientation.
The Colonels experience helped me to be able to open my eyes to accepting and understanding other peoples background and culture.
Take CNN and FOX news for example, they portray the extreme sides of the news.
It is much easier to get on board with the idea of war in a far away country by thinking they need our help.
I am a bit embarrassed to say that I have never been on a plane before.
I am glad that we talked about this topic in class because I honestly never realized the many similarities.
The media in our country definitely doesn't help either.
As a citizen of the United States, we cannot establish a national religion or, in a public setting, promote or teach one religion as being better than others.
With this being said, I never really thought about how people within the same religion can have vastly different opinions.
They lived in a time where racism was ok and not viewed as bad because everyone else in their area or family were thinking the same as them.
Becuase while we are all just people living our lives, there are significant differeneces between our countries which makes it harded to realize that we are all very similar at our cores.
This is what everyone does, and we never care enough to google some pictures of the capital or their mall or read an Afghani journal.
They are innocent people who need our help.
Why can people who are 21 drink?
He says that both of these are two different worlds where real people live.
This is why when something else is being introduced, not much attention is given to it because the person already has a way of doing the same task.
The way that he spoke so strong and clearly, never showing a sign of weakness, it was just truly inspiring, meanwhile the amount of dry eyes in the room kept dropping by the minute.
He also introduced us to his friend Rafi and told us his story of how the war has affected his life.
To see his spirit so high gives me hope as it is something to believe in.
And some scholars think there are as many as five different voices in the Pentateuch.
Although they see it as a guide to their life, it is open to interpretation by everyone.
The guest speaker said that people there are welcoming, they are open-minded to everyone even to invite people on the street to home to have a cup of tea.
I couldnt imagine what it would be like to have your life turned upside down by war.
It would be more honest and try to reflect information that people want and need rather than follow their agendas.
Having the unique opportunity of hearing Rafi speak really put it into perspective that these things happen to real people, just like us.
I have kind of experienced this because there is a lot of stereotypes about the Mexican culture.
Like you said, tolerance is key.
Another thing that Rafi said that I really liked was that peace always wins.
LTC Garey was quick to tell us all that in most cases of war, this isnt true.
Thank you for sharing.
that's that, and its it'll probably never change.
The civilians that the man encountered were not brainwashed by the extremist groups and just normal people who have families and feelings.
They have lived under war circumstances for a long time now.
Its hard to say how any one person would react to living life like that.
They are constantly doing different things to benefit their counrty and direct combat is not always the answer.
I realized that I have never taken the time to think about the ways war affects not only our own nation but also the people of other nations involved.
A lot of Christians interpret the bible in whatever way they feel like doing so, there is no section or verse that directly states their actions.
This isnt World War I anymore where theyre in trenches and shooting at each other all day.
The soldiers assumed the kids were putting toxic gases around them to kill them.
There are so many offensive words that are said in our society.
Just because people share the same religion, does not mean they share the same beliefs.
We have always been told that we have the richest, best country, and we are easily convinced when it is our own country being discussed.
I had a friend at the same time who was about to go to Afghanistan and I was terrified.
Does anyone know what the bible is actually saying?
Media organizations show the extremes and therefore make everything seem way worse than it really is.
The first thought that comes to me when I think of those countries is unsafe and like you said not a good economic situation.
Afghanistan is a country that has known war for almost thirty years but what do we really know about the war and how its affecting the civilians of Afghanistan.
Every person is the same underneath skin color and facial features, so why treat people differently based on what they look like.
I think first and foremost it was a very interesting way Sam had built up to it, when he first told of the story of his friend and providing us with the graphic photos of tragedy that helped paint the picture for us.
But, if someone were to talk about a mall in America, London, Paris or Canada, not for a second would I doubt it to be true.
I grew up with two Republican parents who supported the Bush administration.
I probably like most people who never realized that it was more than just killing the antagonistic country.
In this way advertising corrupts influence and how cultures and certain values are view, where the view of the negativity overrides what these people actually practice and work on daily.
What shocked me even more the that though was that I wouldnt have been able to tell you what quarter was which if I didnt have a tour guide.
I picked this video because I think it is an important subject.
It made me upset to hear that a man who is only trying to push for change and fight for a better life for his family can be threatened on the regular.
Something that really struck me when he was telling us stories about his experiences was when he had tea with the village elder.
He also mentioned how he missed their culture and I can understand that when they were so welcoming.
The majority of people in Afghanistan do not want blood and war.
So enlightening that a man who has lost so much and undergone so much tragedy can be so strong and think so clearly in a situation it is easy not to.
No religion supports divorce and it actually is a sin but one cannot stay in an abusive relationship.
But after hearing Rafi talk, and seeing how much hope he has, it gives me hope that one day the conflict in Afghanistan will get better.
It's true what Dr. Sam Richard mentions about the war being out there how it is real.
I too never really thought about the similarities between Christians and Muslims until Sam explained it to us in class.
It of course helps to justify your cause when your beliefs are the only ones left standing.
I found it interesting that he said he spent a majority of his time with civilians, this way they were able to learn more about them, how ISIS was recruiting, where people went, and just more about their behaviors and patterns as a society.
I am white, and although in some situations I might be in the majority race, I do not see that as grounds to put other people down.
They listen to whose willing to preach about the book, when maybe they should read it for themselves to decipher the different meanings.
Those people killed are just like any of uschildren, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers.
It is a very disturbing thing knowing that there are people who have this much hatred.
I think it is so terrible that real people, just like you and me, have to deal with war in their everyday lives because of disputes between governments.
In my past discussion group we talked about whether backlash is a positive or negative thing, and I believe that in our class it is usually always positive.
I personally always have considered myself a good person.
Most of those wars were prompted by Christianity.
These three religions have been in conflict since the scriptures were written so its crazy to me why people are still in conflict today when we have the internet at hand to educate us on our differences.
I feel that these similarities really hit home for most of the class.
We owe it to those people that have been affected by this war to help bring peace back to that region and drive ISIS out.
This was eye opening as well as amusing because if it came down to what the bible actually states, very few of us would go to heaven.
I honestly have yet to have to opportunity to be able to travel around the world.
I feel like both religions were made to guide and give people faith.
I feel like Sam presented this point very well and the way he connected his points and the logic he implemented made it very difficult for most people to argue with.
If the bible can be interpreted differently for many different people then people of other religions should be given the same fair point of view.
My little cousin lost a lot of her hair from hearing gunshots right outside her window.
I also agree with you saying that people are too afraid to learn things about other people or other countries.
I particularly loved the part of the class when he mentioned that peace always comes on top, and historically he is right.
Normally you would think that everyone would freak out if people were trying to invade and bomb their country but no, everyone just kept on with their normal lives.
The concept honestly does not make sense to me.
When we begin to feel a sense of interdependence as a human society, we will truly learn compassion.
War really does dehumanize people, we think of them as the enemy, often grouping innocent civilians in with that title, without realizing what we are doing.
I wish I knew they were so thoughtful, hospitable and generous because maybe it would have shaped my opinion of the war differently.
Essentially, it would be setting the ground works for how we marry, how we divorce, how we should eat food, how we should worship, etc.
That really stuck out to me because I know I have always made generalizations about the people of Afghanistan that were not true.
Their job essentially is to study these people and to gain knowledge on their society.
I have never been pro war, but I also have never taken a step back to reflect how the war is affecting the Afghani people.
That is no way a family should have to live their lives.
Individuality is important and diversity is key to success in our culture.
You don't know what buildings that are going to be hit and take the lives of those people that are in those buildings.
Just because some people did some bad things does not mean that all Islam people are terrorists or bad people.
It's amazing to hear how they live in fear but yet are so welcoming to an American.
I believe this alone shows that soldiers have emotion because if they did not, they would not suffer from PTSD and would act as if the war was just another day.
This clouds our desire to understand the individual rather than the entire group.
The fact that there are many out there like him who have similar stories is heartbreaking.
They still arent even considered whole, how is that fair?
I have always had respect for the army but it is hard to understand what they do on a day to day basis.
I feel so uneducated about it which is really frustrating because hearing Rafi first hand made it really hit that this is not something small.
Ive heard of people going to Afghanistan for vacation and I always thought they were crazy and stupid but these people would come back and have such a positive view of Afghanistan.
That takes true courage to go against the grain and do what you feel is right, no matter the consequences that may or may not come from your actions.
I think it is necessary for us to realize all this as it is in our hands to ensure the happiness of such people.
When thinking about basing a society on religion, one must be careful since there are thousands of ways how people may interpret them.
Without Raffi speaking to us, I would still have that incorrect view of the Afghan people.
In class, Sam probes us to imagine using the Bible as the only explanation for our laws and government and how we should live our lives.
I mean just look at Rafi, and there are plenty of others like him who are constantly putting their lives on the line with no gear to protect them, to help rebuild their country.
Although some of the experiences during deployment may not always be ones willing to be remembered, these experiences are things that unite individual soldiers as one.
If we start talking about that it may make a difference as more and more people get to know about it.
They truly are real people with real lives, with the caveat that they could be killed in war at any minute.
But I'm sure these are just small portions of crazy people (at least in my perspective), because I also know Nuns who believe in woman's rights, who have open hearts to everyone they meet despite their religion or color.
Rafi endures death threats everyday, just because he is trying to make Afghanistan a better place.
When in reality, if you are twisting the words of the bible into anything other that what is exactly written on that page, you are interpretting it and therefore opening a door to many various ideas about what it is actually saying.
Just because you don't know there are a lot of violent Christians bombing, killing, torturing and hating other people doesn't mean they're not out there doing so.
The mall in Kabul was bombed.
There was not a single article on how it was Americas mistake of bombing Basims house or his brothers house.
The bible has always fascinated me.
They also have to work to keep the society to run in the order.
Leaving home everyday fearing for your life is a horrible way to go through life and it makes me feel for the people of Afghanistan who just want peace.
The bible is a way to have a belief in something because it is holy or good.
If we as humans did not, the world would likely be a much more peaceful place.
I think this video definitely made us more aware that real people in Afghanistan are going through war.
I had a stereotype in my mind that was put there through media and other peoples opinion.
I was mostly surprised by how much it seemed like a western civilization.
Again and again, we seem to only hear about terrorist attacks and how we will get back at them with the use of military force.
I was born in the US and I have no understanding of what it would be like to grow up in a war zone, but it happens to real children.
It is never going to be justified and there are many sides to the argument.
I wonder if certain parts of Sharia law, like requiring a certain fulfillment of reasons by the woman if she is to file, may bring down the divorce rate in a good way?
Islam has taken a lot of bad media coverage in the last decade due the terror attacks and the war in Afghanistan.
Life is not supposed to be that way.
Along with this, Sam had presented several graphs that showed that the death tolls of Afghanistan citizensare continuously rising and that they are not expected to decrease anytime soon.
I never really knew about this clause before because religion is brought up in politics all the time.
Another thing you can add is how LTC Garey talks about the relationship between soldiers.
No matter how much they proclaim they might be, they are following the Quran.
I know people who were directly affected by 9/11 and my own mother used to work on the 102nd floor of one of the Twin Towers a few years before the attack.
How did we get this way?
If they consider themselves Christian, then are all Christians like them?
With all of the stuff we see in the media about Sharia law, this man is actually one of the people that is fighting it.
I see your point about not being directly affected by the war, so your views are a little different, however I have a dad and a brother who are in the military and I still feel somewhat detached.
Personally, I could never do what he does each and every day, have complete instilled confidence, and live each day not knowing the outcome of tomorrow.
In the end, they are also people as well and I feel very fortunate that I am not in such a scenario like that because I do not know how I would survive in that country and it is hard to imagine my life compared to what it is right now.
I remember talking to a couple of young men, who I believe were from Iran, last year in my World in Conversation experience.
In addition, I never knew that Afghanistan had town malls or cities just like ours in the United States.
He said that his parents are well off and he doesnt suffer from racial supremacy, so solving racism isnt a problem that he feels he needs to urgently fix.
All this must come out and be talked about.
Our guest clearly emphasized that the only way that we can stop war is dialogue and addressed an opportunity for students to take a step towards making the world a better place.
A holy book has teachings that only reach a certain point in which the follower of that religion has to apply what he or she believes is right (by applying what he or she has learned from the book).
So perhaps a better alternative would be integrating more learning about the world in the school system so that curiosity and understanding of different cultures would be embedded at a younger age.
But to figure out how to solve that issue of radicalism is pretty challenging.
I was very intrigued by the way Sam showed how subjective religious texts can be like the bible and the Quran.
The problem with radicalization (besides the obvious) are the blurred lines that come from the text they read.
The Christians Sam was talking about in class believe that the way they interpret the bible with such hate is the work of God.
Despite knowing the harsh reality of this, it is extremely admirable that Rafi still continues to do what he does.
Anytime I hear the media talking about the war on Afghanistan it's always about how can we stop ISIS and the only action we seem to use is military force.
According to me, culture is an important part of my life.
It helped me realize that we are not as different as I had thought originally.
Self-reflecting on what came to mind when I thought of Afghanistan all I could think about was the war too.
History shows that the mainstream media is quick to label an incident committed by a Muslim or any person of color as terrorism but is slow to do the same when the perpetrator is white.
The images of Afghanistan that I see are always of warn torn towns that are barely standing, and that was all I thought there was in that country.
It is so sad that they being affected by war.
Families just trying to make a living just like ours.
It is just our difference in generation that makes it harder for racism to not go away.
Theres a reason as to why radical Islam has the power that it does, and that is through force alone.
He tells us that the majority of his time overseas is spent engaging with civilians in Afghanistan and learning more about them.
War is very subjective in that innocent men, women, and children going about their business are completely affected by it every day.
We truly are privileged people and we never recognize it until it is taken away from us or when we see someone we know suffer in a way we havent.
After all, Afghanistan is his home and no matter where he goes, he will always miss his home country.
People often argue about the meanings of certain things but there is no way to be sure the exact purpose or meaning of something Jesus said.
Everyone agreed that we would have been completely devastated and angry about the bombing and would have done something about it.
At first, that sounded difficult to believe given what has transpired in the country.
Just like fish we are used to our environment and just swim through life uninfluenced.
Civilians arent the only ones dying, military personnel are there trying to help but some of them are killed too.
He has been through hell and back, but is still willing to come and talk to our Soc119 class every year.
I think you brought up a great point in your discussion for this video.
Without have any knowledge about who you are.
Since 2001 the numbers of innocent civilians killed have only significantly increased.
Later in the video, Sam began to introduce his friend, Rafi, and told the class about his background and family.
I think that this topic was something extremely important for Sam to talk to us about and I thought this video was interesting as well.
People on both sides of the war are being brainwashed each day.
When do we feel it is time to step in when issues arise?
I know personally that when I see something in the news, I almost never try to learn more about it from another source, and immediately start making generalizations about a certain country or population.
I had always just gone along with the general idea that homosexually was bad because the bible said so.
This inherit racism in the system makes the issue so much worse because blacks know that they have less opportunity so the incentive to work hard diminishes reducing the number of opportunities available to them.
This often leads to large misconceptions from people and creates incorrect assumptions.
Every time I hear some comment of this type I feel absolutely indignant.
First off, these books were written thousands of years ago, so they are very cut throat and literal.
In addition, I think a carefully written law that establishes the relationship between the countries should be agreed upon first.
It is astonishing that people that this are able to put their fears aside to stand for their country and fight for their people.
Life there is not easy, and for this stuff to end, discussion is the must.
We need to work through the hard stuff.
Overall, I personally have a much better understanding of how everyone's interpretation of the Bible, Quran, or any religious book can be very different based on what they are apart of and how they choose to interpret the information.
I could not imagine living in a place where I would see my friends and family getting killed.
Everyone is different and everything thinks and processes information in a different way.
Most of these people use small, specifically selected lines in the bible that lead them to believe white men are superior, homosexuality is evil, or that God wants soldiers dead.
The world would be a much better place if this religious ignorance was done away with.
He had terrible things happen to him, and you wouldnt even know it.
Like you said what is going on in Afghanistan could also be happening here.
It is interesting to hear from people who are not from around here.
This thought is extremely upsetting because many people believe that an Americans life is worth more than others, yet we are all humans and created equal (in my eyes).
Hearing that, at first, It was a little bit troubling and quite frankly, frightening.
When we talk about this war we talk about how brave our American soldiers are and we pray for them every day, but we are blind to a large group of people affected by this war.
I remember telling my mom that I was unsure if I believed in the afterlife and she immediately questioned if she raised me right.
Small villages that do not have running water, no internet, etc.
I literally know nothing about any of those nationalities - not because I don't have respect for them, but because I kind of just consider them all to be simply 'white'.
Take a look at the way Donald Trumps presidency has affected the military forces.
The part of class that really got to me was when Sam showed Rafis children on the screen.
This emphasizes the problems that races face in race relations and how impartial treatment has affected their lives.
Watching Rafi speak in the manner he did about the absolute atrocities that happened to his family truly is a humbling experience and gave me a whole new angle on the war.
I often forget I have different heritages and backgrounds that are interesting and valid just because of the fact that I'm not a visibly different race or color.
I learned in class after listening to Rafi that that is not completely true as there are so many peaceful and kind people who live in those countries.
My friend spent a lot of his time working out, and training Afghan military within the confines of the American military base.
I would find governing the united states based on the words of the bible not only extremely challenging due to interpretation, but undoubtedly unfair.
Afghan people, actually, have a more open culture than we do.
Never the less I knew friends that went on the trip before me so I was very excited to go.
For LTC Garey, this was probably an incredible surprise when his translator informed him that this Taliban member had been conversing casually with LTC Garey for what he says to have been hours.
But any movement without the ability to question can stem into a dangerous one, and whether their opinions line up with your own we should be careful trusting any lifestyle that is inherently true.
I think that if there were more conversations with people across the world that the views people have would be changed dramatically.
This was not what many of us were expecting to hear which is kind of sad.
But like Sam was saying that there is no clear answer written to these questions in the Bible.
Unfortunately, this idea could not be more wrong.
I really enjoyed listening to Raffi speak because it changed my view on how we see others.
I take full responsibility for being clueless and I am glad this class is teaching me to be more aware.
I applaud him for being able to forgive Americans, because I know that I personally could never do so.
I like how Rafee talks about what life is like for the civilians in Afghanistan.
It is all about how the person interprets the Bible and then applies it to his or her life.
And in the same sense it can also cause controversy through the Sharia, as in they could follow some things and not all.
After taking time to digest lecture, and gather my own thoughts, I feel that there should be minimum use of religion in our government.
Grant, you make some great points.
Seeing the photographs of him and his family really helped me connect to those in Afghanistan.
He talks about Rafi and his family how he has two daughters.
Colonel tell us about their experience helped us understand better what is going on.
I realized that once I step outside and stop listening to the media, things really aren't as bad as they seem and life is still going on the same it always has.
His goal is to make the subject of race and diversity more of a common thing that everyone is comfortable talking about no matter their background.
With this being said I have never had very concrete views about what I personally think about religion.
Iappreciated him sharing hisexperiencebecause I think that a lot of American'sdon't know about the Afghani culture and how things work there.
I think this may be because it is human nature to find it difficult to hold ones self accountable for his or her own actions and it is much easier to twist the words of the bible to justify ones actions.
So, I think a lot of problems come from not truly understanding the text and obviouslyhow people interpret the text.
Colonel Garey, who has done several tours in Afghanistan, spoke how his viewpoint on the war was totally changed after his first tour.
The way Sams compares countries and cultures really open up my mind to new ways of life and proves how we are all 99.5% the same.
There are way too many complexities in life to simply turn to one book written thousands of years ago to address.
All of this is no different from people living in America.
Rafi said that his friend was killed by the Taliban, because he was fighting for peace.
Not only have I never been taught about the country in school, I never bothered to educate myself.
Hell, ISIS is out here attacking us on our own land.
We don't need such an iron hand in the Middle East.
It should not be okay to judge a group of people based on the country that they live in.
I say this because if we are harming innocent people, that makes us no different than the people we are at war with.
It is a virtually impossible task to literally interpret the words of The Bible and apply them to the complexities of modern society.
We need more people like the colonel who is willing to learn and appreciate the culture of another place and not just assume that they are against us.
For me this made me realize how the war in Afghanistan isnt just people fighting in deserts alone.
Ive talked to people who are on board with things like the bathroom bills and there seems to be a strange disconnect.
This really shows the importance of understanding other religions, even if you actively follow one already.
We, as a people, need to find a way to better educate ourselves on the happenings of the world, so that we can make strides to better the world we live in.
Its hard to be able to state exactly what each verse in the bible means.
I have always associated the people with the war and have never really thought they were any different.
However, I realize that not every human or Catholic is perfect or moral and my viewpoint was definitely changed after this video.
The part of this lecture that opened my eyes to this point the most was when Sam showed us the images of a shop in a poorer town contrasted with that of the shopping mall in Kabul, a major Afghan city.
It shows that we are extremely lucky to live in a country where war is not occurring.
Its amazing that they are so open to welcoming people in their home while we are so closed off and view them as terrorists.
Being able to experience German culture was very eye-opening to me, and I would like to continue to gain new experiences in new places.
I was very intrigued by the fact that so many countries could go to war with each other and how so much life could be lost so quickly.
Being a psychology major I found this particularly interesting.
It is almost as if the country of America is toonave to understand that most of the things we hear about through media are extreme and amped up for the press and to attract attention.
So it was very intriguing to hear what Rafid had to say about divorce in his culture.
Talking to others is such an important role, yet everyone seems to stay quiet when it comes to these sensitive subjects.
It definitely made people think about and realize that they were also part of one (or more) of these groups.
For example, when the discussion of legalizing gay marriage was such a debate, I had trouble wrapping my head around the fact that certain people could not accept love for love because their religion believed otherwise.
I think we have the opportunity to change that for the next generation.
Dr. Sam mentions that Rafi has two daughters who are Afghans and that they are real people just like everybody else.
I also believe this is how innocent civilians are also killed, because sometimes they are thought of as hostile because of the way they carry out certain things, when in reality it is part of their daily lives but no one bothered to understand that.
If you want to buy a gift for one of your Chinese friends, make sure you never get a clock, because the phrase to give a clock in the Chinese language sounds similar to the phrase used to say goodbye to a dying person.
Some action has to be taken, small or big.
The thought is beyond terrifying, and yet our society still often chooses to ignore what is happening to these individuals.
I feel as if people get divorced too much in the united states, but I also think that in Sharia, more people may be unhappy with their significant other because the rules are very strict on the reasons as to why they can get divorced.
Common sense seems to be the key to living a good life, and many people feel they need a book to tell them if they are living right or not.
Average income for whites is expected to double in the next 30 years for white people while, black peoples average income is projected to increase about 10%.
This is unfortunately unavoidable as humans naturally crave a feeling of importance and a sense of purpose.
What is the point of trying to make the future better for our children when we know that we are going to die and our children are going to die and our children's children are going to die?
This was a major eye opener for me, seeing how these people are in the middle of a century long war and still want to be friendly to the US.
Eric, I agree with the things you have written.
It spoke out to me because my parents are Muslims and I was raised through the teachings of Islam (even though I eventually lost sight of religion).
It's amazing to me to see that America has even written laws based on the Bible, for instance divorce, which Sam talked about a lot, and how the Bible does not hold the answer to everything, only interpretation.
When discussing divorce in terms of U.S. laws and Muslim laws it was interesting how they were different in subtle ways, but in the end both sets of laws essentially did the same thing.
This class already is making me change how I think.
He then discussed how it is quite the opposite and how emotional it can be at times and the bonds you create with your peers due to the experiences you share.
I thought about all the Christians I knew and according to the Bible would not be going to heaven.
Its just so neat to learn about the different cultures and beliefs people have in other areas of the world.
Picking and choosing parts of the bible to support these beliefs is what gives them such influence.
The reason I have this prior notion isbecause I am uninformed about the culture in Afghanistan.
Its all such a blurry topic and it ultimately comes down to the person.
This is due to the fact that people have different opinions on what triggers the action of wanting to get a divorce.
The part where his wife says goodbye as if every day could be their last is just a truly saddening thing.
We naturally dehumanize the war when it comes to the other side.
I would say that the US is lucky that people here are actively involved in defending others from hate groups and the law empowers you to let you protest, in my opinion, simply because the church and the state are 2 separate entities here.
Of course this is totally hypothetical but I think it would be very interesting to see what the world would be like without religion, Im sure there would still be extremists in other regards but maybe not having an ideology that you believe so strongly would be a good thing.
The September 5th class was extremely informative and I believe we could only benefit from hearing and learning about each others cultures.
Thats who he sided with, because he was trying to keep himself and his family safe.
It is crazy to think that Rafi lives in a country where humans his family never feel safe because there could be a terrorist attack at any time.
I really liked the story about how the man would just invite new people in the village for tea.
However, I do believe that could happen in the not-so-distant future.
It was very interesting to see all the parallels we had with Afghani people from across the world.
And that scares people, and there is nothing wrong with that, humans are naturally scared of things they do not know much about.
War is a scary thing to experience and the fact that we have not seen a war since the civil war on American soil is astounding, especially for the fact that we are always participating in a war.
Having Rafi speak to the class help show that they are truly no different than we are.
It is incredible to see how fortunate Christians are in the idea that they are able to say or do things to a much larger extent that other religions would be looked down upon for in our society.
I ask, why do these innocent and nice people have to live in a constant fear of war and death when they have never hurt, fought, or killed anyone in their life?
After this lecture I continued to think about how some people and the news can skew people's opinions about certain religions and how unfair it is.
They might not have the best pronunciation but you can clearly see their effort in trying to learn my culture.
And complete books were taken off.
Their religion helped them get through the tragedies that they face every day.
I definitely do agree that we need to be teaching more about tolerance and acceptance of differences, but one thing that I always wondered is how helpful religion has actually been to humanity as a whole.
This is why it meant so much to me that Sam made people realize how important it is to be more conscious and aware that there is more than one way to look at things.
I also am dumfounded that Rafi has a family and still does all of this dangerous work.
All of the information from last weeks lectures were very interesting, but there was one topic that stood out to me.
I too cannot believe that those views are accepted by anyone.
I personally find it absolutely crazy how people would interpret that information so they can do harm to others.
The idea that we have to stay in war to keep more groups from rising up is a counter intuitive narrative that frankly has not proven true last year, nor the year before, nor the years prior.
I like that soldiers are not just fighting because that is what they are told to do but really thinking about the people's lives that they are effecting.
In the clip I watched, Rafi shares what war is like for the civilians of Afghanistan.
Your post was very well written and interesting to read, and I agreed with everything you had to say.
People have varying degrees of religiousness as well.
There is nothing wrong with that of course, it is a democracy after all.
This is an answer that would apply to any certain group of people having a special bond.
It can even lead to a change in your life as understanding more and growing your wisdom about what individuals do because of their culture can make a huge difference in the way you see the world.
This graph illustrates the inequality in the U.S. and Afghan military personnel being killed in the war.
Having my dads side of my family live in Germany really helped me to acknowledge the prosperity of somewhere other than America.
Montreal was a new trip for me this past summer and going into it I had this schema made up based solely on what I had heard or seen in a picture or two.
Do we use the bible as a coping mechanism, because if I believe the bible is telling me xyz then that means I AM RIGHT and it is OKAY to do xyz.
LTC Garey shared that before he travelled to Afghanistan, people warned him to be wary, as the culture is completely immersed in war and the people are dangerous.
For example, if people think they know what is going on in Iraq, no one feels like they need to do their own research because they think they already know the whole truth.
Does this help to support Americas foreign policies in the Middle East?
It struck me at that moment, Rafis family deserves to live in happiness and safety and that his wife doesnt have to worry about whether he will be coming back home that night or not.
For that reason, I feel our presence is still necessary.
This picking and choosing of what we actually take into consideration is really a selfish act.
Just like most soldiers, my uncle suffered from PTSD when he returned home.
I always try to do what I think is right.
He goes on to explain that in that situation 100 years ago they came to a solution of having a sit-down negotiation and it helped the issues at hand.
The fact that Bassim and many others dont carry resentment in their heart for the US because he as he said they understand why what happens, happens is amazing to me, because I couldnt say the same for myself if I was in his position.
Nearly every religion has been used as a platform for legitimizing and distributing hate against other groups, some have even been created solely for that purpose, such as the Norse-influenced cult the Nazis created for themselves.
Radical Christianity exists, and it is becoming more evoked since the presidency of Trump.
I know when I think about people in ISIS and the Taliban I think of people who are ruthless and would never be taken alive, and this story showed me that my whole perception on what was going on over in Afghanistan was completely false.
Regarding Christian Sharia in America, I do not think it is fair that homosexuality tends to be put down far more than the other groups on the list.
I know that sounds horrible but its just what I thought.
On the news, we will see terror in the world by these groups and everyone will point fingers at everyone who shares the same religion even if they have a different interpretation of the books.
Thanks to Rafi, he is trying to make a difference and fight for his people which is something people in America need to try harder at.
I have learned a lot about the Afghan people these past couple of weeks.
After being in this class, I often wonder the same thing.
Parents who have students at that school who are muslim are outraged.
All religion is peaceful till its not, and all religion can be violent till its not.
I found it very eye-opening when Rich described having to understand more about the enemy.
Therefore, I believe the US military should begin to move in more diplomatic ways.
Does not mean that all Afghan people hold these beliefs.
Just because some people take a book and interpret it in a radical way.
We think as lawyers as great people just trying to do some good but in Afghanistan you may not want to be around them for you might put your life in danger.
Basically, if a woman wants a divorce for the right reasons, she can get one, but if men want a divorce, it is up to the wife and they will need to take care of the family for an extended period of time.
To know that the Afghan civilians were so kind and had such a welcoming and unique culture would have made Americans think harder about their opinion on the war and those it affected.
My parents always did their best to teach me not to judge.
They are not taught to hate Americans, and treat them just as they would anyone else.
It is rare to ever hear about a terrorist attack that was started by Christians, meanwhile tragic events like this happen more often than not.
the Bible is similar to the Quran in the way that they are both based on an individual's interpretation.
Essentially, the Bible cannot explicitly explaining everything so we must use our great gift of intellect to solve certain issues.
The most important aspect is equality showing in this religion women are treated as a possession and men are praised upon.
It all basically comes down to the way that people interpret their religious books.
It has happened before, so what do we have today that is preventing it from happening again?
Yeah I agree we can't just pull out, but we also can't keep exerting this force to keep the countries destabilized in fear that providing resources would better ISIS and the Taliban.
It seems like religion is only separated from politics when its not Christianity that is involved.
I liked how Sam started off with a quote from the Bible saying that only homosexuals will not make it into the heaven, and then completed the quote with the full list of people who also will not: fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, sodomites, thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers, and extortions.
I am from Philadelphia and the farthest I have been from there is Indianapolis for the Big 10 Championship game last football season.
I couldn't even imagine living in that kind of of situation let alone think about the thoughts that run through Afghans' minds.
I had not really thought about that fact before this class, and now thinking about it, I'm not really sure how prominent everything in the media talks about really is.
These two extremes come from how people interpret the Bible.
I think that the amount of deaths that take place because of war are just completely awful.
Before, during, and after these horrific events, the inhabitants of countries across the sea are facing issues that have never even really crossed my mind when living in America.
Seeing the perspective of how these topics are closely tied into religion explains why people feel compelled to defend their beliefs.
Even if both follow the same religion because whoever has to solve these problems could have different translations of what certain things mean.
I just never really felt affected by this issue, even though I had always recognized it.
I do not worry about more interracial couples at all.
Kelly, I found the Radicalizing the Bible video to be very interesting as well.
In my opinion organized religion, as a whole, has that problem.
Rafi is the father of two daughters and is actively involved in social work, including the type that work hard to protect females and secure their safety.
Dr. Richards friend continues to elaborate saying that there is a different level of trust between what happened in Oman and what is happening today.
I thought it was really important for Sam to have Rafi speak because it really puts things into perspective.
For example, in the past, Christians and Muslims have held many Crusades and Jihads against each other.
I also found it interesting and a bit shocking to hear that most of Rich's time in Afghanistan consisted of more time talking and engaging with civilians rather than fighting.
However, in class we learned that this is not the case.
I responded to the same video that you did, and I said some similar things in my response.
Two Christians could have totally different views on things like divorce and marriage and death because of what they truly think is right or wrong.
It is so hard to put myself in the shoes of the Afghan people like Rafi who live everyday in danger of losing their life.
Being in the 21st century I would say these laws are way passed its time and we as a whole should evolve with the world around us.
During class I learned that the Bible, the Quran, and the Torah are all open for interpretation.
It is apparent that everyone's first thoughts were those such as it being a war zone.
Everything in life is always relative and clearly everyone has their problems, some more major than others, seeing the way Basim has dealt with his struggles inspires me.
I consider myself Christian but wouldn't look in the Bible to learn how to live my every day life by following every rule that is written in the Bible and I think many people would agree with that.
In the video that I chose, a special guest discusses how dialogue helps with bringing peace in relation to the current war.
I feel that many Americans have a negative stereotype against people from the Middle East.
So to see him tell a classroom of 700 American students he does not blame us was extremely inspiration and makes me want to strive to be a more forgiving person.
But for him to not have spite toward people of the United States is a tough thing for anyone to do.
He helped humanize the people of Afghanistan to prove to us that they are just like us.
I think you're right that people put it out of mind because its easier than putting that effort into having an open mind.
Do different sects of Islam believe in different versions of Sharia law?
So many Christians say that we should use the Bible as a basis upon which we should establish our society, as Sam mentioned.
I didnt know much about this culture, but the little things I knew were just negative.
I am a science major so I believe in evolution, but I've always had trouble understanding this whole concept of life.
When the colonel talked about their warm welcoming and invites to have tea, I think about the US.
When he showed the picture of Rafi I felt something I havent felt before.
Time and time again we see that nonviolent movements achieve their purpose.
Once Rafi fully told us, Okay, these are the valid reasons for a woman to file for divorce in Afghanistan, I realized that a lot of them were reasonable and that Afghan women were perhaps not as trapped in their marriages as I had initially thought based on my perception.
We also discussed how it was completely insulting how the United States barely gave him any money for restitution, I believe that it was only $15,000.
The statistics about all the lives taken during war, civilian and military, was eye opening.
The more we are aware of what is happening in the world, the more action we can take.
I feel that if we were shown more we would have much more empathy towards the situation then we currently do which is sad.
I thought it was a very interesting lecture, because I think that people often overlook how similar they truly are.
I agree with Samantha's idea that a small portion of a group doesn't represent the whole group.
I agree with you Gillian, I was too very intrigued and inspired by Rafis answer to this question.
The laws hold the men both morally and legally accountable, which is interesting.
Even though its our fault that the region was destabilized in the first place, we thought we were doing the right thing at the time and the power vacuum we created gave rise to even worse things like ISIS.
When Sam showed an example of Christian Sharia Law, I thought it was totally radical.
This made me realize that we are only being given half of the story.
They have the same moral views, stories, and life teachings in order to help us understand how to live in our own world.
The way Basim had the ability to forgive and go on living a positive life is truly motivating.
He talked about, What is Sharia, which I have never really known what it was until he explained it.
It's scary to think that if my parents are stuck in their ways, extremists will always be too.
Sam did a great job bringing in Rafi, because a lot of people won't believe whats actually going on until they actually hear it from someone who lives it everyday.
I have been raised in a Christian home and do consider myself a Christian.
It is not as long as the Bible, but is more complex then we even know.
When a person is taught a certain specific thing, that is the way they will be most comfortable doing what they learned.
I also found it very eye-opening when Sam compared Americans' fear of sharia law when in fact many Americans push Christian Sharia Law.
He interprets the Quran and makes it into laws that can help people in Afghanistan.
Some of these people are starting war while others are just trying to survive.
I also agree with what you are saying.
Originally, I also believed that Sharia Law consisted of people killing others who are not islamic, killing homosexuals, and oppressing women.
Its a very interesting law since, as Sam said, we break it all the time.
But as you mentioned, if we just didn't relate Afghanistan as a synonym for war we can maybe see the big picture and realize that they have good, hard working people who are just trying to live their normal lives.
The video is a students question comparing what the Taliban does to what happened in Oman with tribalism and having many people against the government.
I have a great respect for these people and I thank this class for helping me understand this much more than I did before.
Furthermore, if people actually cared to learn about Islam, they would encounter indisputable similarities between the two faiths.
I agree with you that all of these images really make me rethink everything I had previously thought about Afghan people.
I don't think that there are any wrong interpretations per say, but I personally do not stand for violence or hate from someone's interpretation of a religious text.
While I am sitting here trying to imagine a life like theirs, they dream to live a life like mine.
I understand what the Afghan people feel about the US and the other countries who enter into their country, not knowing what their culture is like, then thinking the Afghan people are all hostile, and that all they want is violence.
People judged them and blamed them all because some people of the same religion differently interpreted what they are supposed to believe in.
I thought that was very interesting how they have that special bond with each other.
Overall, this video allowed me to reflect on what I already thought I knew about the army, and obtain more knowledge and appreciation for the men and women in service.
In this case, it was because the Taliban were among the crowd.
They do not take into account the ways life has changed over time and how things are not so old fashion in how we live and punish and such.
How can our government stand on its principles when its oppressing a group of people instead of helping them.
Seeing small children, who dont yet understand the meaning of war and peace, causes me to feel even worse that they are suffering through something like this.
You made a lot of good points in your post and I agree with a lot of what you said!
One of the hardest things to do is to put yourself into dangerous situations with loved ones at home waiting.
These people choose our countrys safety and our safety over their own, therefore I believe we all should and do have massive respect for them.
Not for reasons to kill and fight.
The simple confusion of traditions led to the death of children who only sought out peace.
Although war is all around them, they live happy lives.
I believe our country is like this because of the awkwardness and discomfort of certain topics.
I was brought up thinking that we were fighting the Iraq War to prevent terrorism at home and abroad.
From their dialogue and answers to the questions that others ask, my perspective on Afghanistan as a country and its culture has completely changed.
Just now, I am making a generalization about people making generalizations.
Just how members of the KKK aren't Christians, these terrorists are not Muslims.
I feel that its really important to try and understand different cultures but the problem is not everyone feels that way.
I think you have a really good point here, the answer to this war is actually very complex and leads to many circling arguments and a massive headache.
No one will really ever know what the correct way to determine the meaning of the bible and verses is.
It was then I got a real lesson in what their job over there actually is.
These girls in my class definitely have prejudices towards Muslims, but I do believe it's also the teacher's fault not to teach them that an evil individual doesn't mean the whole religion's evil.
Nicole, I agree with your statement that we truly have no idea what goes on over there, and we are presented everyday with misconceptions.
Sams presentation, showing clear and raw evidence of the harsh realities that have occurred by people of each of these religions shows that hate comes within an individual and just because you label yourself as a religious person doesnt make you good.
I definitely agree with what youre saying here Juilianna!
I am a huge supporter of traveling anywhere you can because it does nothing but make you more knowledgeable as a person and is a very exciting experience.
In this era plagued with Islamophobia, closed-minded individuals tend to demonize the acts of a few to cast generalizations upon the whole.
Just because you see Christians in movies or shows and they look peaceful, doesnt mean that all Christians are the same way.
I feel like when we talk about the war, the majority of American people picture the Afghan people as some sort of monsters, but we fail to realize that they live in much the same way as we do.
In my eyes religion is something that should be completely up to the person involved.
They play, learn and have friends, yet live in such dramatically different circumstances.
I think these negative stigmas stemmed from 9/11.
If we stayed away from social media and chose to be ignorant, we could and a lot of people actually do that.
The quote from Christian Reconstructivist Gary North said, We must use the doctrine of religious liberty to gain independence for Christian schools until we train up a generation of people who know that there is no religious neutrality completely baffles me because it goes directly against what the Establishment Clause says.
Rafi showed us that the culture in the middle east is very similar to our culture and that many of the beliefs of Americans are wrong about these people.
I found this especially interesting as a Christian, because maybe people including myself go to church and follow the bible in some aspects, but not nearly all of them.
We all have jobs, careers, families, dreams etc.
They are not in combat the entire time, just like you stated in your response.
In this lecture and others, Sam brought up many good points about what we should do and how there are many laws that prevent us from doing things.
Being raised in a Christian home, I found this topic very intriguing.
All these people know is war.
So, I thought, of course all those people must be terrible human beings who support the terrorist attacks by their people.
The student continues on to relate the proxy war in Afghanistan with the war back in Oman; claiming that the war in Oman was also led by alternative interest such as the British, and the communist Soviet Union.
In the same way the confederate flag and memorials are reminders of history, that phrase on money is a reminder of what our founding fathers based the constitution on and the social climate of their time.
Sure, some people choose ignorance because they dont want to know about all of the bad things happening, but I think everyone should have a decent amount of understanding that not all of Afghanistan is at war constantly, and there are not always bombs going off 24/7.
This can go to show why a Bible based social political economic order would not be very effective.
Seeing those little girls really made me sad and feel for them.
It has always interested me how people interpret the Bible in many different ways.
I personally agree with the student and do see where hes coming from.
One war that I have heard about in my lifetime quite often is the war in Afghanistan.
To listen to a man speak who had everything stripped from him from his child, his wife and his brother is utterly devastating.
He has a family that he says goodbye to every morning when he leaves for work because he doesn't know if he is ever going to see them again.
But hearing Sam say the things that he did made me feel like I needed to be more open to accepting people, it made me feel guilty that I think I am good enough to be judging other people on things that have nothing to do with me.
All that they know is what the media portrays them to be.
So when groups of people use the bible to justify whether something is right or wrong, it blows my mind.
You often hear people talking about the separation of church and state, and how the government needs to stay out of matters that are decided upon by religion, but no one seems to actually separate the two.
A quote that I like relevant to this is The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing by Edmund Burke.
To me, this is very cool and interesting to know because I thought it was more of the complete opposite!
The media and those controlling it want us to have this type of outlook on these people.
Another reason that I think that society has this perception is because we are uneducated about the topic of the military and war.
I also think it was a good idea to aim this at college students because alcohol, for example, is one of the many prevalent things found on college campuses.
To my understanding, this program allows students from different nations to talk about the normal life of afghan people and how the war affects their everyday lives.
This shows how different each person's interpretation of the bible can be and why stereotyping people within a certain religion is so unfair.
In my opinion, this lecture was meant to shed light on the common misconception that these two religions are different and to further establish that within their own religions, people interpret the values however they want.
This is depressing that people like Rafis friend are killed.
We see this in the way new is presented here in America.
In America, a very small minority of the nation are involved or invested in the political tension and turmoil, but because that is what is exciting, the media blows it all out of proportion.
Personally, I know I'm uneducated about where I come from.
It had always been something that seemed so far away from me that I never found it of importance to learn.
Do not support the war, and even by doing that, you can help make a different.
If people put more effort into understanding the Afghani people, they may actually change their mind and want to make a difference.
Peoples lack of flexibility or acceptance is what causes this separation.
You mention that it's a huge risk when it comes to dropping a bomb.
I think this is something that not many Christians are aware of.
This part of class was interesting to me because it started the conversation of interpretation of the Bible, and how we use these interpretations to establish a society.
But they are not given that chance because the people that try to encourage peace and fight for their rights are put down.
Make sure you ask if you need to take off your shoes when you enter their houses.
They seem like they are very peaceful, which is sad because we are having this war.
This is an uphill battle that continues on every single day.
It opened up my mind to start truly thinking about being put in other peoples shoes.
But it seems we are not.
I felt that it would be the other way around, but it was not.
As you mentioned, I also live in an area where I dont have to worry about my life being in danger each day.
Sharing stories from a perspective who has personally experienced them is much different than hearing a story from a stranger on the news.
I really also appreciated how Sam put up real pictures of Afghanistan depicting the real, normal lives of the Afghani people.
In the last couple of slides, he talks about his friend Rafi Nadiri who lives in Afghanistan.
I don't think that I'm the only person who sees their heritage this way.
In America, we luckily have not had to worry about an international war coming to our country, but unfortunately that is all people, in other parts of the world, have ever known.
I also do not know what is clearly going on between the U.S. and the Middle East.
This film is about a Muslim man killed a young Puritan girl in her school.
When a white christian commits an act of terror many times it is not referred to as terrorism.
During this clip, Rich explains that when he first arrived in Afghanistan he did not have a huge idea what their culture was like.
I agree with Lieutenant Colonel Gary, that they are some of the most welcoming people.
It is a bigger and more serious topic- there are thousands of people who are hurting, stressing, in danger, and struggling.
You could tell just from Sams storytelling and the pictures that this was going to be a heavy, heart-wrenching story.
As early as January 27th of this year did the president of the United States sign an Executive order protecting the Nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States banning admission for 90 days by citizens from the predominantly Muslim countries of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
So if you're sitting in your living room with your lights flickering because the Smiths down the street just got hit by a half ton bombby accident are you going to keep eating dinner or decide to move your family.
Things have a chance of improving, I believe it is heroic for him to risk his life time and time again for his country and his family.
They even have normal shopping malls that resemble US malls.
I know personally, most of what I knew about war came from the movies and some news channels.
After all, the holy texts do not encourage the disgusting violence and killings that occur.
Men and women do not want violence and fighting.
Overall that class definitely opened my eyes to what was really going on over there and how this war is impacting its people so much.
But I would not attribute the lack of tolerance all directly to the wanting to be correct.
Also, being gay, transgender or other, not all of it brought up in the bible or Quran so what do religious people.
I also think this was a great class and appreciate all that Rafi shared with us.
I was raised to be a christian girl, however, over the years I have strayed away.
But why do we even need rules to follow when it comes to somethings?
This would be like saying Christianity believes in the same traditions as the Westboro Baptist Church about god hating homosexuals and being unpatriotic.
I havent seen anything positive on TV about this culture.
We went to war in Afghanistan because the United States as a nation was attacked in one of our worst tragedies, 9/11.
It really is a shame to be sheltered.
It will be impossible for one person who has their own interpretations and another who believes in a different way to agree on the same topic.
I found this class very interesting, because war is something that is talked about on our news stations all the time, but how much do we really know about it?
It is important to remember, like it says in the video, that these people are not walking around the streets with weapons trying to find trouble.
For example, one day you could wake up and go outside to see your neighbors house just got bombed.
And I hope that more Americans understand that these people are just like us, but were unfortunately born into the wrong place.
This discussion was an eye opener for me and I personally gained a lot from it.
And you also cannot blame those who are ignorant for acting the way they do, they know no better.
But, I am glad that our class had the opportunity to share this eye opening experience because most people do not.
In addition to those not involved in the war, there are those involved in the war, that are suffering as well.
We only see the bad poor parts of Afghanistan and hear bad things about the bombings, but there are other aspects to this place in the world that arent all necessarily bad.
Also, I feel that people fear what they don't know about or things that they can't understand.
War has a huge impact on their lives and I think that you're right when you say that we often forget that Afghanistan is real country just like us.
Although it might not seem to be an entirely progressive option at first, talking face-to-face with afghans enables a connection to be made between those involved in the conversation.
It's also interesting to see how this issue is rarely talked about and how Christians today react to Muslims.
I also really enjoyed Rafi coming to our class and speaking to us.
It can change depending on where you are in your life.
It is incredibly mature of impressive of Rafi to have reached a state of peace about the situation.
Everything helps, it is up to our generation to fix the barriers that the older generations have set up.
If this way of thinking is so commonly accepted, then what is to stop people from assuming that all Christians are hateful antisemites and racists?
government cannot start a church or pass laws that aid any religion or promote one religion over another.
Both are filled with different tales of life lessons.
I always pictured them as people who wanted war, but after this lecture I know I was wrong.
Talking about how the Bible has become the framework of moral, ethical, and philosophical ideas leaded to the topic of religious involvement in government affairs.
It is put into a bad light and many Americans are not easy to accepting it.
Both of my parents serve and I respect them beyond anything for their service to this country, but they don't need to be deployed.
They have been victim of Taliban, ISIS etc.
When Dr. Sam Richard mentioned that Rafis partner had been killed for trying to help people out, it really touched my heart.
The pictures of their malls and their traffic jams showed us that they have normal everyday lives just like us.
This topic came up during our Soc 119 Lab on Friday, and also turned into a heated debate.
Sam also mentions that just because you dont know specific Christians killing and harming people, doesnt mean they arent out there.
We all know that people everywhere have same hopes and dreams, but we don't truly understand it until we see it or experience it.
It is very eye opening to me that the civilians hate war and want it to end just as much as everyone else does.
Also, that war actually exists and that more and more innocent people are dying.
In class when we grew a relationship with rafi, i think we all realized the bigger impact the war has on people all across the world.
I never really have thought about it in such simple terms as he does.
It is saddening to know that we all are aware of the devastation that occurs in Afghanistan, but it is almost as if we pretend that it is not happening.
We take what others show us, and we don't question it, and we don't try to know more.
This means that they will use their interpretation of the religion to follow it through.
I feel like most people try to avoid the thought that war is actually happening in Afghanistan.
But Rafi made me realize that my generalizations were wrong.
It was so interesting to listen to Sam compare them.
It can be confusing because one nation may have one way of doing something and if it is not done that way it can affect the nation as a whole and go against their morals.
He finally ended by talking about ending the war.
This Clause made by our founding fathers clearly wants the public to treat the two topics as separate and it is simply wrong for certain politicians to want to bring back Christian values into schools and public places.
The people that are just like us, with the same aspirations don't deserve to live like this in fear while we live in peace.As you said most people just want to fulfill basic needs and hope to one day be alive and live in peace.
There are radical Christians too, but I think that many people forget about that and just stereotype Muslims into being radical, and not thinking about other religions.
I believe that as long as there are people like him in Afghanistan, and in the world.
There are many people out there including myself that have goals in life and would like make this country better in any way.
I said the same thing in my video response that I think the world would be a better if more people like Rafi.
This is what I dont like.
But this shouldn't be the case.
However, individuals who possess this mindset do exist.
I personally believe that the media does this intentionally to dehumanize the citizens of Afghanistan and to ensure that Americans do not protest against the war.
On a side note, I was reading about something relatable the other day that's going on in Canada.
Most people think about the military and would describe them as fighting for our country but I find it enlightening to know that they are affecting others lives in a good way as well.
The more people we develop personal connections with from the other side, the less likely we will be to make hateful or disrespectful generalizations about.
Many Americans will only watch what they believe in and what they are content with.
No conflict will be resolved if it's ignored.
Coming from my background, I know people who are not as open to biracial couples.
This is all just speculation, but it is interesting to think about.
The media wants to make America look more advanced than the rest of the world, when that is not necessarily the case.
It is easy to see that those are the people on the other side of the court and thus they must be the bad guys in the end, but being detached from a scenario isnt the same as avoiding it.
One thing you might want to add in the beginning is that LTC Garey believes that citizens think soldiers are ROBOTS!
Unfortunately, some countries might not have that and the resulting conflict/violence is then amplified by media catchphrases to demonize entire groups of opposing views.
Rafis partner was murdered for working with the people and trying to help.
They are in a war zone being killed by their own people and the U.S. military and yet they can still find room in their heart to care.
It will be easier for the Chinese students to explore other cultures if they speak their languages.
I know that just in these past two weeks of class my eyes have been opened up to so many new things and we all need to remember that they are people to with real lives just like us.
I think what Rafi and his fellow people are doing is wonderful.
I chose this video because after class it had a lasting impression on my thoughts and made me think a lot about what religion really is and how it means so many different things to different people around the world.
The Number of civilian deaths keeps rising and theyre just trying to live their lives.
We group people together who don't deserve to be groupedtogether - all Muslims are not extremists just how we know all Christians are not extremists.
I think that everyone should have a little bit of exposure to what that part of the world is like.
For me, the discussion of war makes me upset because the Afghani people are just like us but living in a war zone and have to live in fear.
The Bible will not give explicit answers for all of our complex ethical questions of today because there is no way of knowing thousands of years ago some of the ethical dilemmas we face today.
I only have immediate family in New York which means that literally the rest of my family was in Tunisia.
I grew up christian due to the fact that my dad is Catholic and my mom is Lutheran.
These lectures have opened my eyes in more way than one and have given me entirely new perspectives on war.
I also agree with you that Sams ultimate goal of his lectures is to try to get us to look at things with different perspectives.
This class definitely gave us a different perspective on how not all Afghans are the same, and some are not the cause of war but rather trying to create peace instead.
There is no version of the bible stating that people with differences deserve to be hated.
Some interpret the words (like Sam said in a different video) to turn to violence because thats what they think the bible is telling them to do, and thats why this situation is so interesting to think about.
Everyone deserves the right to follow whichever belief system they chose, and be completely safe in doing so.
Whenever I thought of Afghanistan and the war before this class, I always just pictured it happening in the middle of nowhere where civilians wouldn't be affected.
I am baffled by the fact that white supremacists are so against Muslims and Jews when in fact all of them share extremely similar religious views.
I really loved the way Sam explained the meaning of sharia.
LTC Garey had the opportunity to see their culture and was welcomed by the people.
We often don't realize how hard their lives can be.
Something that struck me while Sam was talking was that the Quran is basically the same thing as the Bible which is something I did not know.
The cultures of other countries is an extremely important and mostly neglected area of education for Americans, yet it is the best way to get the general public to be more open and accepting.
Regardless of doubt or freight I think it is amazing that goes through his mind, he remains loyal, something almost no could be able to do.
Religion to me has become so confusing because of how older generations just followed it with no hesitations, and expect us to just do the same.
They have families and loved ones who are suffering because of all the fighting that is going on.
I know I am not alone in thinking that their entire lives revolve around war.
I never really thought about there being lawyers in Afghanistan.
Glenn, I completely agree that talking aboutother races and religions is the best way to gain a better understanding of their viewpoints.
Although The Bible can serve as a tremendous source of wisdom and strength, it is by no means a book of governing laws.
Colonel Garey to class to discuss two different viewpoints on the war in Afghanistan.
Having knowledge can keep situations such as the one Garey retold during class from occurring.
The whole time I was listening to the story I thought oh the guy they finally caught is probably locked behind bars and being questioned like they wouldnt take any risks with a member of the Taliban being there.
You would not be able to tell by just looking at me.
If we take the time to be good and show respect for one another and realize that not everyone is the same, maybe wed end up in a better place.
Everyday they wake up with the fear of dying that day.
Its hard to think about that living in America.
Innocent lives were lost due to a miscommunication between the children and the American soldiers.
He talks about all the hardships that he goes through by living in Afghanistan with his family.
I was upset to hear that Rafi receives death threats almost every day and he literally has to live in fear.
I couldn't imagine living how him and his family does.
Until the rhetoric of our president changes it is going to be hard to combat terrorism in the name of christianity.
It was especially hard for me to hear that Rafi gets death threats on a daily basis and could be killed at any moment, leaving his two daughters without a father.
Many people, myself included, are unaware of the majority of the things going on in other countries.
One of the fundamentals of christianity is to never turn away those who need your help, and just through his stance on immigration, he is already violating that; its an awful contradiction.
It isn't fair to just jump to conclusions based off society's common knowledge.
I didnt even realize that they had a court system even.
They only want to show what is convenient for them.
In part, I think that is the way, as Americans, we are brought up to think.
I found it interesting that in his culture they have to make a promise at the wedding of how much money they will give their wife.
I think many peoples views on the world are altered by what we see on the media, but its important for us to realize that the media only portrays what it wants to.
I think that Sam did a very good job explaining this topic.
It must be especially hard to grow up in an area like Afghanistan where a war is currently taking place, and not even be able to understand a comfortable and safe life.
After this we had another discussion with several American students who talked about going to different European countries.
It too made me reflect upon myself and has since impacted how I observe others unique backgrounds based solely off of their physical characteristics.
We now realize that there is much more to it than to just classify someone as Asian.
With the actions of the past couple of months, it is the hope that some of the intentional ignorant see the hurt this type of thinking causes the world.
I believe a lot of the issues behind racism have to do with generations and the way our parents were raised and the way our grandparents were raised.
I for one, know my grandparents grew up believing white people were better than every other race in a way.
And I'm sure to an extent my own parents believe that.
This was definitely my favorite class so far because I thought it was the most fascinating and enlightening.
I was actually going to volunteerfor this activity since most people are wrong about my ethnicity.
I thought the group exercise of matching ancestor groups together was fascinating because a lot of people think they know your ethnicity based on just looking at your skin color or the way you dress.
I am half Cuban and half Irish but mostly people just think I'm white.
A lot of people think she's whitealso until they hear her strong accent and when she speaks Spanish.
I like how Sam picked out Jefton randomly and had him pick out who he thought went together based on quickly looking at them without being biased.
IfJeftonhad more time I think that he would've taken a closer look to see the different mix of races in people.
We don't usually admit it but we place ethnicities together on just looking at our skin color.
This activity makes people realize how diverse we all are.
Our country will most likely always have to deal with the issue of race.
The United States was built on a racist foundation of slavery.
As much as everyone would like to put racism in the past, races are not all treated as equal in our society.
Racial tensions are in an extremely heightened state.
This issue has become extremely prevalent with the recent events that have revealed the white supremacists living in the USA.
The polar opposite of the alt-right movement is the Black Lives Matter organization.
Racism is an issue that needs to be dealt with and cannot be ignored.
Every time I would wear my hair natural people would give me complements and say how much they loved my hair.
I think that it is true that everyone wants what they dont have.
This discussion in class gave me a different perspective on why my hair is the way it is.
We should all love what we were born with because it shows us about our ancestry.
Thats why I think that we should all love what we got!
I later came to the conclusion that I was incorrect.
Growing up in State College, I never really saw blatant racism until middle school and high school.
Or maybe I did see it and just did not understand it at the time.
I noticed in high school that most of the people were just ignorant to their privileges because all their friends were the same.
I agree that its hard to know for sure what to believe in terms of creation versus evolution.
All I know is what creationists believe.
It wasnt until I got to college that I really began to see the differences between the two.
So, I decided to write an essay comparing evolution to intelligent design (also known as creation) and how both theories effectively explain how we got here.
That lack of the concrete evidence assures me that creation is how all livings things appeared.
I always considered myself a very open minded person, believing we are all equal no matter the race, gender, or culture.
However, Sams talk about evolution opened my eyes because its not only the fact that we are the same in term of rights.
We all deserve equality because we are human beings.
But we are actually the same, genetically we are all literally the same species and our physical traits are an adaptation our ancestors had have to be able to survive.
That got me wondering about plastic surgeries and our constant effort to look a certain way.
Why do we all try to look different than we actually are?
Why are we never satisfied with our looks, never accepting the fact that our every trait is beautiful?
Different parts of the world have different cultures, styles, make-up, traditions, and even the food we eat.
It is important in any situation that when there is a problem, it gets addressed.
Over the past few years, however, there have been many instances where African Americans were wrongfully fatally shot or beaten by police without probable cause.
I think that we need to have a balance between talking about racism and making sure that people are aware of it, and not talking about it to the point of causing tension where there doesnt need to be any.
The video I chose to respond to what Are Sports Inherently Racist?
Im sure anyone could play and get good at any sport but our athletic abilities have a lot to do with our genes.
Not only does race play a part in sports, but it is also a cultural thing.
Basketball is a common sport in the south and is played mostly by black people because there are mostly black people living there.
In the United States, too often you turn on the television, radio, Internet and hear about riots, protests, and deaths as a result of racial issues.
People are uncomfortable to talk about race because they do not want to offend anyone.
If we celebrate our differences and speak about them openly, then we can better understand each other and our attitudes about race will shift.
If we are educated on race, we will be more inclined to stand up for equality when we hear racial comments.
I am a junior in college, and this is the first time I have taken a class on racial relations, which is absurd.
Since much of the population has not grown up in a society where talking about race so freely was the norm, we often brush our questions regarding race under the rug.
However, I believe we need to ask questions because that will lead to more knowledge.
When it comes to the discussion of race, I do agree with you.
Topics among people should always be discussed with a large group.
I agree with your statement that it seems that so many people are closed minded, as it is true.
Many do not listen to others, and it makes it seem almost overwhelming with how much discussion is going on without the intent of learning, and instead having the intent of winning an argument.
I picked this video because I never knew humans are 99.9% the same.
He explains the reason why some people have these different features and how it is because we have adapted over time to different climates.
At the end of his demonstration, he reminds us that these differences only make up .01% of us.
I found this to be very intriguing because the DNA test isolates certain genes that only exist in certain parts of the world and if they are found in your DNA, they will show up on your test.
I thought this was a very interesting topic as well.
I would think that after a few generations of living in the US, their features would eventually change and adapt to the new climate.
I also think normal noses are based on social norms.
The person with the larger nose probably is from somewhere different where larger noses are normal to them.
There is a reason why sitcoms use interracial relationships as comedic relief.
They give off this vibe of awkwardness that comes from the fact that in todays world we pick out interracial relationships in a matter of seconds.
It is something we, for the most part, all pick up on but we never talk about because that makes us uncomfortable.
Sam analyzes every little detail and is able to identify people based on traits specific to certain regions and ethnicities.
For example, the KKK rallying in Charlottesville is alarming to me as they protest about white supremacy.
Therefore, those who are trying to make the argument that their one group is better than another is left with an invalid argument.
I think it is clear that all humans are created the same.
I can confidently say that I know people of almost every race that are rich, poor, upper class, lower class, smart, dumb, gay, straight, male, female, religious, nonreligious, democrat, republican, and the list goes on.
Their race has nothing to do with their place in society.
Its 2017 and I still cant get over the fact that our world is still struggling with these race-related issues.
Hi Dan, I feel like your perspective is very interesting as it comes from a complete opposite place from me.
For international students verses United States students I can usually tell, but not from looks more from clothing, mannerisms, and obviously if they have an accent.
Finally for my understanding of china, to me it seems just like any other country, but that means that I really don't have a great understanding of it.
For this weeks discussion I am responding to a video from Day 2 entitled Evolution in Sociology (link below).
Knowing that all humans have 99.9% of the same genetic makeup means knowing that there is not a single race that is superior to another.
This is an upsetting thought, but its the truth.
Taking a look at movies and magazines and other media, we see mostly white people.
I really don't think that this should be surprising or really unbelievable.
When discussing race, there's always going to be that bad connotation with it.
Focusing on the future of America is all that we can do.
Race will always be a big deal in America.
What we have to work towards, is getting the focus on the positives over the negatives.
I'm sure that it is unique for people who aren't from here to come and experience this big racial topic in America, but they also aren't used to having these different groups together.
By embracing these differences and celebrating the fact that all of these ethnically different people can coincide, we show off our dominance.
I have a large and very close knit family, the smell of chicken soup is almost always permeating throughout my home, and I went to an overnight summer camp for 7 weeks for the past 10 summers of my life, which, I have gathered, is something overwhelmingly specific to Jewish families in the North East.
Truthfully, I have never given religion a chance.
Never once did I think that these stories had any semblance of truth.
For example, the Torah portion I read to become a Bat-Mitzvah was Noahs Ark, and I never considered that Noah could have lived to be 950 years old, in my eyes that was completely impossible.
To generalize, it seems like the discussion of equality has spiked dramatically since our generation spoke out, but in reality, the idea of equality is just being redefined.
Most races, generations, and other groups have their own ideas of equality, and although equality should mean equal, we often treat the word to mean balanced with the idea of equality.
For example, today we believe slavery is a prime example of the inequalities between whites and blacks, but at the time, white people believed that they had the correct balance of rights.
By a click of a button, an opinion on race equality can be shared with the world, and news corporations have more power over the people than ever.
No doubt that both small and large groups of people are being noticed and going to use modern outlets to try to increase their rights and fight for their idea of a fair balance.
Coming from a country that has already come to an agreement on their idea of race equality, it may be difficult to understand why Americans are always trying to redefine theirs.
In the video that I chose, Professor Richards acknowledges the widespread discussions that constantly go on throughout society regarding different ethnic groups.
However, it is very obvious that in the United States, there are lingering diversity issues that are not always addressed.
During lecture, Mr. Richards claims that some people might not think there is a race problem because they personally have not talked about it.
It is easier to identify difficulties by analyzing behaviors or contrasting our racial issues to other countries, which should be done verbally.
Mr. Richards uses the example of an American visiting Colombia, where the citizens may not believe there is race problem.
People claim that we should stop talking about race so much and that we should just move on from it, but we cant move forward until the matter is solved.
Showing an acceptance and embracement for diversity through discussions will put us in the right direction towards solving it.
We should try to acknowledge varying perspectives of race and come together to all jointly have a positive outlook towards diversification.
Even though we are in an America that claims to have equal rights for everyone, there is not really equality.
Someone is always going to feel superior to others.
This was a very fascinating topic to think about for me as well.
I am shocked that this is not taught in schools earlier, and I believe that it should be.
If it is, I think we will prevent a lot of racist thoughts from happening in the future.
Although race was talked about a lot in my town, I believe it needed to be addressed even more.
But it needs to be addressed in an informative matter so they can see that just because they come from a different place, does not mean that they are less than you.
I think that this problem extends well beyond the classroom as well.
People do this because they know that posting rude things does not result in immediate repercussions like saying them in person does.
Personally I believe that it depends on the situation.
I think that it should be talked about when a problem arises and race is thought to be a factor.
I think that far too often people attempt to apply race to a situation that it shouldnt be.
People apply race to situations and create race problems where there isnt any.
America itself has had many problems with race, from Native Americans to foreigners to religion.
Race should only be brought up when it was a factor in the first place, such as a hate crime.
We shouldnt apply race to every situation involving people from different racial backgrounds.
Similar characteristics that separated say people of Italian descent from English descent separate people of African descent.
Originally I expected this venture to be more of a lesson in identifying people, but instead the way Sam lead it was perhaps way more impactful.
Meeting and interacting with people is another gateway for this, really noticing the small things about the way people look and linking that with their ancestry gives us a tool to better understand the slight differences among us and the reason why we have them to begin with.
Now that Sam made me more aware of the evolutionary differences we have thanks to our ancestry, I really think it would be worthwhile to get to the point he is at, where you can look at people and see where they are from, to have an idea of their lineage before asking about it.
Individuals such as Richard Spencer spend their time traveling around and speaking with communities about how white people are above all other races, therefore giving them the upper hand to dominate society.
This particular sociology 119 lecture brought to light the ignorance of common people such as Richard Spencer.
The ideology these men carry with them is biologically inaccurate.
Scientists and psychologists have devoted countless years of their lives to study the human mind and consciousness.
Evidence has been found to support the conclusion that human beings are fundamentally ninety nine percent the same and share the same thought processes.
After viewing photos of starving children in Africa or homeless families in India, it is a natural instinct for people to assume that they are not equal to populations like that.
The photo's are not in society's face like the one's from third world countries are, but that does not mean they are not present.
I believe that more people need to discuss the fact that human beings are fundamentally the same.
Sam dug up his ancestry and learned he is one percent Sub Saharan African.
I am confident that racist individuals such as Richard Spencer would be stunned to learn that he too most likely has a sliver of African DNA.
Feelings of superiority could be diminished if society would take the time to educate themselves on their own background and the background of others, humans are more alike than most people are aware of.
Sam put up images of individuals who had similar appearances.
He asked the class to differentiate between Native American and Siberian, Native American and Chinese, and Chinese and European.
Or, if it is really that hard to tell the difference.
As people migrated across the earth, some people stayed in one area, while others continued to new regions.
This means that people from varying geographical locations share the same DNA.
The way this class was structured was fantastic.
It showed that people really do not know what people of different ethnicities look like.
This was shown when students in class were not able to differentiate between people of different origins.
Most people would probably think it would be very easy to tell the difference, but a lot of people in class got this wrong.
It all made so much sense when he pulled up the map and showed the migration patterns.
He talked through the example and showed the arrows, which explained why people from some areas look so similar.
Thinking about this in relation to the activity where Sam had the guy group people based on appearance.
Thinking about it now, knowing that entire ethnic groups can look so similar, makes this task seem even harder.
I think this activity would be beneficial for most people to be a part of.
I think it displays the point very well that people are all in fact just people and that the differences are just in the DNA.
Treating people who may be different than you as humans instead of animals will help lead to problem solving and understanding.
This also leads to the point that exposing people to other ethnically different people at a young age can help with this.
While I was from a smaller, white community, my city was very diverse.
So, once I got out of my neighborhood I was able to interact with many other different races and grew accustomed to some of their traditions.
While I do think there is always going to be a difference between races, understanding and education help decrease that gap.
I completely agree with what you said in your post.
I am aware that it is important to watch the news daily to stay in tuned with what is going on in the world, however I rarely turn on the news and I know many of my friends rarely watch the news either because its never on at my apartment.
That may be a result of how convenient it is to just find out what is going on via social media today.
It goes along with the saying agree to disagree.
In this circumstance, Hayden was extremely brave for voicing his opinion in a respectful matter in front of a huge audience of students.
Hopefully, Sam pointing out that student's opinions like Hayden need to be respected, stops something like that from happening in the future because social media platforms like Twitter can be extremely beneficial for engagement, especially in this class.
This is why I think it is important to discuss it more openly so that we can respect and learn from one another.
I think that not talking about race only makes the problem worse.
Nevertheless, race should continue to be discussed.
I think it is important to acknowledge the many different races that are what make up modern-day America.
I also found this part of class to be very interesting.
Evolution is about survival of the fittest so the fact that there are many different races still existing today means that we were all fit to survive and all evolved equally.
When you first go there, all of the roads might look the same and it might be easy to get lost.
For example, I probably would have guessed that Jeffton was of African descent, when hes actually from Haiti.
I think where I was from, people were typically grouped into a few select groups; white, African(American), Asian, or Hispanic.
Though, those groups are broad, they definitely fail to capture everybody or classify them accurately.
One point that would like to mention is that people tend to speak their minds more over the internet than in person.
In class, Dr. Richards brought up the point that people tend to shy away from fully expressing themselves when they are in the presence of people who they are not fully acquainted with or a vast majority of people.
I come from Mexico a really small town and everyone down there looks just like me.
But stereotypes do exist.
The majority of people that have the power are mostly white.
While I was only 25 minutes outside of one of the most diverse cities in America, the town that I grew up in was very far from diverse.
I believe that my graduating class was 96% caucasian.
If I had to guess a month ago, the difference between native Chinese and American Chinese would be dialect and voice, however, now I know that the distinguishing factors are more cultural and based off of style.
I also got inspired with the fact that mixed races are the future.
Every single day we are exposed to diversity and we have learned that our reality is not the same as others and that is something we should respect and just like you and me, we should appreciate.
I think in order for us to accept our differences, we have to educate ourselves of such.
I completely relate to how you feel about gaining knowledge in something that you feel passionate about and not getting so caught up in what your final grade is on a big exam.
Sams lecture is definitely relatable and hopefully opened the eyes of some students to be motivated to major in a subject that they value.
It's extremely hard though because it is such a difficult topic to discuss and everyone has their own opinions on it.
For example, take someone who grew up in a small town in the middle of nowhere.
That person is going to have grown up being influenced by the people they were surrounded by.
You look at a lot of people who grow up in small secluded areas in the United States and not too many of them ever leave that area.
They are born and raised there and then they settle down there.
Although Im not sure, I speculate that a lot of the prejudice comes from familiarity.
If you are an employer with two applicants of similar qualifications, but one is black while the other is white.
How do we fix this issue?
I also found this to be very interesting.
It is something unique that is a direct result of your ancestors.
I am open to admitting my own ignorance, and this is definitely a portrayal of mine.
Being completely honest, I never took the time to genuinely notice facial features of people who are a different race than me.
Sam has a keen interest in noses so I think it's cool to view how noses evolved in different ethnicities.
I very much like what you said about the ignorance we hold as a nation, I believe that we have a lot of misconceptions about other nations, formed purely from ignorance.
Through these tools, capitalism has been allowed to enter the realm of opinion.
Those with favorable opinions will be encouraged to exist, whereas those with unfavorable opinions will be rejected outright by the average consumer base.
This could result in the creation of an echo chamber in which is only the majority opinion will be voiced.
However, to those true seekers of knowledge out there, social media will present an environment of constant challenge and debate, thus making the educational experience one which constantly tests the foundation of ones belief structures.
I as well found this part of class to be very interesting and would completely agree that there is a lack of discussion about race in grade school.
I had always thought about how awesome it is how there are accents everywhere, and since I was young I constantly wished I had one as well.
My Penn State friends have pointed out to me how I say certain phrases that are unknown to them, and how my dialect is sometimes very different than theirs.
I am from North Jersey, while majority of my friends live right outside of Philly.
It is intriguing that different places have different dialects because of the people they are surrounded by, and by how much they venture.
I have started to pay closer attention to my friends appearance and their ancestry, and it is fascinating.
Additionally, I have never travelled outside of the country besides to Cancun in Mexico, but I have been to many states in the U.S. where cultures are different.
I have family in Minnesota and Washington, and my best friend at Penn State is from San Diego, California.
The final thing that Sam went over was his own DNA test showing the regions were his DNA meets the unique gene markers.
The fact that the gene markers for Africa is so prevalent that it survived thousands of years to be detected by a simple DNA test.
As an American, I do not necessarily think that America is the great country in the world.
There isn't one particular country that trumps the rest.
I found the reasoning behind the different accents and how language is such a dynamic entity very fascinating.
When he explains that people did not travel very far and accents were slowly passed on to other people it made me still question why the accent would change.
I also wonder why people developed different languages as a whole if language is passed down?
I have never really thought about it before.
I have never actually thought about it in this perspective before.
The video that I'm doing my response on is the Mixed Races are the Future video which I will link in the post.
The reason why I decided to do my response on this one is because this is something that I saw every single day before I came to Penn State.
As someone who wasn'tborn in this country, I felt like I could always relate to and be friends with people who weren't necessarily 100% American or 100% white American because we had something in common.
This type of outlook is what I hope everyone has in life.
I believe that a person shouldn't decide to not have relations with another person solely because of their background.
You are only restricting yourself by only dating someone from your own ethnicity.
I think the millennials in America has been making great strides towards acceptance.
On a national scale, race is discussed and is a very heated topic.
There is rarely ever talk about two races ever getting along.
Another big problem is that whenever something bad happens a lot of times people try to make it into a race issue and that makes the situation more heated.
There is still a lot of racism in America and I do not think it will go away any time soon.
I think we were making great progress with fighting racism but with how prominent media is in everyday life I believe the negativity travels quicker which causes the racism to spread extremely quickly.
As a country, I believe we need to discuss race under a better light and I think that will help lower racial tensions and bring us together.
People of any religion, race, or sexuality can be a terrorist and Sam shows that through his examples from ISIS to the white man who shot up a church of black American people.
Additionally, one thing that really hit home was the map of hate groups in each state.
After class, I looked more into it and found that New Jersey was in the top five of the states for hate groups.
Another thing that kind of frustrated me from Sams class was the man who was a Jehovahs Witness who did not go to his daughters marriage.
I cannot imagine how terrible his daughter felt because it was her big day and her father did not go.
When he said this, it stood out to me because he views academia the way it should be seen.
Applying to college, its as if the only thing that really matters is what the admissions office sees on your transcripts and essays.
I chose this clip mainly because its something I can relate to very well.
My biggest takeaway message from this clip was that its okay to go against the odds, break away from the norm, and take your own path.
My mothers side of the family originated from Sicily, Italy so growing up in that environment admittedly made me very narrow-minded and it wasnt until high school where I finally was exposed to another race other than Italian.
My family strictly follows Italian traditions and strictly judge other people who are not Italian.
When I say judge I mean they dont get understand why other people dress, shop, eat, etc in a different way then them.
I believe god to be a creator of life but doesn't interfere with the natural laws.
This belief is called deism.
Something else that I don't agree with is how people differentiate religions and faiths.
Every religion moves towards making up someone's identity and helping them to lead a happy life in unity no matter what beliefs they follow.
So there is no point in discriminating and imposing superiority.
However, when it comes to relationships I don't think race should be an issue.
I think that being able to understand some elses culture is the most beautiful thing.
In a way I feel like dating someone out of your race can be a way to end racism.
Throughout Soc 119 I know we will be talking about very real social issues which can sometimes be hard to discuss.
I dont think its fair that people were attacking him via twitter because all he was doing was answering the question he was asked in the best way he felt possible.
During this discussion, Sam mentions how sports could be a cultural phenomenon and a result of different body builds from different parts of the country that inhabit people of different skin colors.
I believe this is very true.
In many parts of Ethiopia, there are people struggling to provide food for themselves, for their families, let alone purchase anything remotely unnecessary.
So, while yes I believe some of the athletics is due to body build and body type, I think a lot of it comes from economics.
In the world we live in today, I think people are very cautious of what they say and are worried they are going to be judged for their thoughts and opinions.
I think this is a very interesting topic.
So I think I had lots of experience with different belief and religions.
I view religion as a way to seek help when peopleare in the worst situation of their own.
I agree with what you are saying here!
I also found it so fascinating to learn that many of our facial features and other features really just come from our different ancestors.
I also agree with you that it's very empowering to know this because without all of our different features our ancestors wouldn't have survived.
I completely agree with you that race is both talked about too much and not enough in different situations.
On the other hand, it should be embraced and spoken about.
I really liked how you brought up the fact that people do not fight over other peoples differences in hair color, but for some reason the color of their skin changes their whole perspective on things.
I agree that the idea of white supremacy is a huge social issue right now.
We, as humans, are more alike than anyone realizes.
Just what Amanda said in her reply to your post, Madison, I too was about to be angry at your response, but as you continued into the second and third sentences, my views changed and I understood where you were going with your thoughts.
Saying we do too much talking and not enough doing honestly gave me chills because it is so true.
I don't think that anyone knows how to do that, moreover I don't even know if it's possible.
I truly don't know either, and I wish I did.
I thank you for bringing to light the same questions I think to myself about racism.
After this class, I realized, similarly to you, that those who think differently than the two of us have their own reasoning for their actions.
In the video, I was also shocked when Sam touched on the realization that the most evolved species (all the way to the right) in the evolution diagram was in fact, white.
Every race believes they are the superior race, and this is why all of the disconnect and hateful nature come into play.
I thoughtthis question was interesting as Americans themselves view America as the greatest country in the world, yet our country is still plagued with problems that many countries have already dealt with.
This coincides with the mass genocide the migrants from Europeinflicted on the Native Americans in the United States.
However, I think the ability to understand and empathize with other cultures and religions is stagnating in the United States due to the fact that our country was built on the foundation of inequality, as stated in the video.
I think there are too many cultures and opinions today for the government to accommodate everyone, until the moment the U.Sgovernment takes actionand reverts tradition to appeal to the changing times of this new technological era.
Response:In sports, often a region or nations reputation is held up by the performance of only a few very talented individuals.
These athletes are quite literally the exceptional; their athleticism puts them above the rank and as such they are analyzed by others to see how that talent can be developed.
It is easy to look at a roster on the NBA and point out the obvious trait that well over half of the players are dark skinned.
But outside of cultural outlets leading them to that sport, it could be possible that there are other less noticed traits leading them to the top.
was brought up, the answer seemed quite obvious to me.
The United States, since the beginning, had been a country which held large amounts of slaves.
However, since this was not the case, white people saw themselves as superior to black people.
Also, since slavery was more popular in the south part of the United States, we find that, today, there is more racism there than in the north.
These types of people all have white skin, but were not considered white to the Americans living in the United States.
I can personally connect to this as my grandparents were born in Poland and moved to the United States around the 1950s.
I have recently talked to my mother about how she feels about not being able to learn the language which the entirety of her family speaks, and she seemed disappointed in my grandparents decision.
Now that Polish and Irish people are considered white people and are less stereotyped, she wished that she could have embraced her heritage more.
Before this video was the activity where one student had to try and place a bunch of mixed race students into groups of similar backgrounds.
These students volunteered because they knew that their background was very hard to guess.
I thought that this was the most interesting and entertaining activity shown so far.
I was impressed how close the student actually was with placing the other students.
In this video, Sam showed two girls that the student placed together and how they had very significant differences.
I find this very interesting and I think it needs to be more known because most people now have mixed races and it is important to know that just because two people have the same color skin, it does not mean they have the same race or background.
I know that personally I would have been very bad at this activity because I am not educated in anything talked about in this video.
He also mentions that people of the same race will be able to tell that they are the same.
I do understand and agree with your point.
I think some of these characteristics are seen as abnormal, because many European features are seen as more of the norm.
I think because we live in America more of the minorities features are seen as abnormal.
I also found this lecture in particular to be very interesting because I never knew that noses were so distinct from each other.
When he described the purposes of each kind of nose, I was very surprised.
I honestly thought that a nose was just a nose and all it did was really help for our sense of smell.
When Sam brought up Manan, I did not know that his type of nose had a specific purpose.
In a colder climate, his longer nose is able to have some more time to warm the air before it hits the lungs.
With that in mind, our phenotypic differences serve as beneficial mutations to aid in our survival.
The fact that one individuals skin tone is fairer, suggests that the individual needed more exposure to the sun and vitamins and could achieve that with a lighter skin tone.
In my opinion, it is this kind of thinking that is really limiting certain individuals and groups of people from the same access as others.
We talk about why some sports seem to be mostly made up of a certain race.
This is an interesting question that I think has multiple aspects that can have an impact.
Anybody is allowed to play any sport.
Even though there is some information to support the idea that the physical aspects affect the difference of the two sports I think most of the difference comes from the culture that different races typically grow up in.
In class we used the example of what type of posters do kids have in their rooms when they were kids.
This is an interesting topic that I had never thought about in this way.
Everyone I know has a mixed background, and it leads to people looking different, but potentially having similar characteristics depending on their genes.
When Sam was describing how he can look at differences in people in other countries like Haiti, I realized that it is something we can probably all relate to; most people I know that have Irish blood usually have freckles, including myself and many of my friends and relatives.
This compared to a basketball which costs at the most 30 dollars.
Socioeconomics has a lot to do with what sports people play growing up.
For baseball I wanted to play 1st base and I batted left handed because I wanted to be like my favorite player on the Phillies Jim Thome.
My point is that we look up to people that we can identify with.
There are not many people in northeast Philadelphia that would one be able to afford hockey equipment, and two a lot of people look up to people that they can identify with.
Where one grows up has a tremendous impact in their focuses in life.
It makes sense, dont get me wrong, but the idea that Sam can tell what part of the world a person comes from with enough accuracy to be impressive, just by looking at a particular facial feature is all types of wild.
But, this could definitely be my conspiracy theorist Mr. Hyde showing.
If Sam is being one hundred percent legitimate however, this is an incredibly cool concept; that even without knowing ones ancestry, much can still be gleaned from using only a visual standpoint.
I agree with a lot of what you are saying.
The bible in my opinion is taken way to seriously and people internalize and try to implement everything in it.
I'm sure that was not the purpose behind it.
I think the bible should be treated the same way.
Take the good messages out and leave the rest.
Don't just do everything it says.
There is nothing that makes people better at one sport versus another.
This difference could help in the different climates these sports are played in.
You need to be adaptable to cold are if you play hockey and the opposite for basketball.
Basketball was created to have an indoor sport to stay in shape during the warmer months.
There is no geographical favoritism for this, so I am not sure how this could have effected the demographics of the sport.
One thing I found interesting in class that someone brought up was the socioeconomics related the sports.
Now I am not agreeing 100% that this is the case for the demographic differences, but this is something that my dad brought up to me once, even though looking back now, I know he is not the most racially accepting person.
I think that using social media in a class of this size is beneficial because it gives everyone a voice.
I think that as the semester progresses, everyone in the class will become more comfortable speaking about their beliefs and will begin to understand that there are going to be disagreements within the class.
Sam says that his main goal in the class is not to impose his own opinions on us, but rather to help make us think and formulate our own opinions.
Sam has done a great job so far in getting us to talk, but I believe that the social media aspect of this class is really what can catapult the discussions to the next level.
Our brains have developed to categorize things to streamline the thinking process, but what is the benefit of creating assumptions about another person just based on their appearance?
I feel like as a whole, our society can get too hung up on peoples differences, making it very challenging to see past them.
Whereas here, Sam tells us to start noticing them more.
Picking out every single little difference between ourselves and any other person can start to get mean and nasty.
I'm from Boston, and sometimes my accent really becomes apparent.
But for the most part, when the word wicked slips out into conversation, most people will say oh that's so cool, you must be from Massachusetts!
It's never in a rude or belittling way, but more as a topic of conversation that others want to start to get to know me better.
But even coming to Penn State from Boston has been a change in scenery and culture for me in many ways.
Meeting all new types of people, seeing more hills and open space I've honestly ever seen before, and living in a state I've never been to before applying to PSU.
I was never thinking about the money issue until that one student said it and it did almost make sense but then you mentioned football.
It made me think about how a lot of white people play soccer and that requires very little equipment as well.
I believe that sports are not a racist thing also.
I just believe people play sports for two reasons.
I have a lot of tall white friends though who play basketball.
This discussion was very interesting and your response was very good and made me think a lot.
In addition, there so much more to every country and culture, and I end up thinking that if we were open to learning about other countries, this can even be a solution for the problems that we have faced throughout history.
Hi Morgan, I also found it incredibly interesting that the source of a lot of discrimination came from an issue related to proximity to a line on our planet.
I agree with your analyzation of why we don't date outside of what we are comfortable with.
Differences do not mean that we have a right to treat anyone maliciously, instead they should be embraced and acknowledged.
I really agree with your point to talk about race more often.
In Sam's class we have been talking talking about race and he has been educating us on different races around the world.
or I am going to protest this class.
I also agree with you on you point to stop being colorblind to race.
You are absolutely right in the sense that race will never go away if it is ignored.
It is a blessing that we can live in a country with this much diversity mixed together.
Unfortunately there are still those who find a problem with this and lash out at races as a whole with ideas that are off base.
Throughout history humans have been discriminating against different races and nationalities.
As you said we are a melting pot which brings several different races together in all types of environments.
It still feels fresh in the mind of America and because it has never been properly addressed by the nation.
I definitely agree that we do not pay enough attention to detail.
People also always look at me and assume I'm only Italian but I'm actually half Puerto Rican.
From the clip, this is most likely my favorite quote from Sam, even though I disagree.
The downside to giving all students access to the same open forum is the sense of anonymity.
Sure, each person's name (usually) is on their twitter, in a room with over 700 students, you can safely post anything and get away with it.
While its reasonable to expect a classroom to have better etiquette than this, I my belief is that there exists no classroom with 700 plus students that can use twitter, or any form of social media, without a few people bringing each other down.
Looking around 100 Thomas, I saw a sea of different faces, ethnicities, races, etc.
Last semester, every single class I was enrolled in was in 100 Thomas.
I jokingly asked if advisors recommended this class for International students since they have such a presence.
Numerous people agreed and made the same remark and said how they experienced the same thing.
We all discussed how they looked at their different classes and never noticed the difference between International students and U.S. students [unless they spoke a different language or had an accent].
I honestly do not know the difference between to the two before this class.
We see too often riots occurring in cities because a race issue that has been blown up exponentially by the media.
Everyone had their own opinion, but the opinions that are being formed are becoming to radical and are dividing the country down the middle.
He rebelled against his strict Catholic upbringing and developed a strong distrust of religious institutions which he tried to pass on to my sisters and I.
I have never identified with any particular religion, but instead have tried to learn as much as I can about all religions and practice meditation and mindfulness in order to foster my sense of connection to life and the universe.
Along the way, I have found a community of open-minded people, many with different religious beliefs.
But we are all connected by our faith in something bigger than ourselves.
I know that I believe in evolution.
But to hear Sam say that he has talked to God and a minute later say that he does not believe in God made me feel like I am not the only person whose beliefs seem to contradict themselves.
I think your post is very important to reiterate why we have adapted to different climates and how our bodies have changed.
The mono lids that many east Asian people have may have been part of an adaptation, be he explained that they were merely spread throughout the culture because a trait that people liked and reproduced through breeding.
Other than that, you post is spot on.
One of the main reasons being I was an important part of this experiment when it was brought up in class.
It was definitely fun but also quite an experience, especially when you're in front of more than 700 people and they're all watching you.
It's true when they say appearances are deceptive or don't judge a book by it's cover.
I think the student did a exceptional job to a certain extent, in dividing people into race groups based on certain external features, from his perspective.
Thus, this was a very interesting way to learn about mixed races, giving a completely different perspective to it.
Nevertheless, people should not forget all the racists acts that happened in the past, address these issues in order to move forward, and make sure the closed- minded mentalities are being demolished as the world moved forward.
I agree that I also would be surprised seeing a black or Asian male or female on the right end of an evolution chart.
Knowing this ideology makes it impossible to think that one group is scientifically better than another group; the hardest part is to get people to understand.
This then ties back to the media influence depicting white people.
This is something that over the years I have found to be very true in terms of social media as a whole.
You do not need to deal with the immediate response and the look in the person's eyes.
I am the type of person who excels in face-to-face conversation because I am comfortable having a normal conversation and do not feel like I need to use social media as shield to put others down.
This lesson shocked me so much because I always knew that these people existed, but seeing so many of them come together in big numbers and rally in Charlottesville disgusted me.
Unless you live under a rock you clearly can see that there are plenty of injustices taking place all over this great nation.
I have never experienced racism towards me, I couldnt possibly understand or say I know how he feels.
Another reason I believe race is such a huge topic in the US is because of how diverse the country is.
If we continue to turn a blind eye, things will get worse and worse.
In the video, Arsh says that the Indian Government admitted their wrongdoings and tried to rebuild the relationship between those affected.
I believe if we want to make headway on this race issue our government needs to do the same.
As mentioned in other responses, I too felt personally attacked by the idea that as Americans we are trying to get it right.
Then I got to thinking about why people take actual offense from a simple misnomer, as though being misconstrued as another race is insulting.
Following this slide, a picture of four black NBA icons is shown.
Why do we categorize races in relation to athletics?
Is it culture like Sam says?
Growing up, I participated in soccer.
Soccer is a dominant sport in countries throughout Africa, which could be argued to be cultural as it is a configuration of value that is learned socially in these areas.
To me, it seems as if culture is undeniably seen as racist whether it is intentional or not.
Before coming college, I had never really hadheard racist remarks before.
It really disgusted me after hearing a student freely drop the N word last year.
I agree with you that race is frequently talked about on the news.
It has to be in order for people's messages to be heard.
I personally don't think its discussed enough though.
I don't think people actually realize including myself how big of an issue it really is.
If you have lived in the same area all your life, how do you know how other places and people behave.
I think people need to step out of their bubble in order to realize how other people are treated.
As we mature into adulthood we increase our knowledge and our understanding about this subject.
It becomes clearer that groups of people are suppressed and nothing can be done unless the issue is put under the spotlight.
Many factors can influence this process; that is why there exists both similar and completely different cultures around the world.
When I say factors, I mean the location, climate, genetics and so on.
In my view, this process of originating and consolidating cultures is no longer possible because of technology and globalization.
In fact, many traditions are being lost and the way people think and do things is getting more similar as time goes by.
Nowadays, it is much more common to find people from different cultures in the same place; for example, here at Penn State.
On the other hand, genetics is something that cannot be changed by technology.
I found the video really interesting and one can notice how experienced is Sam about these kinds of topics.
If I had to do the exercise, I would have failed tremendously.
So, the person that did it, did a great job doing the exercise without offending anyone.
This exercise and lecture was one of my favorites so far because like I said previously, it allowed me and everyone else to see that a group of people can look very similar and be from very different parts of the world.
Dr. Richards explained that two key events in American history have resulted in race having such a controversial and important role in today's American society.
It was surprising to learn that there were 556 Native American tribes recognized by the Federal Government.
Native Americans are often left unrecognized and do not have a very prominent voice.
I find it very unfortunate that we do not hear more concerning the struggles of Native Americans.
This being said, there are definetly some atrocious events that tarnish the reputation of this country.
I would like to disagree with the student who compared India to the United States.
Also, I believe in recent times, this country has become more polarized, especially with last years election.
Groups of races often try to place the blame of problems on each other.
It is important to gain perspective and knowledge on both sides of the argument in order to understand the groups.
I believe, that because America is perhaps the most diverse nation in the world issues are going to present themselves.
However, many people in all race groups are very stubborn and very rooted in their believes to even consider the other side and resort to violence to prove their point.
Leaders of all the races have to work together to mediate the racial issues we face.
I think that in America we are taught to say African American because it is the most correct.
I wonder how this terminology comes across to individuals.
I really liked the comparison you used about Thailand and Japan.
It is a little bit extreme, but I think it really brings the point across.
You also talked about not noticing the differentiating features of black people.
The way Sam compared their features made the differences really stand out.
It made me want to look at myself in a mirror and see what distinguishes me as an African American.
It is a huge part of our nations history and it is important to discuss the problem in order to prevent it from happening in the future.
Sam also mentioned how there are many critics that suggested that Americans talk about racism too much, yet many people may think otherwise.
He said that there are two types of people when it comes to talking about racism.
There are those that think we talk about it too much and those that believe we dont talk about it nearly enough.
If we continue to educate people on our nations history, there is a likely chance that history will not repeat itself.
I was eager to discuss this issue in lecture because I do think racism is still around this nation and it is constantly a problem for many people.
but humans tend to become stereotypical; which is completely normal.
Most people come from backgrounds that consider their tribe or color for example to be more superior than others.
I think people should keep an open mind about races and try to judge people based on their effort not by looks or race.
One discussion during class that sparked my interest was the discussion about why race is still an issue in the United States as opposed to other countries.
In the video, one student who spoke on the microphone explained that we are constantly changing how we view race, which I agree with.
I think that race is still a very prominent problem in the United States.
I think that our current political leaders contribute to an inappropriate and non- progressive dialogue between white and black people.
With these things still happening even after our country was founded on these prejudices.
I think that opening up a dialogue about race and directly addressing it can help the US to make progress.
Your experience on this subject is so cool, and its startling how different it was from mine growing up.
I am one of those people that had mostly not interacted with people of other races (in school mainly) until I was in college.
I am white obviously, and I grew up in a rural area of Pennsylvania.
My high school was small and there were probably about 6 people in my graduating class that were not white.
It's definitely just where you grow up that shapes your experiences.
On the subject of mixed race, it is comforting that the population of America is increasingly mixed; this seems to me like it is a big marker of the changing attitudes on interracial relationships.
Your stance on weather being a factor was a very interesting take.
That's true that basketball courts are very common in warmer places because warm weather means more people being active outside.
But in today's age i feel that indoor hockey arenas are much more common than outdoor rinks.
Everyone of my friends who plays or have played hockey before said it was always a rare occasion playing at an outside arena.
I feel that the main difference in that hockey arenas take up a lot of space.
When you drive through a city there are going to be 10 outdoor basketball hoops scattered everywhere, compared to maybe one hockey arena or outdoor skating rink.
This is on the lines of what Hayden was talking about in class.
Convincing arguments can be made for both sides, and there is no clear answer.
Others believe that the discussion is unavoidable and by talking about race, we become more comfortable and openminded.
However, in countries such as India, there is little talk about race in the same way that there is in the United States.
In other countries, sometimes the problems associated with race are not as acknowledged because of the lack of these conversations about race.
I think the debate in the United States over whether we talk too much about race stems from the fact that it is such a complex and detailed subject that it seems overwhelming at times.
Just 19% think the level of discussion of racial issues is about right.
It is important to educate younger generations so that they can understand that it is not about what a person looks, but how they act is how a person is defined.
It puts down the other minorities because it is saying that Asian Americans are able to live the American dreams and that other minorities are slacking.
To educate yourself on something such as history could very well enable you to make at least one valid point.
Ideology consumes the heart of ones being, when the individual refuses to consider their own ideas as flawed.
Furthermore, since the Russians, technically, won WWII should their extermination of their own citizens go unpunished or no, because they won?
To ensure we are free from the possession of ideas is to become surrounded by those with opposing viewpoints.
It is somehow our reasoning for why the NBA is mostly black.
Very rarely do we have people of black decent playing hockey.
While I do believe genetics plays a role to an extent, I dont believe that is the full story.
If we stick with hockey and basketball as the example, think of the climate they are played in.
It is hard to play basketball outside when the ground is covered in snow or ice.
Therefore, you could conclude that basketball tends to be played in warmer climates.
Hockey, on the other hand, is played on ice.
Granted, with the way things are today, it is mostly played in indoor arenas, where the ice is made.
However, before that it had to be played somewhere that ice could be available naturally, therefore hockey tends to be played in cooler climates.
Hockey equipment is expensive, along with the travel expenses because there are not a million hockey teams locally to always play.
A hockey rink needs to be rented out by the team.
This is because so many different views and thoughts make more than enough sense when taken into consideration.
I think that What it ultimately comes down to, however, is belief.
As Sam Richards pointed out, people could be categorized on what they believe happened: creationists, theists, naturalistics, and atheistic.
I believe that there indeed is a god and that ultimately, he guided the process for the evolution of humans and the rest of the world.
Of course, god did not guide the process step by step, detail by detail.
Because of this, science was able to play a significant factor in the evolution of humans.
This was scientific fact that is hard to be disputed against.
As I said before, belief plays a significant role in how the world, humans, and everything else was created.
Some people don't even believe that there's a god.
This would just leave it purely up to science to be responsible for evolution and the way the world has become today.
Others believe that god created us the way we are now and that evolution did not exist.
I don't know about that, because like I said before, there is solid evidence of evolution, dating back hundreds of years.
In the end, it won't matter because differences in belief will always get in the way.
, I agree with Sam Richards that this is largely in part from the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, and I also think that it comes from the fact that America was built from the institution of slavery.
Going back to the Jim Crow Laws, there was a misconception of separate but equal when it came to education, power, and opportunity between whites and blacks in America at the that time, and the Civil Rights Movement challenged this notion for better change.
The idea that race is still a problem in society implies that discrimination is still also a problem in today's issues.
Some argue that police officers are abusing their authority of power and often times targeting black people with questionable motives.
If this were not the case, I think there would be a lot more instances of protests against police that would eventually lead to government intervention.
Seeing news of police officers shooting people with a subjectively lower threat spreads a narrative that law enforcement cannot be trusted as much anymore.
I do not see the issue of race leaving in the near future, and what has happened in the news shows that more should be done by the police and government to heal the divisions of the past to serve the present.
I found this discussion to be very interesting as well!
I am also from the Boston area, and although there are definitely certain words and phrases I say that people here have noticed as a Boston thing, my accent is no where near as strong as some of my friends from South Jersey and Philly.
At the same time I disagree with why you thing race is talked about too much.
In order to spread this idea of equality I think race need to be talked about more openly.
It got me thinking, but I personally have to say that I don't think sports are inherently racist.
It is simply much easier to start up a basketball game than a hockey game.
Hockey games require much more equipment, from the skates to the protective equipment, and in addition to those, you need to know how to skate, which depending on the person could be really easy or really hard to learn.
To play basketball, you only really need to know how to run and be able to bounce a basketball.
Obviously, some people are really uncoordinated, but generally speaking, it would be much easier to start playing basketball than to start playing hockey.
I would love to see the look on someone's face when shown this clip just how wrong they have been for so long.
To some extent, I disagree with what you said.
I really liked this post because you said what we are all thinking.
Its not fair to any of us that we have been conditioned to tiptoe around the subjectlike this, but we are.
This video clip was definitely one of my other favorite discussions we had in class, apart from the one I talked about.
This topic was discussion caught most of my attention mainly becauseI was so heavily involved with sports throughout most of myschool life.
This is heavily based oncertain physical features, especially their built and bone structure as compared to most of the other people from around the world.
You raise a good point but I partially agree with you on this one.
I understand that a lot of us have experience problems like racial slurs being thrown (even as a lighthearted joke) and that is not good at all.
On that point you raise a really good point in the question you ask, when will that happen?
This was such an interesting response to read!
Since coming to Penn State, I have become involved with an African American who grew up in New York.
I think its important to know why we look the way we do.
People have their own opinion on human evolution and parents teach their kids what they believe to be true, mainly from their religion.
I love how Sam can talk about it so freely and I wish schools were taught to do the same because its an interesting topic.
Allowing students to openly talk and be knowledgeable of this subject will help end ignorance and racism.
The groups I made were completely different from the groups on the stage, but they were even less accurate than the inaccurate groupings in the front of the classroom.
Dr. Richards asked each of the participants about where their ancestors were from and some of their responses really surprised me, but what shocked me even more was how easy it was for Dr. Richards to recognize where peoples ancestors originate from.
Dr. Richards said that it was easy for him because he can recognize features on a persons face and classify where their ancestors are from because he has traveled a lot and seen a lot of people from different places.
Since this activity has occurred, I have noticed myself being less quick to guess or classify people into where I think their ancestors are from, because I learned I was actually really bad at it.
I do believe that we are not born racists.
It is something that we are subconsciously telling our children and the younger generation that some races are lower than us, and because of this there is a gap within America.
By gap, I mean that there is some sort of unwritten competition amongst all the people.
America is supposed to be the melting pot.
People are afraid to talk about race because it is one of those unwritten rules that one should not say.
It is important to educate the younger generation of today that the color of your skin does not define the status or the worthiness of that individual.
As a practicing Catholic, I understand the strict values and set of beliefs that the church expects its members to follow.
I also understand that not adhering to every belief forced upon me growing up was difficult to come to terms with.
She asked me if I wanted to disprove God, and I cried.
I didn't want to upset my mother and I didn't want to abandon my faith, but, as a scientist, I wanted to pursue truth.
I wanted to know how the universe began, how it evolved, and like every other human on this earth, I wanted to find meaning in it.
My belief system is complicated.
That was hard for me to accept, but it has defined me as an individual.
I still regularly attend mass because it makes me want to be a better person.
I also think the disparities are greatly influenced by culture.
In class we discussed that black people might not have the same opportunities as white people when it comes to sports like hockey because of the expense of the game but if black people really wanted to play hockey they would find a way.
This immediately caught my attention because accents fascinate me.
I am from New Jersey, and many people at school think that I have an accent.
When they say this, I look at them with a confused expression because I do not think that I have one.
In my area (Central NJ) it is exclusively called pork roll.
After watching this video I realized that people around my county may have certain ways of saying things/words that are native to our area because people have been locked into our particular area, creating a specific dialectic.
The main objective of this video was to start looking at people deeper than identifying them as White, Black, Asian, or Hispanic.
We need to start looking at people and recognizing their facial features that link them to their ancestry.
At the restaurant I work at over the summer, my boss hired a new boy.
I noticed he would always look at people very intensely, but I never knew why.
I had no idea how he knew this because I had never told him I was.
It amazed me that he could piece all of my facial features together and determine my ancestry.
Facial features all have a purpose and after taking this class I hope I can learn the distinctions between different backgrounds.
The video that I chose to write a response on is Pay Attention to Distinct Differences.
I really liked this video because I think it is so interesting how accents, dialects, and facial features can help people distinguish where their ancestors are from.
I also think that it is cool that by using these features, people can tell where other people are from as well.
It has always been obvious to me that accents and dialects can help distinguish where people are from.
I have a lot of family from Boston, Massachusetts, so I grew up being around the Boston dialect, and hearing my cousins use the word wicked to describe things or pronounce car as cah.
I have also been told that I have a slight Philly accent, which I did not know I have until I got to Penn State.
I am from outside of Philly, so my accent is not very strong.
However, my friends tell me that I pronounce family with a Philly accent.
One of my best friends is from Long Island, and she has a very strong accent.
I think it is so cool how each place has its own individual accent or dialect, and how each one is unique and distinguishable to someone not from that area.
I also think that it is so interesting that this extends beyond just the boundaries of the United States.
It is one thing to be able to hear the difference in accents and dialects, both nationally and internationally.
It is intriguing to me that something as simple as the shape of someones nose can help someone figure out where their ancestors are from.
In the hot climates the hair is tightly kinked because it is limiting the amount of heat it absorbs while protecting the head.
I was surprised with the students comment that UV radiation can impact the brain just by standing in the sun.
It know makes sense to me that where you live greatly affects everything about you like your hair, nose and eyes.
I was surprised when Sam mentioned that the tight kinks in hair is so the heat although it is reaching the head it does not reach the scalp.
The difference in hair between all nationalities can be seen very clearly but by taking it a step further and seeing that it is all due to location makes sense.
This lecture proved to me that evolution created all the differences between humans and that it was for our own protection.
The differences in climates around the world have shaped us to who we are today.
Anybody, can present their personal opinions and thoughts on race into an argument, but its is hard (if not impossible) to argue against facts.
Humans have evolved different traits in order to adapt to their geographical environment, however, I do believe that humans have developed societies and cultures in those environments and are often discriminated because of their physical features for this reason.
I believe many Alt Right group members would be shocked to find out that they are very genetically similar to the people they hate.
I understand that race is a really big deal especially with all the racial injustice that have taken place in the last coming months.
However, every time I turn on the new now a days all the stories are involving race.
I feel like it has come to be all that is talked about.
Even when I watch ESPN race is a big topic that is talked about.
Every time I here them talking about Collin Kapernik and him taking a knee during the national anthem.
He is currently not on the team and many seem to believe it is because of him taking a social stance.
I understand that this a topic that needs to be talked about but it feels like too much.
People have been trying to have peaceful protest regarding race and they have ended up turning violent due to backlash.
I see what Sam is saying when he talks about both sides having a really good argument.
Then I started to see race in my high school.
Not to mention the white people were also broken up into subcategories like drama club, nerds, ROTC, delinquent, and popular kids.
I have thought back to my behaviors in that cafeteria often.
I remember fluttering around the room to the different groups like a social butterfly.
I would always eat with my nerd friends first.
(Please reply if anyone did this.
At the time, I was not even conscious I was crossing normal high school boundaries.
Loved to talk to people.
To get to know them.
To really connect with them and let them know I cared.
I see it as time I do not have anymore.
I am always wrapped up in my own world now.
How it happened I am not too sure, but I know am aware to the fact that it happened.
Personally, I want to reopen the doors to the barriers I once was blind to in high school.
I hoping SOC119 will give me the tools to be able to do this again.
I also found this lecture to be very interesting because I too can similarly relate to this topic.
I was also the first person in my family to get braces and attend private school so I can see where we have some common ground.
One example that you pointed out was if someone's teeth are crooked or straight.
You also mentioned how Sam spoke aboutwhite supremacists and how they may believe that they are a part of a more advanced race.
All of those theories can easily be dismissed due to the fact that DNA testsexist.
And I can definitely understand your view that we talk about race too much.
But I disagree with you that race issues cannot be solved by discussion and raising awareness.
Everything we learned was hard for my teacher to articulate because, as she said, you will never truly understand it until you live it.
She had told us the best life lesson she could give us was to tell us that in order to learn the ins and outs of something, you have to completely immerse yourself in it.
I remember when my friend was in Afghanistan.
I was beyond worried for him and his dafety, and he was even worried for himself.
If we never talked about race issues, Martin Luther King would have never changed the world with his I Have a Dream speech and we would still have segregated bathrooms.
Ive decided that I believe it is crucial we talk about race.
Though the times are different, we cannot change our past.
Even though parents today may be less racist than their parents, children are still going to learn about their countrys history, and for good reason.
Focusing on our improvement and talking to one another like were all the same is completely ignoring those who are still suffering from stereotypes and violence from white supremacists.
I agree that the blunt way this discussion is led makes the class environment more open for discussion.
This class is so informative and has already taught me more than I thought it would the entire semester.
The numbers don't lie.
Like you said humans are 99.9% genetically the same.
I agree with your point when you call the United States a melting pot.
It is important to understand that America is full of people of all races and that lead to conflict.
Racism has evolved for America because our country has changed a lot.
But its also interesting because it is an approach which can expose stereotypes.
Im not sure why they laughed, because I think she makes a very good point.
It helps white men in power to objectify women who are foreign to them, instead of trying to understand who they are.
It definitely added some hardships and turbulence in our relationship that I had not experienced before.
It even led to some issues of communication which I think unfortunately added to the eventual dissolution of our relationship.
Matt, I agree that sports aren't racist at all, it's just that people make them seem like they are.
For instance, do you remember that student in class who was a tall, black man and Sam said that the sport he played was hockey?
People thought he played football and I think a lot of people were shocked because of this preconceived idea that if you play a sport, you must have a certain color for it.
I think that's another thing that people don't understand about sports and skin color.
People just have this idea stuck in their head that your color must match your sport.
We justify our supremacy over other nations by depicting other countries in a state of vulnerability.
We mainly consider European countries to be our equals because they, like us, have a large population of white people.
Most of the countries that we depict as being in a state of vulnerability and poverty are mainly nations that have a large population of people of color.
The United Arab Emirates is one of the richest nations in the world and far richer than the United States and there are several African countries that have a higher economic growth rate than we do.
I think Sam covered the most significant reasons for this focus on race when he mentioned the Native American genocide and slavery and the fact that we as a country have never really come to terms with either.
I think that as a whole, our schools can do a better job teaching us about the full extent of slavery and genocide in the United States and its effects on Native and African Americans.
I also think it was interesting what was said about how a lot of the founding of America was tied a lot to slavery and racism and how the constitution was written in a way that excluded minorities.
My grandparents immigrated to America from Italy and I know that they dealt with discrimination and racism.
This racism has been directed towards every new group of immigrants that comes to the United States, from Italians and Irish in the past to Middle Eastern and Islamic immigrants in recent years.
Like your Grandma, my Grandmom was raised thinking that interracial couples were not acceptable, it was the ideology of their time period.
Then I asked myself why I had never when I find people of color just as attractive as my own race.
Like they say, opposites attract!
By introducing incredible African American athletes into these professional sports, the leagues became much more competitive.
The first thoughts were white people were better adapted to the cold or the Kenyans had naturally better cardiovascular endurance.
That is when Sam introduced the idea that different body types were the most important role in how certain cultures are more adapted to certain sports.
On a demographic note, hockey used to be only a cold sport started in the north for most of its existence, until recently.
The opposite is true for African Americans since they lived in warm regions, where a hoop and a ball, or a football, was all they needed to play.
With all of these different ideas floating around about why different cultures are better at different sports, I believe it ultimately boils down to the different body types.
To be a great NBA player, one usually has to be tall and quick.
For a hockey player, height is not a major factor, where strength and speed are.
Where as a white person tends to have shorter legs with a longer torso.
This body type is better suited for a game like hockey, where leg strength is critical to be a fast and strong skater.
I couldn't agree more with you Alexandrea.
I chose this video because I think that it brings up a very important topic that is not talked about often enough in American history.
We often don't even talk about racism against Native Americans because it is an uncomfortable and embarrassing look into the racist past of America.
There are almost 600 federally recognized tribes and I can't even imagine what it would feel like to live in a country that has murdered millions of your ancestors.
This can definitely cause a feeling if disenfranchisement within the Native American community.
I feel like there are leaps and bounds that America has to make in order to even come close to solving the race problem right now but a great first step is opening a dialogue between many different communities.
The best way to hear other communities problems is simply to be willing to listen and provide a way to voice concerns and work together to overcome the systemic racism that we all have come to know in America.
And like Sam said, no one really would venture far from there which is something just realized.
So it wasnt until I first came to college when I realized that I speak differently.
I have never been out of the United States.
But I am part Italian and Irish so I resemble people from those countries in a way.
In this case, the genetics of individuals are 99.9 percent the same, which means that people from a different race are born with almost the same genetics physically, but how does this affect different races mentally?
Different cultures have different values which can also impact a humans personality, for example, asian cultures value humbleness while western cultures value confidence.
Another part of the video I found interesting was the discussion of class differences.
I agree with Professor Richards that there are class divides in America.
However, would people from a different race, income bracket, or political group agree with this statement?
Would people from a different background even take the class divide as seriously?
I am from an asian background and I found that the class divide is taken very seriously in India.
In India there exists a caste system and people who associate with others from a lower caste are ostracized.
Reading is awesome, cant argue with that.
Its not a bad idea to challenge the norms of our education system, and there are certainly problems with things like tracking where students get lost in a sea of bureaucracy.
Im glad that you found something positive in Sams teaching, as that is something which I am struggling to attain personally.
I understand where you are coming from.
Some kids are just simply not introduced to some sports and that is why it may seem that everyone in that race drifts to a certain sport.
I do agree that society puts us in a box but I think it's in a more deeper way.
Society is not just saying that black people are good at football or basketball but it's putting these opportunities into our communities.
The places that we live dictates what we are exposed to.
As you can see, there wasn't a large array of sports for my classmates and myself to choose from.
So, on the surface it may seem like people of the same race are just good at a certain sport but in actuality it's what they are exposed to.
More exposure to one sport will cause people to be better at it then others for the simple fact that they practice more.
This is just the preferable body type in that sport though, and Sam mentioned in the video that anyone can mostly achieve that body through training.
Now, if you take a deeper look into this topic you'll eventually start to think about culture, and why the sports are so popular with these groups, discounting body type.
For hockey you need a stick, a puck, a goal, skates, pads, a rink to play on, rink time, and so on.
I was expecting her to say an answer completely the opposite of what she said.
I personally believe, its rare for a white guy to like a black woman.
I think we tend to intimidate them and dont come off as approachable to most of them.
Ive heard that in other countries black women are more appreciated by men of other races than here in America.
So I believe her answer maybe could have worked if we were speaking of white men specific to some other countries.
In my 20 years Ive only had two white guys ever show interest in me.
I could possibly encounter a guy of another race that completely changes my perspective on this topic, but as of now an interracial relationship would not be something for me.
With the direction our country is going, I find it very difficult to not assume how most white people feel about black women and men.
Im not saying this mentality is at all right, because not all people are the same.
To avoid all of that I choose to avoid dating outside of my race.
These things are the reason why we have classes and castes.
Another example that relates to this is the genocide that occurred during the holocaust.
The Nazis believed that blonde hair and blue eyes were the superior qualities of the master race.
Looks should not define your class because internally we are essentially the same creatures.
I found this topic very interesting because race in the United States of America is one of the mostcontroversial issues today.
People are often reluctant to share their opinions about race in fear of offending someone.
There needs to be more open discussions were these race relations issues can be solved.
Professor Richards stated that other countries such as India and Venezuela have major race issues, but they justrefrain from talking about it.
Venezuela and India have problems such as colorism and caste systems ingrained in the culture.
It's one of those topics that gets pushed to the side.
All in all, I do not think race and race relations are talked about too much.
I think you have a very interesting point when you say that depending on the sports stars in your area thats what sports are most popular there.
I think this makes a lot of sense.
The change started to progress in my parents generation, or what most would call the baby boomer generation.
I feel that this is the same for people that care about marrying outside your gender, but that's a topic for a different discussion.
He went to off to Ohio State and now has had a black girlfriend for 6 months.
I agree with what you are saying!
I think that increased structure is something that would eventually happen over time, it just took a lot longer in those regions and happened earlier in Europe.
You make a good point when you say that Race can never truly 'go away,' because it evolved in order to allow for human survival.
I think cultural and societal values will continue to change as cultures begin to mix more and more.
I feel that over time, we will begin to see these become more uniform throughout the world due to interactions of different cultures and human populations.
I grew up in Panama and finished high school in Florida.
For me it was very interesting being able to witness two different cultures and specially speak a different language.
At my boarding school in Florida I was able to meet people from different places in the US but also from around the world.
Living in the dorms you get the opportunity to meet a lot of people and from that opportunity I was able to realize how sometimes we judge cultures without even talking to a person.
But from getting to know this people it made me see that we are not too different from each other but also at the same time we stereotype and misjudge people.
On the other hand, living in different places gave me a different view on society and life.
I think that specially being away from home and growing up by myself I was able to see peoples different perspectives.
Do you and your girlfriend have any opposition from both your parents about the race difference?
Also, did you personally have any cultural barriers in your relationship that you had to overcome?
I am currently single and looking to travel a great amount after college.
I am curious to know some challenges that I might face and ways to conquer them.
It reminded me of a National Geographic article I read.
I was able to find it again if you wanted to have a look.
I agree with your response entirely and I think that America's troubled history is definitely the source of many of today's racial tensions.
The problem that then arises is how we could work to relieve these tensions and understand every communities' views.
I believe that the first step that we should take is to open a dialogue for every community to voice their concerns and provide ideas for how to better their lives.
I firmly believe that the only way to connect communities is to allow them to have a productive way to voice their concerns in an attempt to fix them.
Being able to talk to people who are not like you and have differing views is also a great way to open the eyes of some people who only see other communities as statistics or blips in a history book.
I agree with you that its easier for similar people to see the differences in people like them.
However, I think that when you point out the differences and especially bring several different people up ask them what the differences they see you see them easier as well.
I like how you mentioned about how many people lump all of Africa together even though their culture is more diverse than many places around the world.
Personally, I believe what we talked about in class is true.
Hockey is played in colder areas where ice rinks are more accessible.
However, I wanted to add a possible reason as to why this racial divide exists.
I believe it also lies in the upbringing of todays youth in the United States.
For example, many of todays NBA players including LeBron James are raised in poverty of the inner cities.
This creates a restraint on their possible ability to play ice hockey because of the natural fixed costs associated with the sport.
Going back to what we talked about in class, I agree with the fact that professionals in the NBA and NHL are equally athletic and strong.
So, if you dont start at a young age, it is very difficult to catch up with everyone else.
The fact that those living near the equator were the darkest because of the amount of sun rays that hit that area of the earth, seemed very clear to me after Sam stated it.
I also find it interesting that even though someone may have dark skin, they might not have grown up in the area where the most sun rays hit.
Personally, I have the mindset that we are all the same, just human beings who might look a little different, but when Sam asked Melanie to do this, it almost pulls you out of the mindset that we are all the same.
There were other black people who did not volunteer themselves like this though, which is interesting in the fact that even though some people might have the same skin color, they are not the same at all.
The video I chose was Mixed Race Groups Are the Future.
I thought this was a interesting topic to discuss due to its controversy and taboo associated with it.
We are observed to be different simply because of traits that we inherit due to geographical differences.
This is the trend we have been seeing as people migrate to other countries to live out their lives.
What I am seeing now is that the generation in my family that grew up in America is marrying into families of other races.
This will evidently lead to babies that are going to be mixed.
The activity that was done in this video was also very intriguing.
There are new terms already stemming such as Indian or Asian American.
During this lecture, I was pondering the same idea.
I then put myself in their shoes and asked myself if I would have felt uncomfortable in either situation.
There are beautiful people of all different races and their uniqueness is a part of the reason they are so beautiful.
This is why I believe that I would not be upset in either situation.
I liked how Sam made a point to say that when he looks at a person's physical features, he sees his or her ancestors.
I want to see people that way as well.
I agree with everything you had to say.
My brother is very Italian looking however hes gotten asked if he is Mexican.
He has also gotten asked if one of his parents is Black.
You say in your discussion that after this video and the class you started to see the world differently.
I am Chinese, and we are always mixed up with Koreans and Japanese people.
For me, there are some things that I look for that help me distinguish between the three.
Just between these three it is hard to distinguish sometimes, which is why I find it crazy that Sam can distinguish between a large handful of the races in the world.
I think that it is a really cool thing.
I personally feel that mixed-race would produce more cultural awareness rather than a loss of culture.
I really like the idea of mixing race, because we really can share and learn a lot from each other.
As people start grow older and graduate high school and finally start to get out of their bubble that they most likely lived in, I think it is important to try and travel or try to meet new friends who have culturally different backgrounds.
A little kid who was eight years old in Ethiopia knew the amendments of the United States.
This kid lives in a completely different continent, in a country where they had only been in school three or four years, and he knew way more about the constitution of the United States than me.
I wish more people were like that kid because he had a thirst to learn and he was open to learning about a different country and culture other than his own.
To conclude, I think it is important for people to go and see the world from their own perspective and maybe people will receive a better understanding about each other.
I agree with what was said about why certain races play certain sports was a cultural reason not a biological or racial one.
So, I feel like no certain race is more advanced to play a sport than any other race.
I think professional athletes are more advanced physically than regular people and could play any sport that wanted at a high level.
I also feel that what sport you play has a lot to do with where you are located geographically.
If you look at a sport like football, there is more of a balance to the amount of pros from each state.
I have played on sports teams my whole life with people of all different races, religions, cultures, and economic status.
I feel like none of that matters in sports and everyone works together to achieve a goal and be the best team possible.
When the Cleveland Browns took a knee during the national anthem you could see it was a mix of races protesting not just of all one race kneeling.
I feel as though I have an internal crisis every time Sam says something thought provoking.
A time that I felt this way that really stuck out to me was during the Evolution of Skin Pigmentation discussion.
When Sam walked over to a girl and asked her to volunteer, I was surprised to see that he picked my friend Melanie, who I had a few classes with last semester.
When he asked her to pick out the darkest skinned person in the class, I and many others audibly gasped.
I began to get so nervous for her, wondering what she was going to say, or even if she was going to do it.
Then, when a boy volunteered himself, the mood in the room lightened up significantly.
I began to think what I would have done in that situation if I was the one asked that question in front of 600 people.
Why does it make me uncomfortable to point out someone with the darkest color skin color in the room?
Sam often talks about white shame in class and I was never fully aware of it until that moment.
I never played hockey myself, but a couple of my close friends have and like you said, they were at tournaments every weekend and constantly needed new equipment, which can cost thousands of dollars in the long run.
I am hoping that I will be able to accomplish this through a study abroad program at Penn State.
There are no real differences between races, everyone is equal.
I believe that the racial difference between sports is completely cultural.
This is because they are built better and are naturally going to be better runners than someone not of black decent.
We all have learned of slavery and its detrimental effects on particular communities within America, and majority of us condemn racial discrimination.
It makes me sad to see that people were saying mean things about someone that was brave and trying to make a thoughtful point and allowed us all to learn and benefit from it.
Caucasian is the dominant race on campus and everyone on campus tends to make friends with other students that are like them.
People do not like things that are different from us, it is just human nature.
Joshua, I totally agree with what you are saying.
Some of which, are often linked to a certain race (African-Americans and socioeconomic status).
What Ive come to realize is that any productive discussion on race must also include a discussion about economic inequality.
Even though we learn as a child to not judge a book by its cover doesnt mean it stays in our brain forever.
But I think one of the biggest problems is that people don't know how to talk about race, so we take the easy way out and don't discuss it.
That's the only way our nation can avoid repeating negative history.
It makes perfect sense that people develop a dialect unique to their geographical area.
Anyone who plays sports professionally is a freak human being because of their athletic abilities.
I also agree with you that understanding is a very vital part in communicating with anyone.
Since America is a melting pot of people, I wonder if those physical characteristics have gotten watered down for lack of better words.
Everyone is guilty of passing judgment on a person from just looking at them for the first time because everyone has biases.
Its rare for us to see that the taliban and terrorist groups over in the middle east harm the people over there as well, probably even more so.
I have had a similar experience.
I like this class because it opens up our thoughts on topics that are controversial, but also being able to talk about it in a safe environment.
People are using platforms, such as twitter and Facebook, as ways to send hate and harmful messages without ever having to face anyone face to face.
It was interesting to see what white supremacist rationale was to support their racist ideology.
There is no doubt I picked up small variations in my speech patterns and how I pronunciate my words.
You would have to keep people from playing the game to make it racist which isnt the case with basketball or any other sport.
What sport a child chooses to specialize in depends on their interest, skill, the popularity of the sport and in some cases economic ability to pay for said sport which includes if it is offered at their school.
When the hockey originally became popular, it was obvious that a lot of equipment would be needed, and the only way you could play the sport was in the cold, considering it is on ice.
I think basketball takes a higher precedence in the inner cities due to the fact that you do not need much equipment to play the game of basketball.
In America, African-Americans are incarcerated 5 times more often than white people.
For example the Japanese Americans during WW2 who had no part in the attack on Pearl Harbor but were mistreated and stripped of their American citizenship and put into concentration camps.
Understanding is a vital tool that I feel should be utilized more in the world today.
I believe that to glance around a room and ignore the color of skin or the things that make us different is an insensitive way to look at the world.
I hope that, with time, more and more of this sensible topics will turn into something that society doesnt feel afraid or uncomfortable with.
Looking at the races of indigenous people shows that the races of Europeans have a percentage from Africa.
Simply put, sticking with what you know is easier than sticking your neck out.
I also started out this class in a bad mood, stressed out over something that had happened earlier.
Race conversations come up and people do not even realize it.
I also agree when you said that sports have a lot to do with where one is located geographically.
(The school did not change his living situation and the two boys are now best friends.)
It would be unfair to say that it does not still exist.
I think a lot of people do not realize that we are less than 1% different.
Hello Ashley, I also chose this video because, like you, I agree with what Sam says about race.
This is not a country I am proud of.
I also really enjoyed this discussion because it provides an opportunity for this class to discuss more things that we normally wouldn't like maybe ears, or cheek bones, or eyebrows.
I think agree with Sam that we should be able to talk about the differences in the way we look because it is just genetics.
I do think that racism is worth talking about but I believe that the way we discuss racism is not the most effective way.
This also spills into the real world and how different looking Latinos are treated here in the United States.
I was very surprised to learn about some of the student's background during the activity.
I believe that many individuals are hesitant to do this in the thought that they will offend others, or possibly use incorrect terms to describe their appearances or even ancestries.
While we have a majority of white people it is slowly decreasing and we see more races come every year.
I think your first point, about how people are more likely to gravitate towards sports with stars that are most similar to them, is spot on.
When we first discussed this topic during class, I was very interested.
I know they have distinct features that separate them but I do not know them that well.
I remember moving into my freshman year dorm at Gettysburg College, a kid down the hall from me had his grandparents come along with his mom and dad to see his dorm room.
We are so used to looking at people and acting like we know everything about them before we talk and get to know them.
Everybody gets so defensive and offended about attributes that they personally cannot control which leads to a defensive lifestyle and makes others extremely cautious in what they say around others.
In simpler terms, I am pasty all year around and others are not.
I thought your post was very insightful and I enjoyed reading about your personal experiences of dealing with racial differences.
The best reason for why this is true in most cases, is because most black women would feel as though they are not truly accepted into the world of a white man.
When I said talking about race I meant having intelligent conversations regarding the topic.
Growing up in this conservative area, it's easy to let yourself fall victim to the brainwashing we're taught, but it's so important to do some research, through traveling the world, or just looking things up, in order to gain perspective, if after all the research you still want to believe America is the greatest country on earth, fine with me, but I won't allow myself to see America as this perfect place.
I think the United States could be a bit more deliberative and careful in the way we deal with race.
I believe the idea of white people are the most evolved is the root cause for racism and white people privileges in the United States.
The United States has never addressed its horrific past and the systematic oppression of marginalized people that continues.
I do not agree with what they did, however, that is because I was raised differently.
By what standard do we define an ideal diverse society without a true standard?
However, we also grow up in a society that values sticking with what we know.
I personally think that in order to understand others better and ultimately end racism people need to discuss issues and confront the problems.
Subsequently, like any average human would do, we negate our problems and let them fester.
Things like reforming our laws and our police forces to combat racial profiling, establishing a more equal and fair education system to ensure that impoverished areas arent stuck in a perpetual cycle of subpar education, etc.
World War II was solely based on the exclusion and execution of jewish people.
I agree with what you said about how we're uncomfortable to point out things like dark skin to other people.
America is one country that has a big problem with race.
many US Government Official are aware of the Social Benefits of the compensation, but are afraid of its Financial disadvantages, hence they have to give money from their pockets.
Russel Wilson, Tim Tebow, even Michael Jordan attempted to play multiple sports, and it didn't work.
The United States needs to find a way to cut the tension so we could freely talk.
In the video the person speaking in the beginning brings up the point of how in India race is not as big of an issue.
He says that as a result, people will find ways to place themselves above others in their own heads.
Equal in the sense that we are 99.9% genetically the same person and are only differentiated by our physical appearances.
Having a big nose has been something I've known I've had since I could remember.
I haven't traveled much in my life though I hope to get the chance too.
It wasn't just white people, the majority of dissent came from the Indian church my mothers family was a part of, who believed she should be with an Indian man who shared her religion.
People of color are still marginalized in their daily lives.
I agree with everything you have said above.
Sure, we all can follow our own practices and believe in what we want to believe in.
Some people try to explain the race gap in sports by physical differences within different races.
It amazes me how, in this day and age, educated Americans can base their beliefs on apperances.
I too do not think that sports are inherently racist.
That is where I think racial intolerance stems from and in my opinion the only way for people to see people with a different set of eyes is to sit down and actually have race discussions.
Thats all we really get to see.
Many times people think badly of other races simply because they dont know people from that given race.
Like he said, experiencing this other culture doesn't mean you just sit on the beach of a resort.
If I ever have a question about someone's cultural, I ask, because I feel like that's more polite than remaining ignorant.
Most black women do not ever seek romantic relationships with white men.
Throughout history these faiths and beliefs have fueled entire civilizations and been cornerstones of all if not most of them.
I do not understand why race is still such a conversional issue in our society today.
He was not that cautious with everything he was saying and some people in the class took offense to what he said.
If we all are 99.9% the same, why do we choose to focus on the 0.01% that divides us?
I hope society can move past judging people just based on the way they look.
The fact that so many of the protesters were young white men who have grown up in an era where diversity is celebrated and honored, tells us we have a long way to go to be educated about race.
However, the discussion needs to center around how we solve the problem on our hands.
In this video Sam asks a couple students to explain what race most people are in each sport.
I grew up in Ecuador and I have been able to witness race discrimination in various forms and ways.
Silencing the discussion of race will never help us solve any of our problems and will only continue to silence a group of individuals who have been wrongfully oppressed for years.
I think there are multiple answers.
He is promoting that we should be proud of ourselves and our physical appearance because it is our story and Ithink this is the way everyone should think.
Anyways trying to tell all the Asians apart was definitely going to be challenging because they all look the same to me.
You can back this reasoning as many times you may see players who change sports and do pretty well in both like Bo Jacksonor hall of fame tight end Tony Gonzalez.
Despite all of the negativity that can be put online, SOC 119 is engaging its students and giving us the opportunity to positively express our thoughts, opinions, and beliefs.
I missed class to talk to the shc associate dean about it  that was my experience as a Freshmen at Penn State.
My response to that is India has a far more homogenous population.
Social media has become one of the most powerful ways of communication and a great way to voice ones opinion.
I know that it is a lot easier said than done, but I also feel like the issue will never be truly be resolved.
The psychological needs of a human are all the same, people should show more empathy towards one and other in order to bring society together rather than farther apart.
Same thing for the Native Americans, they did not receive any sort of compensation for the genocide they have experienced.
The class exercise really opened my eyes that we are all equal and there is no such thing that white people are most evolved.
Also, I love the fact that you want to help fix this issue and youre not willing to just be a bystander.
It showed that you went beyond just the video/lecture and took the initiative to learn more about the subject.
It's always been something that we've been encouraged to learn about in school but it's never been an easy topic to discuss.
The baby boomer generation was taught to recognize the differences of skin color in a negative way.
It did not take much to notice that this man is deeply affected by what is going on in his country and culture.
I think traveling the world candramatically change our perspective of the world.
After listening to Sam, I now have different thoughts since I am looking at the topic with open eyes and open ears.
I think you made a lot of good points in your discussion, especially about news networks being biased.
Because of history, there can never be an ideal world in which race is not a factor that we judge someone by.
It is absolutely undeniable that police brutality has always existed.
The most insane part of their ideology in my opinion is that they think they are able to accurately put specific numbers to certain groups to describe where they are in the evolutionary process.
We spent almost two weeks of class calling black people, brown people, etc.
Ive never been to Italy, but Ive talked to my dad a lot about his experiences.
Most people like me make assumptions where people are from due to their accent, and sometimes I can't even figure it out.
People living in the warmer climates did not have this problem and so they retained the wider noses.
I really enjoyed the activity we did in class of comparing people's facial features and genetics.
If they would sit back and realize that just because something about them is different than how we live our lives.
Why do people divide each other?
Also, so many hispanic people play soccer because soccer makes up a huge part of the Spanish culture.
Also, I find this to be true in life in general.
The student named Arsh made the point that India has less issues with racism, even though there were more recent genocides based off race in India.
I believe there will never be a point in time where everyone is understanding of other countries practices, so as individuals we have to be willing to accept the viewpoints of others and hope that will be enough to prevent feuds between groups.
When you think about the hundreds of generations it took to get us where we are today our bodies and are skin color should be a symbol of pride.
America has changed a huge amount when it comes to race relations as compared to 200 years ago, but America still has a very long way to go for equality.
If they looked like they had an Americanized look/style like wearing chill clothes were American and the more dressy and well presented were foreign.
That is an example of pointing out the differences between people.
I agree that we pay less attention to what race everyone is, but I would be lying if I said there was no judgement or anything on different races.
In particular, I found the development of different accents to be comparable to the childhood game whisper down the lane.
I too, barely speak about race as it is not viewed as politically correct or proper to talk about.
The last time I checked basketball is a sport that mainly consists of dribbling and shooting a basketball.
I honestly do not know if we will ever see the end of racism, but if we do not try and change the way in which we approach racism, will we ever come close to an end?
However, as we move forward this way of thinking seems to be less and less supported by people.
I too never realized or questioned why there was a white man in the front of the evolution pack.
Also it's so crazy to learn that big noses are actually better than the smaller ones in terms of what they do for you.
The one quote that stood out to me from this short clip was something Sam said.
The atmosphere in class is so light and casual that it brings a refreshing aspect to the topics we discuss.
I think skin color is something we talk about frequently in the United States.
I am shamed to admit that there probably have been times where I looked at pictures of poor countries and thought to myself that the United States was superior.
It was very surprising to me that our noses are used to adapt to our respective environment.
I dont think that those 4 options of , basically is evolution real or is Christ real, are not the only options.
The question isn't who's on the field but who's in the owners box.
I also really agreed Sams comment about how Americans should travel the world to see what is out there.
It's all luck, I could have just as easily been born in a different country, but I wasn't.
That being said, inner city kids are usually people of color which is why they are good at sports such as soccer and basketball.
Every human civilization dating back tens of thousands of years have some sort of beliefs, and I think there is a lot of power behind thathistory.
It is not a bad thing to have biases, but we have to be able to recognize our biases and ask ourselves why we think the way that we do.
There really isn't a reason to be uncomfortable, but we feel uncomfortable because we're afraid of offending people.
Black people be chilling.
As an extremely pale white female Ive always considered the pigment of my skin to be a curse.
I grew up in a majority white community, and I have never really been in a position where I was considered a minority.
I enjoyed reading this post.
I also really like the social media option and think in such a big class it's really beneficial.
I totally agree with you about assuming right away when you see an Asian.
But what is even more crazy is the fact I was so dumb and ignorant just to kind of say they all look pretty alike.
leading to a big generalization that not all people agree with.
In Italy, generally the more south you go, the darker skin tone there is.
I would agree with this being a factor in the past, but nowadays states like Florida have their own teams.
Race and the idea those of European descent were superior allowed them to reconcile with destroying cultures, beating people, murdering people, raping people, ripping families apart and treating marginalized groups like animals.
It showed me how many people cannot tell the difference between Asians, Koreans and Chinese for example and many other races.
It just a matter of who decides to question and act upon the beliefs of other people.
In all of these instances the comments are slight but they all deal with race.
Until this day I had never thought about the idea that the picture was portraying the message of white people are most evolved.
Or,I wonder, would those gifted in the sport of football still play football?
A lot of white people fail to see or choose not to acknowledge their privilege.
What was even more interesting though, was their reasoning for their decisions.
I do not think that race is talked about too much.
Because of this, there might not be large racial groups that feel oppressed by another.
His frankness about how ignorant we are over the whole USA best country idea is very refreshing as well.
The world is a diverse place, and if people are aware about this, there will be more peace in our society.
But what comes to my mind is that with more and more people of mixed race, I feel that just by looking at a person's body appearance can not accurately determine their origin and race.
I grew up in a town with VERY little diversity but was still raised by parents that never spoke of race, let alone in a negative way.
Truthfully speaking it is hard for anyone to say that and have genuine reason behind their words.
But I do have a response for your thoughts about racial tensions getting better.
Because thats what Dr. Richards is saying right?
This is exactly what I talked about in my video response but mine was based on the Chinese vs. Korean challenge.
When I first came to Penn State, a college with plenty of diversity, I made quite a few friends that were of a different race.
Talking about openly is very knowledgeable and personally I learned a lot of things since day to day, people do not have those types of conversations.
Generally speaking, men (white males in particular), tend to be prideful and less willing to date a woman of color, which is why the most common combination we see today is a black male with a white female.
This issue was a very sensitive and critical topic this past year, and it still remains a problem at large because the Korean people want to receive an apology from the Japanese government of what Japanese soldiers did during Japanese occupation in Korea.
However, I feel that it is important to talk more about it because people need to understand what is going on in our country and be educated on what is really happening.
Like Sam mentioned, it's important to get real exposure to these places in order to fully experience a new location.
I absolutely agree with your last line about a black person choosing the fairest person not being an issue.
By doing this I believe that we can discuss race in a way that will not cause problems and continue the movement to fix race problems in the United States.
Even with this somewhat knowledge I had it was still like I was completely guessing.
I would say most of our generation is mixed races so when we have kids almost all of them will be mixed races.
For example, in the video, he explains that the longer noses are used for heating up the cold air we breathe in to our lungs during the winter time, and how our noses change over time to adapt to our environment.
For many, a persons race and ethnicity is the very first aspect of information that is received.
Respectively, I am not sure I can say I agree with this point made.
I went to a public school, and we were decent at lacrosse, but all the private schools in my area had really good lacrosse programs.
Met boyfriend is half Columbian which most people, including myself, do not realize based off of physical appearances alone.
After this class, I started to think about why I've never seen this image with anyone other than a white male.
My dads family moved to the United States when he was eleven.
During our first two weeks of class, many of the things that Sam had said stuck with me for longer than the duration of our lectures.
I see it when white girls try to compliment white girls.
I think this is a really interesting topic to discuss.
I feel like the choices that Sam gave last semesters class were way to broad.
Either way, I feel like race is a sensitive subject but we should address it and put it in the past.
It is rude and you are ruining it.
We're supposed to just accept that racism occurred and not speak about it?
There is a recent white supremacy out speaking when in reality we are all equal and all the same.
However this will not be a problem to the society if people can truly open their mind and appreciate the difference between people from every part of the world.
I would not automatically think to look at the nose or even someones eyes.
However, this activity specifically should how hard it can be to correctly distinguish a person ethnicity.
It was interesting to see what backgrounds these people were from because as I said before I would not have guessed their backgrounds and I would have been wrong.
I have noticed this throughout my life because as a child, I have lived in the United States, Italy and Portugal but have managed to always have at least one friend from the Philippines.
Perhaps on the larger scale we can pin race troubles on the lack of dealing with the genocide of the Native Americans, but on an individual level that is not the first thing nor is it even a thought when I think of the problems of race.
I can relate to your point about having issues trying to speak about race where you come from, because I too struggle with that as well.
While many people arent fortunate enough to go abroad and see what the world has to offer, it is definitely easy for people to learn about the world.
There's no need to bring race into these types of interactions and doing so can take away from the interaction and create unnecessary tension.
Also, culturally I think parents of different races push for different sports based on what is big in their home countries.
I think its because humans in general have very high egos.
It wasnt until the invention of ships that people were able to travel across the world.
On the flip side, I do agree that people can be overly sensitive about race.
I still have yet to ask my new college friends about their ethnicity, let alone their other characteristics such as their beliefs and values.
I have never truly traveled to anywhere in the world outside of America.
Just as Colten said that he was intrigued and interested in what she had to say during class I also wanted to add on that you can physically not be attracted to a certain race sexually and that does not make you a racist.
It could just have easily been you that was born in less than stellar conditions.
I believe false preconceptions are a disease that need to be killed at the root and it is a sole cause of race issues in America.
I bet you've heard that said to a black girl once or twice.
It showed that it is not just Americans who cannot tell the difference but the Asians had trouble telling them apart as well.
There is still a great deal of progress to be made, but I just hope one day the world will be at peace and there will be equality all around.
My skin color is black because it helped me survive the heat in the Caribbean and nothing more.
The government that leads this country has traces of racism and allows racism to be a continuous societal flaw, enabling it in certain situations.
The conversation has to change in order for us to accept our differences.
One example that always comes to my mind is teeth.
She was open to all races and was not prejudice.
I find interesting what you say about the previous generations.
Ive had my own stereotypes crushed and ended up hating cities I thought Id love.
As a society, we should crave to understand race and how it plays a role in our lives.
On one hand, like Sam was saying, its like all that we talk about in America is race.
We all have different backgrounds but just because someone is mixed does not mean that these race issues eventually disappear.
Its honestly disappointing that society has tried to manipulate people into believing that a white male is the most evolved species.
I believe culture, geographic location and economic status all play a huge part in what sports people play.
Im also mixed and I have also always felt like I had the best of both worlds.
If we want to uncover mysteries, chances are there are other people wondering the same thing.
Modern day, it is more common to see an interracial couple walking down the street.
Video: Evolution of Skin PigmentationFor a long time in American history the average person believed the color of your skin defined who you were in every other way.
I have to admit, I felt just as uncomfortable as you that day during class when Sam made your friend Melanie pick out the darkest person in our lecture.
I remember race being discussed the most when former President Obama was elected for his first presidential race.
Sam has mentioned that he has traveled to over 50 countries, yet he still feels like he doesn't understand the world.
If youve never been to the West Coast but judge your opinions based off pictures and movies you see you will never truly understand unless you visit for yourself.
However, I believe that they would harder chance of succeeding at certain sports.
I believe that we talk about race enough.
Now to think that I have inherited my skin color based on my ancestors and where they came from has given me an entirely different perspective.
Kristine, I think it is interesting to hear your opinion about Sam using your race in the lecture.
Because of this it makes sense that some sports could be divided on the basis of economics alone.
Overall though I do agree with the largest component of this response, people should be judged by who they are as a person, not because of their race.
I like this class and how it opens my mind and made me think about my ancestors in a way I never have before.
I completely agree that there are people who are racist without even realizing they could come from the same ancestral genetics.
No matter what, race will always be spoke about because it is a big issue today, especially with all the police brutality that has been going around.
I agree with your take on the subject and you made observations.
Instead, we should be grateful that someone cares to understand the issues of a country that isn't theirs.
I tend to agree with you that religion seems to be a main factor in changing people's mindsets to believe that we are more different than we actually are.
Meredith, this was probably the most interesting class so far in my opinion, and I definitely agree with this comment.
That thing you drink out of is not called a water fountain, but a bubbler.
In the 1800s, the United States put up with the issue of slavery, which was very wrong looking back at it.
We also grow up hating confrontation, now that doesn't mean arguing but that does mean we hate losing arguments themselves.
So Id first like to compare my childhood to yours.
If i had to pick out the darkest person, I would feel really uncomfortable even though it's something that you shouldn't be uncomfortable with.
I don't actually think there is racism but instead it is more of a cultural thing.
This collective agreement can be heard in the response to Charlottesville as the President seemed to be one of the only Americans who had difficulty reconciling the situation and condemning white nationalists.
I especially think from America's past people are sensitive to the topic and when people talk about race they are cautious.
You soon may find yourself in situations you would never previously imagine.
Although people are constantly talking about race, deep and informed conversations are rarely taking place.
Race is a big deal in the United States because racism runs rampant in the roots of our society.
Studying the image of evolution subconsciously white people grew up with the idea that they are the most evolved than any other race.
In this video Sam expresses how this class is one of a kind and shows a realistic portrayal of how we can talk about these topics.
If you look back on history, these differences have caused war, hatred, and seclusion, all at the cost of human lives.
Study after study proves people of color are treated differently usually poorly because of their race.
It makes everything seem a lot less political and instead gives off the impression that, things just are the way they are.
They are definitely not always an even mix, but nonetheless there is nothing stopping someone from playing a sport they enjoy.
We would still have a decent amount of discussions on race, but I never knew there were race problems in so many other countries either.
Our problem seems to be much more difficult to fix in that we do not speak bout race in the right ways too often, or even most of the time.
I had no idea there was a whole ideology and specific belief associated with them.
I believe biologically many of us go after and want to date what is similar to us.
One thing that really stuck out was people staying in their own regions and never really leaving.
Assuming they are descended from the slave trade, their ancestors are from West Africa, probably from hunter-gatherer tribes where their primary food source was chasing down and killing large game animals.
Why does a native Asian look a lot like a native American ?
I grew up in a football household so the culture I was raised in was very football oriented.
I wonder if thats ever really possible?
Your point about the weather was very interesting and I did not think of that before.
Personally, I think race does play a small roll in all athletes.
All humans have 99.9% of same genes and the idea that the white person is more evolved is a great example of white culture.
In this specific case, with that dude Hayden, who I personally find to be pretty damn entertaining, there was something that was said that didnt necessarily go over well with the majority of people.
However, refusing to address these issues only adds to the issue.
I think we are just afraid to address things because of the stigma surrounding race and the fact that even if we are not trying to be incorrect or accidentally say something that we do not know about people will instantly crucify you and label you a racist, which does nothing to progress racial relationships in the country only to shame others into silence.
The problem is not talking about race.
It sounds dumb to me thinking about it now, but it makes so much sense.
Yes I agree with you that many of these athletes train their whole lives to get to their skill level, but I also think many of them are naturally gifted.
Therefore, I do think we talk about race a lot and we should keep discussing it.
In this response, I am mainly talking about how I feel as a white female seeing other white people not dating outside their color-line, but I know that a lot of people of every skin tone are pressured to not date outside their color-line as well.
I have only ever thought about peoples backgrounds based on appearance in a very basic and stereotypical way.
As mentioned in class, there are arguments to both sides on whether we discuss race not enough or too much.
When his super dark Italian grandfather discovered his grandsons future roommate was going to be black, he caused a huge commotion and demanded the school to change his living situation.
I feel like being white, it almost feels offensive to say that I believe race is talked about it too much.
My favorite part of church (not like it had much competition) was asking my dad questions that I felt like were in the grey areas of the bible.
Sam takes this idea to the extreme when he talked about radicalizing the bible.
The fact that all the possible questions cannot be answered by one book is why people have to interpret the answers.
This is where disagreements begin because everyone is going to read the bible differently.
The same is true when discussing the Quran in the Middle East but, in general, we as a society do not see it like that.
I feel like the United States made it seem like it was for different reasons when it actually wasnt.
I find it very upsetting how little we think about the soldiers, the civilians, and the war.
War is a terrible thing and people need to stop and think about the real men, women, and children who live their life in it.
Because the fish is in it, it lives it's who life in it so it doesn't really feel it (excuse me if I didn't get the quote completely right) but this really opened my eyes because it is an amazing comparison and so true.
In the Old Testament, there are over 100 laws that is written.
This makes me very sympathetic because while I am proud to be American, its not fair for innocent families to be traumatized.
When I was in elementary school, my mother told me about the war outrage while President Bush was in office, and she explained to me that soldiers who fought for our country died in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Hey Kazel, I had the same thoughts about Afghanistan when Sam asked that question.
That is the kind of person to consider a role model.
Yes, it is just one man and for every Mr. Razzo there is a man who now spites the US after the same situation.
Race is still very much an issue in society, and I definitely agree we do not talk about this enough.
This last question relates to what Sam was talking about in the video.
It's no surprise to anyone that the current U.S. government is implementing policy that leans onto the right-winged, christian, conservative side.
For instance, he has been open about the fact that he does not support abortion, simply because it goes against his Christian beliefs.
Although the verse DOES say this, it also says that a large amount of other people are not allowed into heaven either.
Instead even if one is religious, they should be educated from society to formulate their own opinions on topics such as same sex marriage.
However, he then showed that a slew of people, not just homosexuals, were also included in that list in the very same sentence in that all the people mentioned would not get into heaven.
It appears as if the teachers are taking messages from the Quran and interpreting them in a way that is harming these children.
Is it fair to say that the majority of conflicts are based on religious differences?
It seems as if humans chose to deny the fact that other religions exist.
I find it difficult to rationalize that religion often drives wars, and these wars are expressions of hate.
I think I have this disconnect because I have never experienced war on our home soil.
I think it is simply a matter of where the location puts emphasis.
So, there cannot be much room for some advanced genetics to dominate one high school over another local high school of the same size.
That means more people are enthused about football and therefore more high schoolers go out for football.
A program starts to blossom and bring in more talented players.
I really think that the media in the U.S. dehumanized Afghans in a way that made their lives worth less than our own.
Although I have been aware of radical or extreme religious groups in both religions, the Christian groups were never on my radar much whether that be from the media or my family or American culture.
Talking about these ideas has been very thought-provoking to me, as I did not realize how similar is in comparison.
Therefore, I think open discussion is so important in helping us become more engaged with the world around us.
If people were to learn more about other cultures and countries in an unbiased way, more people might choose to help people in these places or at least make sure they continue to be informed.
I had never known what the word sharia meant until this class.
It is hard to do especially, when most peoples values stem back to their religion.
I understand that their religion and beliefs shape their feelings towards certain things in our government but to try to enforce those same ideals on us is wrong.
If seeing how horribly forcing religion upon government laws in countries like Iraq has taught us anything, its that it just shouldnt be done.
We cant expect all the worlds problems to be found in a book that cant possibly address modern issues.
Ive heard the term Sharia Law very vaguely before and never knew what it was.
This class in particular really opened my eyes that Islam and Christianity really arent that different and that there are extreme sides to both.
Ive had many bibles over the course of my life but Ive never gotten past the book of Genesis because the Old Testament bored me.
Im not going to go into it but I feel like today the separation of church and state is nonexistent.
I believe its because of religion, and how the bible is against homosexuals but it contradicts itself in saying Love thy neighbor as thyself.
I've never thought about it that way.
The next part that stood out to me was when sam compared ISIS to the Christian Sharia law.
Its just crazy to think Christian Sharia is an idea and that so many people follow it and just thinking what if it can get out of hand like ISIS is outrageous.
Sam also talked about how he gave a speech that gained some popularity in the middle east.
One man named Basim reached out to sam saying that sam was spot on in what he said during his talk.
We had a chance to talk to basic and some of the things he said were very touching.
The last thing that spoke to me in class was Basims last message.
Others also claim that Islamic terrorists could try to set up Sharia Law in the US.
Another huge point he noted was that many different groups can interpret the Bible and Quran differently.
However, as Sam points out, the Bible forbids many other common things and condemns them equally.
I think that people should open their eyes when it comes to religion.
While I don't necessarily agree that war in general is for economic gain, I will say that the war in Iraq was heavily economically influenced.
When Sam was talking about sodomites in that same bible verse mentioned above, I thought that this was a good point to make especially because of the target population.
We try to ignore a lot that we see in order to make ourselves seem better and are people who can stay true to their values.We seem to overlook things we deem as not important to us and put more pressure on the things we can't relate to because its easier for us to judge other than judge ourselves.
Even for individuals who follow a religion different than Christianity, it can be frustrating having to follow rules that simply don't apply to you or that you don't agree with.
Unfortunately, for many of us the media is the only exposure we get to Islam and we often forget that the media is owned by individuals who have a vested interest in our opinion of people they might want to manipulate.
So many groups around the world use religion as an excuse to do terrible things.
When it comes to American government, you have to keep church and state separate.
Considering most of the nation is primarily christian it seems reasonable.
But you still have to keep it separate from government.
When we really look into the topic a lot of questions does come up.
I personally don't think race plays any role into what sports kids play.
There are people in this country just trying to enjoy their lives with their families, but this is disrupted by so much.
It is so sad that this is normal for these young girls.
But in the video, LTC Garey explains that they are people just like us.
The class where we talked about the Afghan people was such a powerful class for me personally.
This class discussion helped to really humanize the Afghan people and show everyone that in many ways they are just like us and there is no reason to hate them.
It's all about history, but looking forward is the way to change.
Yet I have never dated someone outside my race.
There are many reasons that I could think of, that may help explain why this phenomenon occurs.
We view the Willard Preacher as some crazy man who preaches how we're all going to hell.
Laws can discreetly promote Christianity and may push certain view points, like how being gay is immoral rather than teaching that Jesus loves all people.
While there is a risk that laws may be based of a single religion, I believe that this country can not become as violent when talking about forcing a certain view point on to others.
When Sam brought in Lt. Garey for class, I was very intrigued, and it quickly became my favorite class of this semester thus far.
Lt. Garey also gave us a look into why it is easier for soldiers to sympathize with fellow soldiers instead of civilians like us back at home.
I found myself guilty of these false judgements as well and I think the main component to all of this is the fact that we choose to not educate ourselves better, therefore, continuing to stay at a state of ignorance.
Its important to stay empathetic to the entire world, regardless, because we would hope that such tragedies would never happen to anyone.
For instance, my uncles two sons have both been on tour in both Iraq and Afghanistan.
War is a horrible thing, but Im glad Sam was able to bring people in to put the harsh reality into perspective.
The war is disaster for them but the media over the world has lead the public around the world to feel fear of them.
I think this is something that we can learn from.
But the fact that his perception was changed from a negative to a positive through some shared experiences is a good and touching thing.
There were no nuclear weapons, automatic weapons, cell phones or electronics back when these texts were written so anything to do with modern problems won't be solved by any religious literature.
I do not know many people who have actually read the religious texts of the religion that they practice.
They think with the mentality of, If the pastor or imam or any religious leader interprets it in the right manner why should I read it.
Building a relationship with your god takes time, and it is ultimately a personal journey.
I even almost raised my hand in class as one of the only people going to Heaven but then realized I misinterpreted the texts.
Not reading your religious texts or only listening to your religious leaders preaching does not make you a bad person or a bad Christian or Muslim or whichever religion you practice.
As someone who used to be a regular church attendant, I can say that the whole story of the bible is not being told in church.
In my belief, the church should not be scorning any group of people just because they have sinned because one message that is a central theme of the bible is to love your neighbor.
I guess one could callit a defense mechanism, but mostof the time, I use it as a tool to connect with the people I'm addressing.
Basically, something you can't laugh at is scary- it has a solemnity about it that weighs down your mind.
It was a humanizing moment; I felt connected to my classmateswhen Sam sentsuper personal questions into the space of the room.
Maybe that could be the reason that now as an adult I have strayed away from the church and my old beliefs.
Being associated with that kind of image is nothing I want for myself even in the slightest.
The example of the texting and forms of communication was a great great example on relating it something we can sort of connect to as millennials.
I talked about how we choose the things we want to read in order to make yourself feel better which is just a tactic to not face what we have done.
We are pushing these things out of our minds because the system was not able to be adjusted.
It adjusts our mindset of what it means to be religions.
Too often we just imagine Afghanistan and Iraq as deserted war zones where everyone is a terrorist because the is the belief the media reinforces in our minds.
I will be enlisting in the Army as soon as I graduate.
I also enjoyed this lecture realizing that war is a real thing.
It wasnt until this class that it too opened up my eyes to realize this thing is real.
Or coming home one day and see your family home in nothing but rubble.
I also think media is part of the problem because they hide the truth behind wars.
When coming to Sharia, I both disagree and agree to the use of Quran as the law of a country.
I disagree because it is sometimes.
But if you look at countries which enforces strict sharia law , the number of rape cases are in single digits almost as close to 2 or 3.
While such good laws are in place, there are also bad to these laws.
Since these laws were made centuries back its not applicable to scenarios in the 21st century.
Also restricting the use of entertainment seems like a vague idea for me.
I think what Professor Richards wanted to do by using this term, was to compare the negative connotation given to peoples of Islam, to the groups of Christian people who practice outdated principles and demonstrate hate towards other religions and people.
There is no one interpretation for every circumstance in our lives, and so, extremist groups try to promote their own selfish agenda, using their bizarre interpretations of sacred text as justification for doing so.
And why I love this soc119 class so much is because Professor Richards is doing just what I have said.
It was extremely interesting to hear a military man that has spent tours in Afghanistan.
I never look at my family or my two year old little brothers that are still so innocent and full of joy and think there are kids just this pure and sweet that are stuck in this conflict.
I didn't even realize the biases I had created in my mind.
I need to be more thoughtful.
I don't blame anyone but myself but I often imagine why it is that these are the only images we tend to see on cable news.
I also thought that the entire country was a war zone, which was completely not true.
However, Sam opened the doors for the class to see the actual Middle East.
People need to be more open to cultures that they truly do not know everything about.
He thinks that if he and his family stops doing this work, who will do it?
Even if it means living with the constant threat of getting killed.
And there is nothing more important than standing for what you believe in.
It is because of men like him, people get to lead a normal life.
We are so quick to collectively judge groups of people as a whole and I believe this is our biggest problem in this country.
Maybe this is just because I am in the majority of this country and believe in God and believe in the bible so I does not even hit me when God is mentioned.
I find it interesting how Sam sort of, to me, displayed Muslims as the stereotypical terrorist-looking people that spread fear and hate.
It always seemed like this was a class to learn the truth about our cultural differences and try to see things from all sides.
What scares me is that this lecture seemed to have the goal to put fear in us that this is what could be coming to America in Christian form.
I also do not see real Christians using violence and terroristic tactics to make that happen.
Maybe it was just me, but this seemed like the most far-fetched lecture of the semester and I really hope that this class does not continue to become more extremist like this.
The news and social media outlets should provide authenticity and should not be making generalizations based on someones religious beliefs.
I also went through the same realization as you did when Rafi and LTC Garey spoke about the people and the culture in Afghanistan.
Some of these actions may be harmful to other people, or even to be considered deviance behavior.
The ideas of the protesters may be correct under certain explanations of the bible, however what these people are wishing for are something extreme and unfortunate.
It may be possible that their interpretation of the bible is true, but they may be misleading and avoiding certain contents in the bible to achieve their goals.
Each religion has its own bible, but people may have different opinions on what their god is trying to tell them.
As long as the actions that people do are kind and obeying the laws, I do not think that there is any difference between them.
The other day in class, after learning Basims story, I went home and thought about it the rest of the day.
When the rest of the excerpt was shown, even I, as a Christian was not fully aware of all the other reasons one can be excluded from heaven.
Furthermore, it is so important that people do not make generalizations about religions based on the small percentage of people that are violent and quoting the bible of the Quran as their reason for violence, especially because most religions promote peace.
I think American as a whole do not sympathize for any country that we have occupied in the past 20 years.
I can't imagine what it is like being Rafi.
Because of this, I feel like it is easy to make assumptions about another culture if one doesnt know.
Coupled with the negatively charged way people talk about Sharia law makes people not fully understand the full concept of the religion.
They are all a set of stories that give rules on ways to live your life.
How can one base every life decision on the laws of a book written years and years ago?
Personally, I've never read the Bible or the Kran but I'm certain it teaches good and positive ways of living.
Islam is not the only theory that gets described differently than what it actually is.
So it is important to do our own research before we can judge things that are talked about in the media, because what they say could always just be one-sided or not well researched.
This goes for soldiers on both sides, and realizing so many lives are being taken as a way of technically resolving a political or non political issue is heartbreaking.
Every person has their own life and their own story and their dreams and passions are alike.
In the end, if we keep fighting against one another we will never come together as one world and embrace our humanity.
I think there is some validity to your point though.
When I learned what we went to war in the middle east, bombing civilians, I was in disbelief.
They dress the same, they shop in the same malls as we do, they live in houses similar to ours, although I thought the mall and houses that Sam showed us were significantly better than the ones in the town I've grown up in.
If the news shows us the full story, then only can we better understand the situation there, and then maybe we could treat other Muslims fleeing from their war torn country with more respect.
I have lived my life in the belief the Jesus is lord, and he is the son of God who created everything in existence.
To me that never made sense, however, I learned it wasn't the faith that was wrong but the way the people who were behind religions were corrupting the people.
They were able to control and corrupt people by assuring them that no matter what crime, or sin they commit even if it is pillaging a village with women and children for example the crusades.
They concern themselves with these hours long prayers and what not yet always ask for a donation from its followers.
However, I don't just limit myself to the teachings of the holy bible.
The one difference that I have come across though that not a whole lot of people have payed attention to.
I am perplexed at the fact that we are so similar, yet our religious beliefs can drive us so far apart.
I also think that religion is a very interesting topic, and it can be interpreted in numerous ways!
I found it sad and unfortunate that the civilians are the ones who get the most harm.
When I hear the word Afghanistan I automatically think of war.
The war there has been going on my whole life.
However, I never really thought about how its still a real place with real people.
However, it is rare to hear the opinion of an actual citizen.
I definitely agree that so many Americans have this stereotype of aggression against the Afghan people.
The way he taught the class and was able to grab our attention by using comedic comparisons and helping us relate it to aspects of life that we as college students face on a weekly basis.
Almost every individual who reads a book such as the Bible or the Quran will have a different perspective then the next person who reads it and the person before them.
They act out in certain ways because that is what they believe it to true.
There is a large variety of religions that exist throughout the world.
Through all the traveling that Sam has done, he has been able to experience and feel for these people.
In the story he explains that he was called into a meeting with Afghani allies who claim to have captured the commander.
Was he granted some sort of immunity?
And also I was wondering if LTC Garys tone and behavior towards the commander changed after he found out his true identity?
He would often change the subjectwhen Sam discussed it.
What this lecture opened my mind to is how closely related Christianity and Islam really are.
I think religion is one of those things where you cannot find a perfect fit anymore.
Its kind of like the constitution where it can be interpreted over time.
Just like quartering slaves sounds ridiculous to us now, I do hope that there is a day where being a homosexual is sinning can also be seen as past our time.
Whether you agree with everyones interpretations does not matter, but having a dialogue to help understand it key.
On the surface, it seems like a ludicrous statement given the decade of media Americans have been exposed to regarding the country.
However, thats obviously not an accurate depiction of what life is really like for Afghanis.
The reason behind why we have an Establishment Clause makes total sense and is consistent with the idea of the separation of church and state.
But how come it never seems to be enforced?
While I consider myself a spiritual person, believing in some sort of higher power, I dont affiliate with any religion.
Sometimes there are things going on, terrible things, and almost no one hears about them.
I have my own beliefs as an individual but my core values and beliefs fall in line with those of the bible.
This is actually something I have struggled to understand my whole life.
I definitely agree with your statement that people are prone to considering their personal interpretation the correct view of their religion.
To an extremist, they must feel as though their extreme or violent actions are the only way to achieve salvation or follow the true teachings of their faith.
In the fight against radical extremists, I think we should be doing more to understand the mentality of these people and educate them on the central truths that their religion teaches.
They put their lives on the line to fight for our country, which is something so brave and takes a certain kind of person to do.
These are real people who are trying to live real lives.
If this was happening in our country, it would become so much more real.
It is easy to disassociate from the wars in foreign places because we do not know how much this war is effecting real people.
In class, a face was put to the disasters and the war problems and it made the war seem so much more real.
The video clip that I have selected to respond to is the clip in which Sam discusses Christian Sharia.
During this lecture, I remember thinking to myself how different it is to hear Sam say Christian Sharia because this is not a term that I have ever heard before.
Whenever I have heard the term Sharia I have heard it with a very negative connotation.
I found it very eye opening that Sam talked about a Christian Sharia because usually Sharia is only thought about with the Muslim religion.
However, that is not to say that I am ignorant to the faults and shortcomings of many perceived ideologies of the catholic faith.
The bible is the written word of God, our creator, through which I find comfort in trusting to guide me through my life.
One of my favorite lessons in religion class was what is known as Paschals wager.
To have your whole life uprooted in the blink of an eye and to live each day not knowing if you'll see the next is a fear that no person should ever have to experience.
My grandmother is also from Ireland so I understand how different the relationship between church and state can be in other countries.
There was a strong Jewish community that attended my Middle School and I would've found it odd had they been controlled by a christian ruled government.
I think it creates an impression on the American people that violent acts are only committed by Muslims which clearly isn't true.
I also never realized how horrendous war actually was.
In regards to Colonel coming in and talking about how he had barely fired his weapon throughout his five different tours, and you being surprised to him saying that, I was also surprised.
He asks them their opinion on why things are the way that they are and the black students never seem to have a good enough reason.
This really made me think about the world Ive been brought up in.
By doing this they allow someone to be trapped in a relationship that they are unhappy in and that simply doesnt seem fair.
But the only thing is that it is war torn.
The news that we see every day always leaves out key information in the stories that they cover.
I do feel unaware of what is happening in the world when I only watch the news on tv.
In this video it talks about the perceptions people have on military men and women.
I personally found this video interesting because my ex boyfriend of two years is in the military and I have multiple close friends who are in the military and have been deployed.
While he says that this perception isnt true, I tend to think otherwise.
Also in the video he mentioned how new soldiers have perceptions about how their time is going to be in the military and it is completely different than what they are thinking.
I can definitely relate to a lot of what you said!
But I do not believe in the same God that the hateful people we see in the media believe in.
I also agree that more people need to recognize the similarities between religions.
I am very confident in my religious beliefs, and I do believe that my God watches over everyone, but I would never place more value on my values over another persons.
I began questioning a lot of the hypocrisies & translations that exist within the bible.
I still believed parts of it but felt that a lot of the ideologies contradicted themselves.
I was bored and irritated by all of the metaphorical messages I received.
Also, I was turned off by the myopia displayed by many christians when it comes to those commonly disputed issues.
Okay, if were going to state what we should & shouldn't do because the bible says, then you also shouldn't sleep with anyone beside your partner, you should have no false gods, (that means no nNetflix binge watching.
The bible also says to love everyone.
When does dehumanizing someone by removing or ridiculing their right to be in a relationship look like showing them love?
If youre going to drive that reasoning, then you need to follow it with EVERYTHING you do.
A huge point that is forgotten is the Establishment Clause, i.e.
I believe in a higher force, but I can't say that I live by the bible.
I admire those who have so much faith in this book though.
However as he continues to describe all of the ways that woman can also get out of a marriage, I realized that it actually is not much different than what it is for catholics.
There are people that take good from these teachings, and people that take drastically different ideas from them.
Religions are all really similar for the most part, however, and that is something should be noticed as a guiding way of life for people.
I loved his comparisons between the Bible and the Quran, because it showed me that there were a lot more similarities than differences.
I have always interpreted the Bible as The Good News, so it was so eye-opening to me to think that white supremacists and other hate groups justify their actions with Christianity.
Most Christians want peace, and to spread the good word of God, but there is a select group that lives their lives with hate for others.
I was so surprised when we were able to skype with him in class too.
I couldn't believe that Professor Richards gave us the opportunityto really hear his pain and suffering.
Essentially sharia law is a group of bullies or gangsters saying that they feel the laws should be this way because that is what god and their holy book has told them.
The experience of having a real life conversation who suffered through war and lost his family because of it was like an eye opener, it was just so heartbreaking to see how at one moment everything was just fine, and the next moment, it's all gone.
They are normal people just like this, living anormal life along with a family.
He lost everything he had.
Yes, it is so cruel but these are certain things that we can't do much about and it's sad.
I really enjoyed hearing about this in class because it offered a perspective differing from the stereotypes associated with Afghanistan.
All things considered, I think it is important for people to truly understand Afghan culture because if they dont, the stereotypes of it being a war-ridden country will still exist.
It is weird to think that each of us have benefits that are fitted just to us.
No human being can actually truly represent their faith from its true meaning as every single human interprets their religion differently.
However, the way they are reading is different.
The extremists interpret what they read as just the holy word of God.
They cite one out of context verse and base their actions on that specific verse.
As the student points out in the beginning, every person always finds a way to argue that they are better.
Everyone wants to have great success and be able to look in the mirror and pat themselves on the back for all the hard work and effort it took to get there, but whenever we screw up or something doesnt go as planned, we immediately resort to pointing fingers and blame.
It does not make it easier for any person involved.
I think there's definitely a double standard we as Americans often don't even notice.
Those pictures and video clips shown on the media are sometimes misleading and making generalizations that can cause us people to reinforce stereotypes of the country and people of Afghanistan.
I remember thinking to myself why are we still over there why can we not just drop a bomb where all of the militants are and be done with the war.
However, they get caught in the crossfire.
They to go shopping, have sports; live the everyday normal lives that we do in America its not just a bunch of people running around trying to kill American soldiers.
There is no defined enemy because we cannot tell the opponent apart from the people who live there.
That is where I think we are wrong.
This country is so competitive in every aspect of life that people now feel like they can not have their own piece of mind.
Its a completely different story to live in a community full of terrorism and war.
It's actually quite interesting how all these different religions throughout the world have very similar beliefs.
They are taught otherwise.
Hate is something that is taught, not something we are born with.
With that it is completely clear that we are using recent events and that have happened to the american people in the past 2 decades to condemn and hate an entire culture.
The reason is because we as humans were never meant to interpret the Bible because we will always get it wrong.
It was very smart because it was hard to argue against anything Sam said since if you do you'll automatically be considered racist since there is not much you can argue against what was said.
A common complaint I have heard from people is that if a muslim does something to cause terror it is terrorism, but when a white person does the same, it will be reported as someone having mental issues or being a good person overall.
For example, Islam has gained a bad name because of some radical groups that carry out terrorist attacks in the name of Islam.
Another thing that Sam talked about during this class period was the idea of religious freedom bills.
Afghani law punishes discrimination against others for all the reasons that say people are allowed to deny services through religious freedom bills.
When he starts touching upon family life, and the way he has to say bye to his family everyday as if he might not return, my heart shattered.
However, it is also unfair to expect adults to stop their lives or desire for a family (having children) due to the current circumstances.
I have to agree with that because I am a Catholic and I read the Bible.
Yes, I am Catholic but that does not mean that I agree with Bible when it comes to same sex marriage.
I too believe there is a higher power that I will never understand until death.
Which is why I think religion is such an easy way of thought to comprehend for people.
At some point in the lecture after talking about how the US completely bombed Mosul, he asked us how we felt.
It was only in their interest to completely ruin Venezuela because of the obvious: oil.
I understand where this man is coming from because just like they bombed his home for political reasons they attempted to instill a coup in my own country.
But in all honesty I do not feel any disgust towards this country because I live in it now.
I believe this lecture definitely opened people's eyes to something they have probably not even have heard of at all.
It wouldn't be in their interest to show all the ugly things our country has done because that would only increase hate towards one another which would cause an immense amount of tension.
Or would they have been as cruel as the original settlers who stole, tortured, and enslaved?
This is because racism is something that we are taught and force fed to us at very young age.
I completely agree with most everything that you said.
No one should have to face limitations for the lives they live because someone else cant accept other peoples beliefs.
It's crazy how people interpret the bible so differently and so radically.
I really enjoy where you said, The fact that all the possible questions cannot be answered by one book is why people have to interpret the answers, because it's so true.
In fact, they are some of the most peaceful people I know.
While he is correct in this point, the elephant in the room is the fact that the Global community and the Western World are primarily at war with radical Islamic terrorism.
The Quran and Sharia Law, although interpreted differently by different people of Islamic faith, terrifies me.
While most Muslims do not follow this absurd version of Sharia, Sharia still remains an evil and inhuman form of law and order around the world.
Even if your religious book here has a description of divorce, in our country you also have to go through legal divorce.
I also think that the four ways women can go about getting a divorce is interesting as well.
If a man can no longer provide for his wife she is allowed to divorce him.
I chose to write my discussion on what the Quron says about divorce.
Similar to child support in America, the man must support the woman after the divorce unless she agrees to not receive money from him.
One thing that is also similar to America is the divorce cannot happen unless the woman agrees.
It is extremely sad that radical Islamic believers bring so much negative attention to such a peaceful religion.
I am sad that I am not being taught about other cultures and religions until now in my college career because it truly is a conversation worth having.
In this segment, professor Richards compares the Bible to the Quran on how they play a role in dictating the way society functions.
I have never been formally introduced to Quran or its teaching, and why they are so important in the Muslim religion.
Many people assume that a large amount of Muslim societies base their laws and norms around the teaching in the Quran, and that is simply not the case.
It is important to note that the both Bible and Quran contain regulation guidelines for topics like divorce, sodomy, religion, etc.
There are small societies or groups of people that live their lives according to the guidelines, but almost every government has its own laws.
Being a Christian myself, it was very interesting and somewhat surprising to learn that the Quran and the Bible have many similarities.
I agree 100% with what you're saying about proactive conversation.
The way that I look at the New Testament is that it should be open for interpretation.
Since no one was there when it was written, it's impossiblefor anyone to know what the authors' intentions were.
I started having sex when I was a junior in high school.
If all these activities we do are going to keep us from heaven, why do we pick and choose which are okay to do?
This is where a lot of my doubt in religion comes from.
Since being in college, I have identified as agnostic.
Also some of the beliefs did not make sense to me.
I also believe that homosexuality is innate.
In your post, you reference the Native Americans and the smallpox epidemic that in your opinion limited the diversity of America as a whole.
I completely agree and support on your thoughts and comments about the Quran and Bible.
Majority of the people use these books as a guidelineof life and it is very true that misinterpretation comes i several levels and you can understand it by relating your real life experienceswith it.
I took African American Studies course and learned a lot about these historically racist laws that Sam brought to our attention, and I was incredibly shocked.
Mostif not all of the racial inequalities in America are because of systemic racism, and a lot of people are not given the same opportunities because of the implications of these racially-motivated laws.
We will not be able to make America a better place for our future and for People of Color unless we fix the broken system that exists today.
I agree with everything you said.
I love soc 119 but I feel as if sam has to dumb down the material to make people comprhend basic things which I've noticed to many of us that are international, from different countries and cultures, is common sense.
Honestly its a crazy concept for most people a lot of the stuff sam talks about because the average person knows so little about the world.
Even though racism has slightly gotten better over the years, it still exists.
And because racism is still alive it needs to be talked about.
We experience racism on a daily basis which makes it an easy discussion topic.
They also need to see the lack of equality racism puts on members of the minority.
War affects real people had to be one of the most interesting lectures we covered thus far.
Instead they have normal jobs like us and live an average life.
But after seeing the photos of their everyday life it did change my initial view of the country.
On a different note, I was glad that Sam briefly talked about how war was not just about physical fighting.
He stated that soldiers usually send most of their time negotiating and engaging with other soldiers.
It also really upset me that Bassim lost everything and the United States Government didn't even care.
Also, I was very upset that the United States Government barely even gave him enough money to pay for the funerals of the people that he lost.
It also makes me upset that we never discuss these things.
It also made me think about how privileged I am to have a home and my family still with me.
It was eye opening to hear him say that he viewed what he does as a responsibility.
Its inspirational to know that there are so many people like Rafi would put their life on the line every day hoping to change the world.
The hardcore christian values explained in the response above reminded me of some similarly ridiculous notions in my own religion of hinduism.
I am not a very religious person either, for reasons related to this.
I understand the benefits of religion, but corruption in the Catholic Church as well as people radicalizing religious texts has driven me to distance myself from my religion.
Its hard to imagine a world that has laws actually governed by religion, however I watched a show on HBO called The Handmaids Tale which gives a glimpse into an America run by radicalisms.
Although, I havent read the bible completely, there have definitely been some passages in it where I question what its saying.
Alyssa I agree with you when you say we live in a society where the country Afghanistan is generalized as a country of violence.
I cant imagine what him and the other people in that country go through in their everyday life.
I also agree that hearing it from Raffi a cultured man who's been there and knows what its like is very eye opening.
But knowing Raffi put his life on the line to do the work he does is scary.
They are ignoring the fact that their Bible also says that is wrong to hurt another person.
However religion should not be mixed up with law and governance.
However, I believe religious law gets a bad reputation.
I would argue that if those lawmakers lived in today's modern era, the laws that have been written would be different.
I believe that the religous books are given by God as a template for how society should work.
Society progresses and so does beliefs change of the human kind.
Because of this, Islam has gotten this image of being an aggressive, hateful, and violent religion.
It's a terrible truth of life that there are some people who will use God's word, which is supposed to teach love, peace, and forgiveness, to justify the exact opposite.
That is innocent people that are being killed because of the war and just because of where they live.
We are so privileged to live somewhere where we are not afraid of being bombed or attacked while we are in our homes.
I am grateful that Rafi could join our class and share his perspective because it opened my eyes and informed me so much on the lives of people in those kinds of places.
Personally I think Basim is such a strong person for going through all that and losing his family.
I cannot imagine losing my family or anyone that is close to me, thinking it is just a normal day night and saying goodnight to the people that you did not think you can lose in that way and have them be taken away from you the next day without any warning or time to properly say goodbye and still be able to forgive those that caused it and for that I applaud him.
It really got to me when he spoke about him leaving everything and how he has not been back to Mosul (I am not sure of the spelling) in years and how it is difficult for him to go back.
Either ways I understand why he would feel the difficulty of being able to go back.
I appreciate your post however I do have some things to comment on.
For one, the racial tensions have heightened in recent years, however, they have been there for years.
The KKK is a hateful group that has a history of severe racial violence against black Americans.
Though I am 100% in agreement that there are still instances of discrimination, this Left-Wing hate group claims to be against fascism yet they engage in actions that literally fit the dictionary definition of the fascism they claim to be fighting.
Furthermore, the tensions in Ferguson, Missouri to me are more a reflection of discriminations of the past than anything that happened to Michael Brown.
I am also yet to hear any leaders who helped stir the pot in Missouri acknowledge the falsehoods behind that particular situation.
Being schools designed for thought they do not establish the laws of the land in the minds of the next generation.
What we need as a global society is free and publicaccess to proven factual information without the endless distraction of advertising and corporate interests.
I feel like in the US, we tend to believe that our society is way too civilized to allow any religion to govern how we live and we overlook things like the fact the gay marriage wasnt legal throughout the country until recently or that in some states you can refuse to service someone because it conflicts with someones religious beliefs.
Like Sam said earlier this week the Quran and the Bible basically have the same type of stuff in them, and we keep sliding into this into these so-called religious freedom debates where its completely fine to completely devalue someone because it goes against someones religious belief.
I was raised Jewish but basically slept my way through Hebrew School and don't really associate myself with any religion.
However, in class I learned that there are similar parallels between the bible and the Quran.
Not to be offensive, but I don't believe in any religions and I don't think that a book should be able to justify someone's actions or tell someone how to live their life.
No one should be looking at a piece of text and base their life off of it.
Not only do people find comfort in their religions but they also value some of the same things like believing in Heaven and Hell, Satan, and similar commandments that are a set of rules given by God for people to obey.
Religion is a choice and if people chose to live by a text then by all means go for it!
This was the first time I have ever been to Europe.
If I were to study abroad for a full semester I would really get to know more about other cultures and gain a lot of lifetime memories.
But if everyone can just cherry pick or create their own interpretation, what is the value in adhering to a holy book at all?
Some of the 2016 presidential candidates for the Republican party stressed that they were Christians first above all else.
Yet many of our leaders who call themselves Christians are no different than most Americans who have also gone against the teachings of the Bible.
It is incredibly hypocritical when a politician argues for policy change on the basis of religion when that politician has more than likely done something that would go against what the Bible says.
It was truly impossible for me to figure out what makes a personNative American, Chinese, and most of all Asian European.
This all makes sense to me but I guess I just never knew how similar these people could look.
This shows me that these words actually have very little accuracy and significance.
There are issues with both of these things, because one allows us to forget that racial disparities exist and the other could allow us to focus too much on them, possibly dividing us even further.
Obviously, I dont have a solution to this but it would be great if we could find that perfect balance of using these terms for the advancement of race relations.
I am glad that we got the chance in class to hear Rafi talk about his life back in Afghanistan.
Especially like Rafi, since his partner died doing peaceful work, Rafi lives that constant fear as well.
They believe that every problem that occurs can be interpreted by the Holy books.
I found this class very interesting because I grew up my entire life attending Catholic school and never really had an idea about other religions.
This was honestly my favorite lecture of the year so far because it radically questioned peoples religion by turning their own beliefs against them.
It questioned people on why their understanding of other peoples religion without truly understanding it or following their own.
In the beginning of class, I remember thinking the attack on Sharia Law was crazy simply because it could never happen in the United States.
The Torah (although much more complex than just a simple book of stories that it looks from the outside) is basically a blueprint to understand how to live a good life.
Some people radicalize the ideas of the Quran, but people radicalize ideas from every religion!
Sam is completely right when he says that most people who critique and are against Sharia Law consider themselves Christians and that they dont realize the similarities that the Quran and the New Testament have to each other.
Another point is that if the Christians were to truly follow the Bible and their beliefs, most of them would be going to hell.
The Christian Bible has many strict, strict rules on how to live life and most people break those restrictions at a relatively young age and, according to Christianity, theyre doomed to rot in hell for the rest of eternity for it.
We have so many issues happening that a book cannot solve.
I loved your comments and agree that no one person has the power to say that their belief is right and yours is wrong.
I also found Sam's fish in the sea comparison very interesting.
People find motivation and purpose for life in many different ways, and sometimes it might be difficult for people to relate.
If you do not agree with another religion's customs it is important do not display this disagreement with hatred or violence, but rather make an effort to at try to look at it with a different view.
I come from a very generic suburb that is not diverse at all.
Coming to such a diverse environment such as Penn State and especially this Soc 119 class has opened my eyes to many of the issues that minorities and other religious groups face.
I agree with this due to the fact that I am Catholic and I believe that the Bible is so old and due to the advancements in society that it is interpreted differently.
And I also have to agree with Reilly when he talks about how Muslims and Christians are the biggest fighting group.
I feel like people fight so much due to the fact that they are so much alike that even when it comes to the small things in the Quran and the Bible they are going to fight about it.
There are many Christians in the world with a multitude of different ideas of how they interpret the Bible.
Others, however, are very aggressive when it comes to their faith and thus may act hostile towards people of different faiths.
Through righteous indignation, these people have convinced themselves that they are doing Gods work, and are thus morally justified in whatever they wish to do.
No matter where a person travels, whether it is to another state or another country, I think it is important to understand or know the norms and culture of the place, especially of a foreign country.
It helps to learn about the different perspectives that exist in the world because conflicts can be avoided, especially for military personnel.
Since 99% of the interactions between the military personnel and the other side do not involve combat, it is important to know how to engage in an effective conversation to protect a large number of civilians from being killed.
I think it is especially important to be aware of the main religion within the culture and country because religion, the majority of the time, is what runs the country by leading it into politics.
Being ignorant towards a religion creates a barrier, especially with the soldiers.
If soldiers do not understand about a religion, it would be difficult to find the solution to the problem.
Here in the United States, we are so numb to what goes on in the rest of the world.
We are so far away from most of the wars and the hate that goes on in the world, that it is hard to relate to the innocent civilians being affected by the wars.
I can only hope that they are one day able to continue their lives without having to be fearful every time they leave the house, and that us here in the United States we learn to empathize more with the ones that have to live their lives in fear each day.
And like you said I never picture all the civilians that are living in those areas or the tragedy they had to experience.
Also, hearing how Sam was comparing their cities to ours made things seem more similar to us rather how media portrays Afghan cities completely differently.
Not to mention learning about all the tragedies that were mentioned, if they were to have happened where I live, I know I would be devastated.
These innocent families who just want to live their lives peacefully, just like me, but cannot because of war.
When people think of war they only think of the fighting side versus the side that Colonel Garey was talking about during this presentation.
When I think of war the first thing that comes to my mind is fighting.
My older brother joined the military in 2008 during the war in Iraq when he was 19 years old.
Colonel Garey was saying that there are things that soldiers go through from those moments they've encountered of fear and sadness when out in the fields.
I have a photograph of my brother that was then during his time in Afghanistan with civilians.
I thought to myself wow, there is so much more to war than just fighting.
There is a part about war that is making sure the people that the people you're protecting, feel safe.
Colonel Garey struck a cord with me when speaking about the things that civilians really don't understand about the war.
I believe that they both provide good guidelines of morals that you may want to teach to your children but there isnt enough content to create concrete guidelines for something as large as a government.
I feel as though every religion share the same values.
Some Americans do not want more terrorist attacks.
This video was very interesting to me because it was my first time hearing about Afghan culture from an American who has actually experienced it first hand.
It was not surprising to hear that he was nervous when the village elder would invite him in for tea due the perception that people in Afghanistan want to kill Americans However, this man was just being polite as it is customary in their culture to invite visitors into your home.
I remember Sam talking about how we Americans and Afghans meet, the Afghan people come bearing gives while the Americans bring nothing even though the Afghan people generally have a lot less money.
Then they will be able to learn that the people of Afghanistan are not all about war, but they are people who want to live safe and peaceful lives like we do.
Unfortunately, because of this, we have created laws that prohibit the advocation of one religion over another or the intertwining of political legislation and religious belief (The Establishment Clause and Separation of Church and State).
Just as Sam pointed out in class, hypocritical American Christians will promptly slander Islam for the wrongdoings of extremists groups who murder and claim to be a follower of that religion.
If American Christians want to point the finger at an entire religion because of the feeble minded few, then I can do the same to them.
Its also not simply the actions of these groups that lead me to believe the bible is and has always been radicalized and that Christian Sharia is a real thing, its political framework and legislation.
Subsequently, to get around things and still use Christianity as an exploitation device, ignorant Christians create stupid things like Religious Freedom Acts, because apparently their religion that has murdered, extorted, enslaved, lied, cheated, and is and has been the dominant religion in the world since the beginning of time, is threatened.
The frustrating thing about that is that media shows us what it wants to show us, and the rest is up to our imagination.
I really would like to hear world news, war news from an unbiased perspective, so that I as a person could really consider all sides of the argument.
I feel like this has been a problem for a long time and this is just the way that news has always been.
Towards the end of the video, he says, The Quran is a template for how to live your life.
There are a lot of amazing lessons to take away from what is written in these religious books.
The way I see it, there are two possibilities that can happen from that.
When the person is ready, they will go on a spiritual adventure to see what they truly believe in and not what they've been told to believe for the totality of their life.
At that time Ronald Reagan was the president and under the Reagan Doctrine he believed that he must fight the soviet unions red scare at all cost.
The Mujahedeen are the Taliban they fought against the Soviet Union and now they turn the other direction and fight against the United States.
This is the first time that it has been brought to my attention that Christians do not see Muslims as christians although the Bible and the Quran kind of teaches the same morality in just different wording.
It sounds bad but it is the truth and I agree that if the statements do not promote love or understanding then we are most not doing the right thing.
Its very sad that because of what goes on over there on the warfront and the ever growing fear of terrorist attacks that soldiers have become so paranoid and fearful of such attacks happening to them that there has become a mindset that you can not trust anyone and that everyone is a bad guy.
I do believe that the military should find more ways to learn about the culture of the Afghan people to better distinguish actual culture lifestyles of the citizens of Afghanistan from real threats of attacks.
I think it is definitely beneficial to address the attacks that have been done on innocent afghan lives instead of trying to just forget or ignore that it happens.
I agree with what you are saying in this response.
If you go into a country and don't respect that then you are just showing ignorance.
I thought it was interesting how Rich was able to provide his real life experiences into perspective.
I feel like the media is so influential in what we see today that other countries are portrayed badly.
Separation of church and state is a cornerstone which the US was built on.
Our founding fathers thought it to be much safer if the two remained separate and did not consolidate power.
Although we view sharia law as extremist, we often dont realize that these ideologies can be present in our country as well.
I believe if we can recognize these issues, we can work towards implementation of strategies within the religious communities that help to develop an understanding of the religious texts that steers away from violence and can be interpreted properly.
Its also very interesting because we have to know where to draw the line in todays society.
When do these people with radical beliefs turn violent?
Its hard to say for certain, but its best to stop these types of hate groups before they have the chance to evolve into such organizations.
To further that, you also can start to see religion creeping into government with the law examples given.
Most were on the state level, but none the less, its remarkable that such laws exist in our nation.
This is a very interesting idea that I had not thought about previously.
I also think that the fact that the number of rape cases decreasing so extremely is obviously a great thing for women, but also just in general with regard to less crime being committed.
I do agree that right now for the sake of women, and what sounds like the general population as well, sharia law does seem like a good thing.
While these are all impressive and significant improvements I dont think the government should have the ability to tell people what they need to believe in.
That's why I wasn't surprised when our guest began to talk about them being in centuries of continuous war.
I just thought of them as foreigners that happened to live a different way of life than the average american, but my opinions have changed fast over the past year.
He was very kind to me and we got along, but never really clicked, and on to fall I went , with similar opinions.
I definitely agree with you on the fact that different groups of people interpret the text of the Bible in very conflicting ways.
I believe that the reason groups like the Westboro Baptist Church arise is because of how the Bible can be broadly (immorally) interpreted to justify anyones selfish and unethical agenda.
I think that groups who do this, specifically the Westboro Baptist Church, could not actually believe that they are doing the work that God has intended for them to do.
Nowhere in the Bible does it ever justify the use of hate speech in order to proclaim the Gospel.
The constant practice of justifying hate using the Bible and Quran needs to stop, because it is detrimental to the target groups and immoral, overall.
The way Sam was able to explain got me to understand how other people follow their own laws.
He used the idea of, Fish live in water, the last species to understand water, to know what water is, feels because the fish has lives there, their whole life.
What I was able to catch was Sharia law is a general form of teachings and stories to move us forward on how to live and view life.
Sharia Law is seen in a bad way, for instance because of their harsh punishments for acts such as adultery.
Sam also used the stealing of a paper clip as a good example to explain how people agree and disagree.
He asks us how some can take religious texts like the Bible or Quran, texts so often championing love and peace, and use them as a justification for war and hatred.
I think thats why we struggle so much with empathy.
Whenever you hear about Afghanistan, it is in the news and surrounding all the war and conflict in the middle east.
Because we are so far removed from the battlefield, we sometimes ignore the horrible conditions in Afghanistan.
Specifically, I thought it was incredible that we were shown pictures of Rafi and his family and learned about the dialogue being started between military cadets and civilians living in the combat zone.
I also found it very helpful that Sam kept reiterating the phrase real as it really drives home the point that these people are just like us, and really forces us to become aware of these awful civilian casualties and inspires us to become better educated about areas outside of our sheltered country.
However, I dont believe that by not talking about race issues it makes the lives of white people and or any privileged peoples lives better or more enjoyable.
I do like that you included statistics however because it brings up a very interesting topic along with racism.
While in class I realized how similar the Bible is to the Quran and how the messages and religion are basically the same but can be interpreted in various ways.
Also, I feel as though some extremist groups such as the KKK in the USA have already tried to radicalize the Bible while trying to use it justify as well as guide their hateful actions.
If the citizens of Afghanistan or Muslim followers are looked at in a negative way because of the many hateful actions of a few than the same could be done for Americans that claim to be Christian.
Many extremist and radicalizers are very hypocritical which is another reason why nothing would ever be solved by looking in the Bible or Quran.
My journey from a practicing Catholic to essentially an Atheist was largely driven by hypocrisy in the church, and more specifically in the interpretation of the Bible.
I found this topic particularly compelling because of my experience growing up.
In the recent years, with the tensions between the American People and Muslims, or anyone of Islamic descent, I have always tried to separate myself from the way the U.S. have treated these peoples.
Although I recognized that this was wrong and in my opinion, unlawful, I never saw the hypocrisy in it.
For instance, when Mike Pence signed The Religious Freedom Restoration, which gives businesses the right to reuse service if it conflicted with their religious believes, I was shocked.
However, I would not have thought of it, nor put it on the same level as Islamic Sharia until after Sams lecture.
I think that these sorts of bills should be compared to something we consider as horrible as Muslim Sharia.
They stand against everything the U.S. claims to be founded upon.
I thought LTC Gareys response was very fascinating.
He spoke of the perception the average person has of a soldier, he used the word robot to describe them.
I personally found this interesting because when I think of a soldier, often I think of an emotionless, fearless, robot like being.
He also spoke about another misconception people have about war.
His point was that we often dont realize how much time soldiers spend doing other things.
LTC Garey said something specific that I found very interesting.
I feel like if we ever want fighting to stop and relationships overseas to get better, the United States government needs to understand where our enemies are coming from.
I think thats how so many hate groups gain followers, they are compiled of uncultured people who are not willing to accept other peoples ideas and opinions.
If more people in power were willing to learn about other cultures, Id bet there would be a lot less conflict throughout the world.
That was something I will never forget.
I have never been someone who has supported war, but his experiences just made me hate it even more.
They try not to let war affect their lives although it does.
I think Rahfi made me better understand his religion the right way and not how the news and other sources explain it here in this country.
This man coming to speak to my class has influenced me to change my life and do something in my life to help others and make a difference in the world.
From now on, I will view life through an optimistic scope, and when I think things are not going my way and begin to complain, I know that there are people in much less fortunate situations than me.
I am thankful for people like LTC Gary, who are completely selfless, and put the well-being of others in front of their own.
Next when Sam started talking about how you really need to read the books to fully understand them it just spoke to me completely as a person because I feel like if I was to sit down and truly read the Bible I feel like I could so much overall about the religion and how some of the focused oats of it are being distorted from the parts that we all know about.
Also, from truly reading the Bible and fully understanding it I just feel like I could learn a lot as an individual and it would overall just change the way I view the world a little bit.
Lastly, this was probably rhea most interesting class for myself on a personal level because I feel like I just; earned so much about what was some of what I raised upon is like distorted in a way that the Catholic religion sees fit.
We shouldnt hate the people that come from a designated place just because we disagree with them as a whole.
They come from areas of poverty yet still see our country as one of its own.
I lost it during this part too, this was one of the funniest lectures so far.
For once in my life I actually look forward to, and enjoy attending an academic class.
Using humor makes it easier to talk about touchy and uncomfortable subjects, especially in this class Because Sam brings up things people think, but dont say out loud.
I completely agree that sometimes it's hard to see imagine the way things are on the other side of the world.
When Sam showed us pictures of shopping malls in Afghanistan and peoples homes and cars, I started to realize that Afghanistan is similar to us in many ways.
It's hard to imagine that our own government instills that fear into other civilians, and when we hear from them and their own personal stories and put names to faces we can sympathize with them.
I responded to the same video that you chose to and I completely agree with you that it is the individuals interpretation of the religious text that really matters.
When reading the religious texts, it really is just a book of stories.
The interpretation is the part that matters to incorporating the religion into daily life.
I dont really agree with you however when you say that we cannot consider radical people a part of their religion.
Whether they are a radical Muslim or a radical Christian, they do what they do in devotion to their religion.
The Christians that imperialized countries and tortured and killed other people werent by-the-book Christians compared to some interpretations of the New Testament, but I believe that they were still Christian because they were born Christian and lived their lives under the impression and intention that they were Christians.
I agree with what you have to say on television poorly portraying war along with video games.
I was taken aback as well when I heard Lieutenant Colonel Garey say that he had spent most of his time not even on a battlefield.
We are never really taught the tiny details about war and that can really hinder our thoughts on war.
Almost in all situations when talking about war you only hear one side of the fight and the country that you are fighting is the enemy.
Rafi was able to open up Americans eyes to what is happening in the Middle East from a civilians point of view.
I feel that war is sadly a necessary evil that we have in todays world.
It would be beneficial to be able to work out problems with other countries without having to actually fight and lose lives, but that is just really an unrealistic goal for humanity.
There are extreme groups in the world today whos views are so radical and dangerous that they are not willing to cooperate with governments whatsoever.
As you can see from Rafis stories, some people in the Middle East are a threat to his safety simply because he does not follow their ways.
One of Rafis own friends was murdered because he was working towards peace and also was not supporting the radical ideas.
It is saddening that by just doing his job, his life and his familys life is in constant danger.
Rafi has a family, just like the millions of families living in the US, yet his family is in constant danger from the constant fighting and wars that Afghanistan has experienced in recent history.
I do not think it would be possible to live such a life in the modern world.
At some point or another, they would have to make a choice between two things that force them to do something that goes against the teachings of the Bible.
When trying to teach people about these teachings, we often forget about the different viewpoints that may come along with it.
Due to this, I believe it's best that people live the lives that they choose and as they want.
It's just the way I want to do things throughout my life.
It's best that we live the life that we want, whether it be strictly based off the teachings of our religion or not.
Along with this, we have to respect others and the lives that they want to live as well.
I too agree that this is what Sam was going for.
Many of times, they are misinterpreted due tot the fact that it has been taken from sources spanning back thousands of years.
To some people who read these texts, they do not realize that the literal interpretation of a saying is only applicable to the time it was written in.
It is important to not take one verse out of context, because the next verse may justify a statement or explain in detail its meaning.
When these texts are taken the wrong way, they can be motivation for many outrageous acts, as we have seen.
I remember this class and this specific part caught my attention.
We as a country would have so much less hate and animosity toward Afghanistan if people took a step back and looked at Afghanistan as a country with real people in it rather than judging them based off what is portrayed in the media.
The opportunity to experience someone from Afghanistan with his perspective on the issues of war and how his country is being handled was something I found intriguing.
Seeing his daughters on the projector and hearing how he risks his life to defend their rights as well as all Afghanistan citizens was inspiring.
The fact that his partner was murdered for doing the same type of work that Rafi does really emphasized the risk Rafi puts himself in by speaking out against the problems in Afghanistan was something that would definitely scare me away if I were him.
I have a lot of admiration for those who serve our country and getting to hear his stories and perspective on Afghanistan was really cool.
You shouldn't try to force what you believe onto someone else because it's what you believe is right.
That's no different than someone forcing their religion onto you.
Be you and stop worrying about the way others are living their life.
Many people look at these two religions as being completely different, and would laugh at the thought that these two religions could be similar.
For example, a radical group of Christians in south America, as well as ISIS in the middle east both go around killing those who dont agree with their ideals, and both believe that they are doing the right thing.
Both groups interpreted their religious books to mean that by ridding the world of people who dont follow the same path that they do, they are following the way of their religious leader.
One such example would be Christians who are against gay marriage because it is against principles in the bible, but overlook other lines in the bible that state that divorce is also a sin.
On the other hand, many peaceful Christians and Muslims live out their lives following their respective books on a path that leads them to forgiveness and love.
I had never looked at the Quran close enough to realize how similar they were, and think this is an important lesson that should be taught on a broader scale to more Americans.
This clause is a good thing however the religious freedom bills destroy the good that comes from it.
These bills also allows them to not educate particular people, and this is all biased.
By the government not affiliating themselves with any particular religion, they maintain a fair playing ground for all races, however they also give too much power to those churches to discriminate within themselves however they please.
All of this pertains to Sharia law like Sam said, and I agree with what he is saying that Christians are moving towards Sharia law and Muslims are straying away.
The fact that Afghanistan has laws that prevent discrimination entirely meanwhile Americans are able to discriminate as they please goes to show a lot of things.
It seems that a lot of these issues should have been resolved years ago, and maybe they were resolved for the most part but it seems that there is a resurgence.
I've had a very similar experience in my life.
Since I was a child, I was raised as a Roman Catholic.
There were a lot of values and morals that I gained as a result of these teachings.
Going to these classes though, I was told about a lot of fantastic things that at the time sounded great.
Looking back at them now, I find it hard to believe everything I was told.
The lessons are so valuable, but they are not to be taken at face value.
Despite these doubts, I am also proud to have been raised the way I was.
It provided bonding among friends and family that would have been difficult to do without these teachings.
I was never a die-hard Christian; I went to church a few times a month with my mom and was part of a youth group when I was way younger.
It makes you wonder how can a religious belief be so loving and forgiving, yet be so cruel to such a large group of people?
Not everyone in America is a straight, obedient, Christian; so why do we continue to allow religious influence dictate our laws?
Religion and state need to gain some distance without that being a sin of itself.
People across the globe populate countries and violate these beliefs, but these beliefs should cease to exist.
These beliefs were written thousands of years ago and its time they adapt with humanity.
They chose what passages that were taught to them to hold onto and leave everything else in the dust.
It is saddening to me that those who are so blinded by their flimsy beliefs can cause so much damage.
Radicals force their will upon other human beings just because their mode of living is different.
Believing that the societal norms set forth by religion are the only truths in life is a system of belief that will only drive us backwards.
We need open minds, and free hearts to guide our society.
Although from what I took away from the video it was surprising to see the differences of the topic of divorce compared to our culture and theirs.
But it seems that if divorce is in the hand of the husband.
Although a woman can get a divorce she needs reasons to back up the divorce and it is a progress over time.
It seems that there is only 4 reasons of why to get a divorce which were, damaging and torturing, health problems, husband not being able to provide basic needs for life, and disappearance.
After one of these 4 reasons a wife would have to wait three years which to me I personally do not agree with because if someone is unhappy I feel they should have the freedom and capability to divorce at any time.
But it was interesting to see the balance as well in Afghanistan because a man cannot just get a divorce if he wanted to a man would still have to take care of all of the needs of his wife and family even after the divorce.
When most people hear of Sharia Law, they think of Islam and women having much less rights than men.
However, this conversation opened my eyes to what was right in front of me my entire life.
There are so many laws that come from the Bible and I think its wrong.
At the time these laws were created, I believe that religion and state needed to be one for society to progress.
Modern day society would have never developed if it were not for God-fearing men and women to follow common beliefs.
If men feared God, less people would commit crimes and cooperate with their neighbors.
Christian Sharia Law does not have a place in modern society.
I would not be able to imagine a world where oral sex and fornication, something that is no one elses business because youre in the privacy of your own home.
I was glad to hear about this topic in class because these realizations about Christianity were what began my personal exploration with different religions.
Christian or Muslim within each religion every individual has their own opinion on what the true words of God are.
There are countless opinions and debates about who is right and who is wrong, personally I think its impossible for there to be someone right or wrong because everything is open to interpretation.
Which creates the problem of what to do about those who radicalize the words of god.
Within both religions Muslim and Christianity there are people who radicalize select words within these books to support their own ideologies.
Just because these people have found passages that may support what they believe in, does not mean that it is a valid argument or morally right to believe in.
For example, Dylann Roof is an American Christian who took the words of god and used them to justify his actions for a mass murder.
This case received a huge amount of coverage within my society however, I feel that the media does not bring enough attention to Christian extremists in many cases.
But, the reality of the situation is that only a small portion of Muslims are extremists who have radicalized the words of good to fit their ideology.
Just like there is radicalized Muslims there are also radical Christians.
However, both religions are not scrutinized in the same ways but should be and just there are violent Christians and just because its not talked about doesnt mean its not happening.
It is a shame that some people don't think other people have a right to their own religion and try to force it on to other, when their religion is against it.
I chose to comment on this video because I think it was extremely interesting to have an inside perspective from a real Afghan on what it is like to live and work in the country during all of this conflict.
Not many citizens of the United States know anything about life for citizens in Afghanistan and the many hardships they face every day.
United States Citizens often have a sheltered view of the war because they rarely see the bad stories and never get too hear what life is like for a real citizen.
It was such a rare opportunity to actually hear first-hand from two separate citizens who have had friends and family killed and live stressful and hard lives every day.
Afghan citizens are normal people just like us who work and have families.
We often dont see this side of Afghan people we only see the minority of terrorists who harm the local people and cause chaos.
One way I think we as normal U.S. citizens can go against the Afghanistan war is to vote for leaders of our country that feel the same way we do about it.
We are extremely lucky to live in a country where we dont have to worry about our house getting bombed, or being assassinated for practicing our profession, or simply walking around our city.
I completely agree with this statement of we don't realize the extent of damage that is done to Afghanistan and other countries that are being directly affected by conflict.
I also think it is important to point out the quote they have the same hopes and dreams as everyone else.
Children, families and loved ones did not choose to be born and live in the middle of combat, but their destiny was chosen for them.
I think its crazy to think that children grow up not knowing the difference between peace and war.
We take for granted the privilege we have living in the United States, growing up in a safe environment, not living each day like it may be our last.
I think it is inspiring that through all the hate in war, some only want to find peace and prosperity for their people.
We all associate Afghanistan with war that people don't always see that they are looking for the same happy life we do in the US.
First of all, I want to start by mentioning how difficult the living conditions are for this poor Afghan civilian who is just trying to live a normal life like every one of us.
There is an amazing picture that I will attach in my post that describes the most intense and terrifying era in Panamanian history.
He fought so hard for his country that with the help of the United States, they managed to overthrow the dictator Manuel Noriega and was later named Vice President of Panama.
Examples like this one, is what give people hope that there is still a chance to restore faith in humanity.
It is really hard to imagine the other side of the war when we really only hear America's media describing the war from our point of view.
Basim really was a person that is admirable in every sense.
Almost his entire family was killed because of a mistake made by American soldiers, yet he still is compassionate and does not hate all Americans.
This man has every right to despise America because of how this horrible event unfolded and ruined his own life but he doesn't and that is what makes him so admirable.
Forgiveness is a core value to him and even when forgiveness in this case seems almost impossible, he is still able to forgive.
It is so unfortunate and heartbreaking that an innocent civilian lost so much in a conflict that he had no part of.
I agree with you because I chose to write about the same thing.
It's unfair to them especially because they do not choose to live through war.
Growing up Catholic, I was exposed to many people who believed that being Christian, specifically Catholic, was the right way to live.
I have heard people say when they see a criminal on the news who just committed a crime that that person isnt being very Christian, regardless of if the person was Christian or not.
I do think that many people think lesser of a person who doesnt believe in what they believe in, or someone who believes in nothing at all.
I do not understand this considering how some religions are so similar (Christianity and Islam).
It is unfair however to make this assumption because there are bad people from almost every religious group.
If people want to judge religions they should read the according holy book for that religion and interpret the religion for themselves.
It was just so cool to learn how basically every single one of these things that is actually mentioned in this passage is basically something that a person around their 20s has most certainly violated.
With that being said does that mean like Heaven is basically something that will never be possible for anyone anymore because of the way we are as humans and because of the ways how there is always temptation out in the world and only falling for it once is going to kick out of getting into Heaven completely?
It makes me crawl out of my skin to hear innocent children who do not even understand the concept of war are caught in the cross fire losing their lives and are injured from these occurrences.
That the US is the powerhouse of all conflict and when we send our soldiers out they only are at combat.
The government shelters society of what it is like for our military once they are deployed.
Growing up, I also questioned why certain sins were punished at a greater degree than others.
I think the atrocious acts committed against Muslim people are also easy for many U.S. citizens are easy to ignore also because the media also reports on it as a side note, rather than a big deal.
If the media reported on it the same way 9 11 was, I think there would be a huge shift in people's opinions.
I am on the other side of things, so I can't relate but I can understand where you are coming from in a certain sense.
That comment Sam said about War being a real thing and not just out there really struck me, because I've always just thought of it as something out there.
Also, it bothered me that a lot of the people that are in this war don't even want it to be happening, as they fight a political war for a reason they don't even really understand.
I just hope everyone understands the damages they are doing before its too late, and Im afraid the time is sooner rather than later.
He said something that moved me he stated that we will win the fight because peace always wins.
I cannot believe that he continues his work even though he has received death threats daily and could easily die at any moment.
He has death threats coming from the Taliban that is terrifying.
I do not know if I could do that.
Death has always been my number one fear and it is truly amazing and inspirational to me that he continues to fight regardless of the risks that come with it.
However, he has such a great drive and continue since he wants to make a change and he knows that if he stops then who else would do it.
Yes there are obvious genetic mutations which occur over time due to Darwinism however pointing out how we are all 99.9% genetically similar just does not make for a valid argument.
Putting things into prospective, we are only about 10 times different from chimps than we are to each other.
The argument can be made that since according to science, humans evolved from chimps and thus there are obviously going to be blaring similarities.
However, once it is put into prospective and compared tochimpanzees, you realize that 1.2% puts you an organism into an entirely different genus and species.
I didnt know the meaning of sharia either, and Sams class really helped me to understand this term, as well as to better understand the way radicals in both religions read what they want to read.
Sams specific examples really brought this to light, like when he examined how some Christians will pick and choose which sins are acceptable to commit, and which ones will prevent one from redemption.
This class really brought to light how some religions will demonize members of other religions, and sometimes members of their own religion, for some of the same things they themselves do.
Sam asked the class if we were able to decipher between people who are of Native American ancestry, Chinese ancestry, European ancestry, Asian ancestry, and European ancestry.
However, after I thought about it more, I was able to see man similarities among all the races and soon realized that I was not as sure as I initially thought of my race assumptions.
The Own Race Bias is the idea that people are often more aware of differences in features between people of their own race, whereas it is more difficult for people to notice differences in faces of people of different races.
This is often why people think people of other races tend to look similar, as I realized I thought during this activity.
As much as I would like to not, it is very difficult when I am constantly surrounded by people of the same race as my own.
As learned in class, cities in Afghanistan are being bombed and sometimes by accident.
This shows how war affects real people, in real cities, with real families that live in real houses.
The Venezuelan people are going through an era of civil war, a situation that I will use as a metaphorical representation of a war zone from the point of view of a civilian.
First of all, doing daily tasks and simple errands take a whole day instead of a couple of hours because you have to avoid certain areas of the city that are being affected by the peaceful protests.
Although, the most crucial occasion that is affected is the health care and the hospitals.
Doctors cant get to the clinics to treat their patients, and the other way around because streets are blocked for hours.
In Afghanistan, this is magnified because of the nature of the war they are experiencing.
People talk about war and the military all the time, but everyone need to culturize themselves and be aware that people just like them are being affected too.
No one really wants to believe that the way they think is wrong or is not as good as someone else's.
This leads people to believe that the rest of the world would be better off if everyone adopted their beliefs and followed them as law.
In the US, the media shows us sharia through the actions of extremists like ISIS, but that sharia istheirinterpretation of the Quran.
There are unlimited different interpretations and it is unlikely that any two people will have exactly the same interpretation of everything.
This is why a government with very specific legislation is so important.
Sharia is based on a single, limited book that was written hundreds of years ago, whereas US law has the ability to change and grow as times change or new scenarios arise as a result of new technologies.
This legal system is also the thing that prevents Muslim sharia law from ever taking place in the US.
This is not too surprising, as those Christians who are very religious and support Christian laws would probably feel most threatened by other religions that they believe are trying to change their way of life, regardless of whether or not they truly are.
They too believe that their way of thinking is the right way, and then see groups with very different ways of thinking who are forcing their belief on others and become frightened that this will happen to them.
This week I watched the video titled The Importance of Military to Know Other Cultures where Sam talks to Lieutenant Colonel Richard Garey, the head of Penn States Army ROTC program about his time in Afghanistan.
In this specific video, it focuses on American troops adapting to the way of life in a third world country like Afghanistan.
Garey goes on to tell a story about his first tour in Afghanistan he went to a village in search of a Taliban member and the village elder asked him to come to his house for tea and he refused again and again so he wouldnt open up about the information Garey was in search of.
It was only once Garey finally decided to have tea with this man that he opened up and told Garey everything he wanted to know about the Taliban and the customs of that specific village which I thought was really cool.
It really shows how different the culture is in Afghanistan compared to here and how something as simple as a cup of tea can open up a dialogue to gain all the information he wanted to know.
I found this lecture interesting because I did not know what Sharia Law was until Sam explained it.
There are countless ways someone can interpret a passage in the Quran which is why I dont think a religious book filled with stories should be used to govern people.
After this lecture, I was compelled to do some of my own research on Sharia Law, known as the law of Islam.
Also meaning path in Arabic, sharia guides all aspects of Muslim life, including daily routines, familial and religious obligations, and financial dealings.
Compared to other legal codes, Sharia law also prioritizes punishment over rehabilitation.
The list of Sharia Laws that I found online is quite extensive and aims to integrate certain passages from the Quran into how people should live their daily lives and how they should be punished.
A lot of these laws seem cruel and hateful, something that the Quran does not encourage no matter how you interpret it.
It is the extremists of those religions that reflect poorly on the religion as a whole.
I do believe it is fair for people to interpret their holy books in their own way, but extremists and radicals are completely irrational and interpret everything wrong.
I too hope that all religions, and even races can someday get along.
Like you said, a lot of people are misguided, and its time people start guiding others in the right direction.
I use to find myself in that fishbowl that Sam speaks of and I personally noticed how consumed I was in my culture that I failed to truly noticed everything else that was happening around me.
It wasnt until after I escaped the fishbowl, I noticed that I became way more open to learning and opening my eyes to different cultures.
Towards the end of the lecture we realized that Sam identified as the person who could hopefully help us get out of our fishbowl.
I agree with you, but I think that my religious experience was a little bit different than yours.
He tends to kind of ignore those other things you mentioned, such as how to get into heaven etc.
I like this approach because it promotes an overall positive way of living life and treating other people.
Some people would probably dislike this though because it tends to just try and paint Christianity in a more positive light by ignoring parts that are controversial.
The one thing that I love about my pastor is that he actually puts into practice the things he preaches by serving the community.
Although I did not know someone directly affected by the tragedy of 9 11, I also held the same belief of you afterwards: that the middle east was filled with bad people that only wanted to destroy the U.S. Now, after being introduced to such a diverse population as Penn State, I also realized how ignorant I was to the truth about middle eastern cultures.
I had come to the conclusion that I likely misjudged them as a whole but when Rafi spoke to us, I was assured of my ignorance.
When he talked about inviting American soldiers in for tea it really caught my attention.
For this case, it was to portray all of the middle east as the enemy when in reality it was a few extremists from these places causing all the harm.
Raf was so amazing to have in our class and it was awesome to hear everything that he had to say.
It was truly heartwarming to see how a man who has seen so much evil in his life to still see good in the world.
Speaking for myself, I would be filled with such hatred after experiencing the things that Raf has experienced.
Raf is putting his life in danger by trying to bring about peace and helping his country.
If more people were like him than our world would have a better chance at putting all the hate behind us and working on a peaceful way to bring people together.
First I thought it was very interesting when you talked about how often times people dont want to accept that a real war is happing in Afghanistan.
That picture made me think of a traffic jam I have seen in my own city, and to think of trying to go through a normal daily routine with a war happening outside is insane.
The idea that a bomb could be dropped on the shopping mall I go really shocked me.
That is because there are not clear answers to the questions they have in their holy books.
Holy books like the Bible were written to be the guideline to life: politically, socially, and economically.
However, the burning questions as to why they are an abundant amount of religious disputes are because pf the way people interpret their respective religions holy book.
Thats the way I interpret it.
Others, such as members of ISIS, have other beliefs about the what Islam is about.
And disagreements amongst people regarding these questions is in some aspect a reason to why violence happens in the world.
Its interesting that he focuses a lot on the aspect of using the bible to decide about getting divorced, because many christians frown upon the idea of getting a divorce.
But he then furthers this point to say that even if we wanted to, there is so little in the bible about it compared to the millions of pages of laws and bylaws regarding divorce.
Another really good point that he made was the different views people have in regards to the bible even though they are all part of the same religion.
So you have people of the same religion who cant agree on aspects of their own religion, and yet they would be in charge of creating laws for a large and diverse population that includes other religions.
Lastly, it was hard to notice it until Sam pointed it out, but the Koran and the Bible are actually fairly similar.
In practice, they are both books that teach about certain beliefs and why you should or should not partake in certain activities or ideas.
I absolutely agree with you and have too been bothered by this Rethinking War section.
This whole section about war has been more than eye-opening, but really touching to the heart.
It was heartbreaking to hear about his tragic story, which was at the hands of the United States.
It's unimaginable to even try to put myself into his shoes, losing everything that was of great value to him.
I was shocked that he forgave the United States simply because his religion tells him that he should.
Even news outlets rarely report on many of the bad things the U.S. has done in Afghanistan and never reports on our countrys motive for starting the war.
Most Americans do not have an opinion on the war because its so far away.
As Professor Richards mentioned, we look at Afghanistan as just a place on the map.
Meanwhile, there are real people there with real families that have to live their lives in a warzone.
That could have been me in that mall if the United States were to be bombed.
I believe that if more people even watched this eight minute video there view on the war would dramatically change.
It was shocking to me that this was one of the first of several pronouncements in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, reading that government cannot start a church or pass laws that aid any religion or promote one religion over another.
The politics of race within groups is also seen within national politics with the President often calling on hate to achieve a certain agenda.
However, parts of the nation are obviously quite responsive to the bigotry used to elicit hate and racism.
If we just stopped making race a big deal, we wouldnt have to speak about it, or make everything about it.
Giving attention to a problem can fix things, but giving too much attention to it can make it worse.
The one thing that gets to me the most about the race issue in America is the quotas no one talks about in institutions and work places.
Everyone knows they are there, but there is no way to define that its wrong.
The other thing that bothers me is if the colored person gets the job over the white person, it is to fill the quota.
If the colored person does not get the job, its because of racism.
There really is no winning with the standards of American society when dealing with race.
Nowadays, India is a little more progressive, but not to the point that everyone is equal.
This man who had nothing to do with the war, has lived In America, and committed absolutely no crime, had his entire life changed in a day.
But on class this day, Sam took us through all the stages of empathy and it made me feel all sorts of emotions.
Then, we learned that his wife, daughter, brother and nephew, were all killed when his house was bombed.
His wife, was only feet away from him when she died.
I could not believe that this mans life was destroyed because of a random mistake made by people in power.
People who would never have to worry about this war affecting anything other than their career.
I knew that civilian causalities existed, but had never even taken more than a moment to feel for these people.
I just wish more Americans thought the way Bassim does.
How nave could we be to hate this country just because there is a war.
When will people realize that life is too short to have anything but love in their heart?
It is unbelievable to be exposed to a man who lives his life through his religion.
It is people like Basim who inspire me to become a better person everyday and I do not understand how he would not want to seek revenge and cause hurt to the people who ruined his life and family.
It is truly inspiring how he lives his life on the idea of forgiveness and how he can be so poised after such a tragedy like this.
It is amazing how after this tragedy he continues to keep moving forward with no regrets and living his life to the fullest potential.
Basim is my idol, and whenever times get tough, I know not to make excuses because there are other people who have lost so much and continue to keep striving for greatness.
Some people find that it's easier to hide behind the phone than to ask questions in person, especially in a class this big with 700 people.
I personally can't speak in a class with 50 people let alone 700 without getting nervous.
Personally, I did not grow up with religion in my life, but I understand how important it is for some people.
I also understand exactly what Sam was saying, how it can be interpreted to meet the needs of whatever point is being made.
She promised that she would not take part in premarital sex, but once she got a boyfriend, it was suddenly okay to do.
I wish she was here for this class because it shows that she is not better than the rest of us, and it is okay to have her own morals that she follows, even if she doesn't follow the bible exactly.
There are many different interpretations and some parts are more important partsthan others.
We get this mindset that Afghanistan has nothing but evil terrorist who hate America and it's citizens.
We need to of away with the misconceptions so many Americans have of the Afghanistanand start communicating better with them.
I am not educated enough to speak on the progress the war in Afghanistan has or has not had, but seeing the effects it has on people like Rafi and Basim was truly sad and if there is any way to reach peace in the near future we should strive for it.
Christian Sharia is a bit of an unsettling concept thats been settling into my brain since listening to this lecture, because its a strong showcase of how hate can seep into even the most outwardly positive aspects of society.
In the context of Bibles handed out on the street, this is relatively innocuous, but any kind of organized group that might be evangelizing is going to have its own spin on whatever source of belief is, and in a way, that is scarier than the idea of a single overwhelming religious group.
The obvious comparison is the clash between Shiite and Sunni beliefs, and how that sort of intense religious conflict can damage a region, but even in the U.S. the conflict between mainstream Christianity and the white supremacist fringe groups that have been becoming more active recently (speaking in the short term).
Many people, myself included, only see it from the perspective of a news outlet and we should be thankful for opportunities like the ones we have in class to get a deeper look at the devastation.
This closer perspective allows us to catch an unfiltered glimpse of the raw impact war has on everyone involved.
Many people are overridden by religious motivation, financial gain, or political influence and could not be bothered to think of the consequences their acts of war bring to everyone but themselves.
It is definitely fun to see that students can use the twitter hashtag for the class but i also think it is more beneficial if anything to be able to address and ask questions about certain things on it when you may not be able to say it in class yourself.
I can agree that Sam would never want anyone to feel vulnerable to being attacked by certain beliefs people have in the class.
I am with you on the fact that there are more pros than cons to using social media in the class in that we can interact with one another to make the class feel more like a family.
He definitely did a good job of addressing and hopefully fixing the issue of the snarky comments that were made.
He never said we were not aloud to disagree with peoples statements in the class but to do so in a professional manner where we arent trying to deliberately make someone look foolish or hurt someones feelings.
I loved how Sam opened the lecture with showing the class a side of Afghanistan westerners rarely see.
For many of us, it doesn't affect our daily life, even if we have family who serve or have served.
We dont remember that there are millions of people who live with the daily threats of war.
I also think many Americans forget that real and innocent people are caught in the crosshairs of war caused by governments and extremists.
We forget innocent men, women and children who want nothing more than to live peacefully have their homes destroyed, families ripped apart and lives taken.
Were all just humans with dreams and accomplishments who want to live peacefully and happily with family and friends.
Living their day to day lives, going to school, going to work, yet they are in a war zone.
Could you even imagine leaving for school and not knowing if it is the last time you are going to see your family?
We never seem to put ourselves in other people's shoes and we take so many things for granted.
This is the life that they are used to which is so sad to think about.
One thing this class has taught me is to be aware of everything else happening in other countries and not just focus on the United States.
There so much picking and choosing involved in whats deemed heretical or whatever but no one really seems to talk about that.
Its interesting to me how society can over time come together to pick on a handful of things to condemn, but give a pass not treat as harshly some other aspects of sins in the Bible.
I really tried when I was younger, but it hasnt really *struck* me at this point in my life.
The amount of privilege and slack Christianity gets in this country is kind of wild.
So much blood has been shed and many lives have been changed to due to the people trying to spread the word so much.
Colonialism in Africa for example had a lot of people convert over to Christianity in their respective colonies, but thats a different topic for a different day I guess.
I wonder if well ever be able to move past the damage we have done to people in the name of religion.
But people are still going to die for other peoples religions probably.
Personally, I would not consider myself to be religious in any sense; I dont go to church, and I dont really know what I do believe dont believe.
But I think if I was religious, I would be Christian.
But it has always frustrated me when religious people discriminate against gay people, for instance, because I feel like God just wants everyone to love and be accepting of each other.
Similarly, when Sam brought up hate groups, and how a lot of people in the South are very Christian, some things continued to just not add up in my mind.
The South is known for being dominantly Christian, and Im sure most of the people that live there are from there are kind and I dont mean to come off as judging them in any way.
But, the South is also known for a lot of people still supporting Confederate ideals, while still considering themselves to be Christian.
Sam also talked about the Lords Resistance Army a little bit, which I do not know much about except for the little bit of information I found about it on the internet.
This groups used to be classified as terrorists by the United States, because they performed many acts that violated human rights.
However, Sams argument that the Bible leaves out a lot of vital information makes sense to me.
The Bible is filled with generalizations and granted can provide us with wisdom, however I find it tough to live my whole entire life based on the Bible.
To me, it is all about personal interpretation, if you so choose to follow the Bible.
I believe it is meant to be seen in numerous ways because life simply is not one sided, its full of complexities.
He also talked about the constant debate there is on how to interpret the bible and also the Quran, and how both Muslim and Christian societies do the same.
One thing I was wondering is the extent to which it debated in the United States government.
However, on the conservative side, there are people who make religious arguments, but not all.
In some places in the middle east, the people do not really think about the country borders, which were drawn by Europeans, but at their tribal group.
Most of these countries consist of tribal groups, which have different interpretations of the Quran, which causes great conflict in some areas.
The same thing has happened in Europe, where different sects of Christianity have clashed over how to interpret the bible.
When Rafi started talking about what the Quran says about divorce I was kind of shocked.
But the fact that the divorce is in their hands, and even after a separation they are compensated by their husband is an amazing fact.
They fear what society would say, and when I say they I mean women more so then men.
Now this is all in very orthodox Indian societies, in modern day societies its a little more understandable but still no where near what the Quran says how women should be treated during such an event.
The husband, such as in my culture, should not be seen as the victim and nor should the wife be treated badly because in the end its their business and no one else should intervene.
Im happy to hear that women in countries like Afghanistan have more of a say in such a matter rather then being shunned for living their live, no women should ever feel inferior for any reason especially not when it involves their marriage and the rest of their life.
This makes me a person growing up in the United States more aware of my childhood experiences and recognizing that there was a large amount of differences in culture.
Some might think that citizens of Afghanistan must be used to war by now, after living through it for the last decade.
The only difference is that Afghans live in a war zone and must deal with the unease and misfortune that accompanies this difficult situation.
It is very true that many religious people like to pick and choose what rules they follow in their religion.
This is obvious and can be seen in many of the examples you provided above.
This can be seen in Christianity as some Christians are accepting of everyone and others actively participate in hate groups like the KKK and discriminate against people who are not like them.
This is also obvious with Muslims because there are groups of peaceful people like Rafi and there are also people in terrorist organizations who are consistently trying to kill others.
As you said, both groups have good and bad people and they people should not be judged solely on their religion.
The war in Afghanistan is interesting because there has never been a time in my life where I knew there to be no war occurring in Afghanistan.
I think that if I had grown up in a generation where the war began halfway through my lifetime, or if the war had began recently, rather, I would be able to understand more easily how the civilians feel who live there and that the country as a whole is peaceful.
In the same way that I have no way of understanding how airports were before 9 11, I have no way of being able to understand Afghanistan before it was a war zone.
It is absurd to see so many people do evil things like murdering or hurting other people and then justify that it was because of the higher powers message in the religious literature.
You cant blame an entire religion or those who follow that religion for actions that only certain people of that religion do.
It is not fair to blame people who arent responsible or even agree with other peoples evil actions.
However, that it not to discredit the girls of my race because I am attracted to them as well.
In a sense, I do not really have a type, but if I find you attractive I will shoot my shot.
The only difference I find with girls of the opposite race is that you have to find different things to relate to since they are from different cultures.
Just like girls from all races, there are things that I may find attractive and things that I may not, but I do feel like trying new things would be a good experience either way.
The only challenge lies when you have to bring the girl back home and see how your parents react to the situation.
LinkFirst of all, I have to say it is extremely encouraging what Raffi is doing with those women back in Afghanistan by risking his life every single day.
The thing that drives me the most at the end of the day is my family and my their future, which is basically the same as Raffi.
Something that called my attention that Raffi was talking was that he said it was his responsibility to do this work.
Because you could probably say it is not Raffi's actual responsibility but is is more something that he feels he needs to do in order for him to see a brighter future for his people.
I also don't have that responsibility of building and providing for a future family but I also, just as Raffi, feel the need to do it.
This people are willing to give a big portion of their lifes to help others.
People like Raffi deserve so much better and we got to find a way to pay them.
I thought they all prayed 5 times a day and chose to cover themselves.
When Sam compared them to Christians, this completely changed my point of view and somewhat clicked in my head.
I am also not a strict follower of the bible, however I am Christian.
When compared to Christians, I became more aware of how similar Muslims are to me.
However, in hearing from Rafi and Richard I feel like I am getting a better idea of the realities taking place, which only lends to more confusion.
I understand that quest for riches and power are what lead to the control and destruction inflicted by groups like the Taliban, but even so I find the war against peace and attempted peacemakers, like Rafi and his partner, to just be incomprehensible.
When there are people out there working towards peace and equality I am baffled by other just essentially saying no to those causes and intentionally creating a less safe, more wicked world.
When there had been a society that was growing and thriving how could a group go in there and take away their progress and all of the things being achieved?
However, I was happily surprised when Richard Geary was speaking about women voting, honestly here I feel like we learn that women are completely without rights and learn that they are basically treated as less than people through media and I'm glad that my eyes are being opened to see that it's not true.
I really think I will research further into the motives and goals of groups like the Taliban because while on the outside I hear where their ideas come from, I cannot comprehend putting them to action and going against the struggle for peace.
I strongly believe in not using a book based on religion to dictate how the morals, ethics and laws that will be in our society.
Who is to say that a religion in specific should be the basis to tell us how to live our lives?
One of the many reasons as to why I believe this shouldn't happen is because of what Sam says around the middle of this video, and is that not everyone interprets the bible the same way; just like all the other religious books.
I believe that your religion, your faith, your believes should be something private and personal.
I, personally am not a very religious person, which I think is anotherreason why I dont think our law should be based on the bible.
I think it was good that he used this subject to show the common areas of both Islamic and Christian religions, because in reality, they really arent all that different.
Therefore, I think this was a good point to bring up to the class.
However, Sam also brought up the topic of Christian Sharia in the context of how religious freedom can make it hard for the LGBTQ community to get any rights.
Yet, on the topic of gay marriage, I think that any religions can and should be allowed to have the freedom to deny marrying a couple if they feel that doing so would not coincide with their beliefs.
Gay marriage is legal in our country now, and I think that is great and people should have the right to be with whoever they want to be with.
But as these practices do not align with my faith, I wouldnt feel comfortable for gay marriage to be allowed within my Church simply because it goes against many of the teachings of the Catholic Church.
In this country, there are many things that people do that I do not agree with, yet I respect the differences in everyones beliefs because we live in a great nation that allows us to hold different ideals and ideologies.
I thought it was very insightful to have a first hand experience from Rich and Raffi.
To be honest I was quite surprised that military personal has such positive interactions with the Afghan citizens.
It really highlighted to me the huge impact that the media must be having in the United States.
As an international student, my country is not as involved in the Afghan war and therefore the media coverage of the situation in Afghanistan or Iraq may not be as prevalent in our media sources.
However, when thinking about war and tragedy it is often difficult to relate to and think about who the war may be affecting citizens lives.
Its interesting that you highlight that the Afghani culture may be more social and friendly in some ways.
If people followed Christian Sharia Law in the United States, I honestly think the world would be worse than it is now.
Today we live in a semi judgmental world where you can pretty much do whatever you want, via smoking, drinking, gambling, pre marital sex etc, and have no real repercussions.
If CSL (Christian Sharia law) came to the United States, it will essentially take away everything we know today.
No family guy , no simpson's , no south park, mandatory school prayer, chapel, or church service 4 days a week if not more, capital punishment etc, but at the same time I feel like it would be less crime, and wrong doing in the world, via prostitution, crimes against women, and children, murder etc, though women wouldn't really have no rights to begin with .
I should be able to do what I want without having repercussions, and If CSL was brought here nobody will be able to live how they want to live.
I googled CSL and got some pretty disturbing results, CSL is equivalent to the fundamentalist party which basically means homeschooling , chapel 4 or more days a week .
going to a private christian college, basically keeping your children under a rock so they won't be tempted to indulge in regular culture via, dating, social media, peer groups etc .
I absolutely loved the way he explained this.
The Westboro Baptist Church is notorious for bashing gay people, but they clearly haven't read the rest of the passage.
I'm always baffled by the hatred some of these Christians display, but it doesn't say anywhere in the Bible to act like that.
My aunt decided to disown her daughter when she found out that she was marrying her longtime girlfriend because it was against her religion.
However, my aunt is divorced and had a child out of wedlock, yet she still considers herself a good Christian because she disowned her daughter.
It's disappointing that she calls herself a good Christian and that she can ruin her relationship with her daughter even though she has sinned more than her daughter.
What also bothers me is how Americans don't understand that Christianity and Islam are not that different.
I never thought it about it that way, but that's exactly what it is.
ISIS is literally pushing their idea of Islam on people, while some people in the US are doing the same thing.
Your experiences varies from his, so don't discount that.
While it would have been nice if LTC Garey could go in depth of what each branch does, and their individual jobs respectively, that's a bit out of the scope of the conversation at and.
I have always thought that a book that was written 2000 years ago is not fit to decided law in the modern time.
What Sam says in this video goes hand in hand with that.
How can we determine who were to receive the vehicle in a divorce, or what if there is a business interest at hand?
There are simply too many modern-day aspects that are not even address in the Bible or Quran.
Also, I agree with him when he mentioned how all of the different groups of people all identify as Christians.
Some might say that the white supremacists are not truly Christians, but in their eyes they are.
Who are we to tell someone what religion they are?
So in their eyes, they are true Christians following the word of Christ himself.
So in the end, we have no basis behind trying to not classify them as Christians.
I find the same similarity when speaking about Muslim terrorists in ISIS.
That being said, I do not think that they are nearly the same as the everyday Muslim who is rational.
I thought this was interesting because Sam was telling a predominantly Christian class that hate groups exist within their own religion.
I thought this was very important because it shows people that extremists are not unique to Islam, as some people believe they are.
However, in that same 2013 Pew Study 79 percent of respondents favored a death penalty for leaving Islam, 37 percent believe it is often justified to kill a woman for dishonoring her family and 30 percent believe men and women should have equal inheritance rights.
This poll also made me wonder if Sam consciously avoided mentioning any statistics which did fit the perception that Sharia law in Afghanistan was similar to law in the United States.
During class, Sam Richards discussed how civilians and military personnel have a specific understanding of how war works, and it affects others, particularly those in the country in conflict.
Often times, these different groups have difficulty understanding war from the perspective other groups.
In the lecture, Sam Richards went on to explain how civilians dont see how war affects military personnel, from being moved to a hostile, foreign place, to engaging in firefights and other split second decision making situations.
Civilians however on the hand, attempt to understand war from a humanitarian standpoint, in which conflict could be avoided, and the problems handled in a cordial matter.
These differing viewpoints can at times cause disagreements between the military and civilian population, however, it is imperative, from both standpoints, for the groups to try and understand the complex nature of war from a military perspective, and one from a civilian perspective.
The second video Im going to discuss is the lecture when the class got the opportunity to talk to Bassim Razzo, whose wife, nephew, brother, son, and dog were all killed during the United States invasion of Iraq in the post 9 11 era.
However, I am confused when you bring liberals into your viewpoint.
In America, I think we see this problem with Christianity so often becauseit is the dominant religious group, like other dominant groups (such as racial groups, gender, class), they are empowered and feel their ideologies are the default and right way.
I agree that many people in the U.S created these violent stereotypes that all people living in Afghanistan are dangerous, aggressive and a threat because of the terrorist attacks on 9 11.
Most Americans believe all Afghanistan's are against the U.S when that is not the case.
If other Americans had the opportunity to speak and listen to Rafis story they would understand more and see how alike Afghanistan's are to us.
It has been years since any country has invaded us, and that in itself is a blessing, but we dont truly understand what it feels like for the other less fortunate countries.
As I write this there is some family in a war ridden country, such as Afghanistan, going through hardships we could only imagine.
However, our media doesnt show that family rather they show such orthodox Muslims who believe their way is the only way, but that is not all Muslim people.
We can not judge a group of people for the actions of only a small handful, that is not fair nor just.
We use what the media shows us as our take on the world, but there are people out there that just want peace and prosperity.
Who are we to judge a group of Muslim people based on the actions of ISIS, why do we look at people who wear turbans or are brown with a discerning eye, we as a whole need to stop being ignorant.
I believe ignorance is the reason for so much hate, ignorance leads to misunderstandings and it is because of that people do no see the real problem at hand and only focus on the small details.
What I found so interesting about this class in particular was that we were able to get two different perspectives of the war because we had both an American soldier, and an Afghan citizen speaking to us about their experiences.
In this video in particular, Sam focuses more on the aspect of the people who live in Afghanistan.
Personally, I really only thought of Afghanistan as a place where war was happening, not a place that so many people call home.
I believe that this is the case for me because no one talks about Afghanistan in any other way, besides it being a war zone.
Whenever I heard anyone say anything about Afghanistan, it has all been war related, so all I ever really associated that country with was war.
What also grabbed my attention in this video was the statistics that Sam put up about civilian deaths.
I also agree with you about how the public makes unjust generalizations specially about Afghani and middle eastern people.
I believe that this characterization is due to what is played constantly on the news cycles.
Pervious to speaking with Rafi I never really thought Afghanistan to have a normal society or be a normal country and I feel as though I just assumed for this country to be less safe.
Religion is not a topic that I am very familiar with.
I do not devoutly practice one religion but I am aware of the fact that all people are different even if they are bonded by the same practices.
What really struck me about what Sam showed in this lecture was the images of all the different hate groups in the nation that claim to be Christians.
When you look at these groups and see the kinds of things they do, Christianity and religion are some of the last things that come to mind.
However, in their eyes they're following the words of the Bible.
This idea sounded weird to me at first but the more I thought about it, the more I realizedthat it was true.
We've come so far and broke so many boundaries to become the more progressive society that we are today.
Especially our generation, I feel like we are so much more open to change.
These people are the ones that inspire the misconceptions that we have about the multiple religions.
I am not an orthodox Christian, nor am I highly religious, which means that just like you I wasn't aware of the reasons one could be excluded from heaven.
This is because we probably don't read the bible on our free time or immerse ourselves fully in our religion so we are easy to manipulate into believing stuff that we don't know about.
In my womens studies class we were watching a documentary that was commenting on how Disney and how they represented certain groups of people.
The way the media portrays the Middle East has only gotten worse in my opinion.
In countries where one religion is practiced it seems as though people don't become resentful or skeptical of their religion.
I think it makes sense tat you hold onto the basic morals and ideas from Catholicism because those are instinctual parts of being good while things like abstaining from sex are not.
There aren't instinctual or moral causes to abstain from sex once someone reached a mature age except for personal choice.
Maybe if we were living in a place where Catholicism was the norm in society and its influences we wouldn't feel doubt towards it.
One thing I reallylike about Sam as a teacheris that he always tries to incorporate a lesson of empathy in his lectures.
Bringing Rafi and Officer Garey into class really showed us what it was like to be so close to war.
Everyone always assumes the war is dealing with bad people and bad intentions but Officer Garey assured us that these people are real and more caring and hospitable than most Americans.
The brutal honesty is that many people don't understand that so many wars and so many sacrifices and violent things have been done under the name of religion for the longest time ever.
People really have misconceptions about how Afghanistan looks because nobody has really been there during these times.
I also agree with your statement that certain racist and sexist ideas presented in religious books are pass their time and do not fit into modern society.
The picture of the shop is also part of the video that stuck out to me.
The increasing number innocent afghan civilians killed is mind blowing.
Its upsetting knowing that people who are dealt with living in Afghanistan have a higher chance of dying just because they could be caught in the crossfire of this war at any moment.
Even military personnel of the USA have been losing their lives over a war that probably should have ended long ago.
I really liked what he said at first, that, The way we live our lives, a lot of times, we are like fish in water.
The only things I heard about Sharia Law before this class had a strong negative connotation.
Again, never having crossed paths with someone who abides by it, I havent had to understand it.
Another thing that stood out to me in the video was that Sam said the Qaran and the New Testament were similar from a sociological point of view.
Also, I live 5 minutes from New Jersey and people over in New Jersey speak differently as well.
It is interesting to see how our environments that we live can affect the way one speaks, their appearance, values, clothing choices, etc.
When someone who talks to me that has an accent I usually am able to tell where they are from.
From personal experience I realized how fake these people are that go to church every Sunday.
Even though it is wrong to judge people I still started to make some observations.
I kinda think that it would just go back to how things are somehow and some way history would correct itself to how it is currently.
I agree that as citizens of America we need to educate ourselves on the world that we are living in and be aware of what is going on around us, and most importantly what we are doing to our world because the media does not show us the realities of America, which includes the mistakes we make and the destruction we bring to other countries.
I really like the points you made.
I think that is a big problem today, we are only fed a sliver of the information available to grasp these topics so we never talk about them.
It truly opened my eyes to Afghanistan that I thought I would never get to see.
I thought it was much more uncivilized and more of a dessert war zone.
That is the part that I find to be so crazy.
How much different their everyday life is than what I had thought it was.
I have never been off of the continent, but I have been to a few countries and their cultures are so diverse.
I think many of us take this concept of reading or hearing what we want into our everyday lives also.
I just instantly thought of so many people that could definitely benefit from listening to this lecture.
I just thought they needed to hear this the most.
They cannot let a book that was written so long ago, rule their lives in my opinion, especially not mine.
When it comes to other things though, like let us say the topic of gay marriage or abortion, my parents have a lot to say about that.
If we are going to let a book control our lives, then do not be hypocritical.
Nothing makes me more upset than those who want to preach their religion to me, but do not even follow it completely themselves.
When people go about religion this way, it makes me very confused.
I do not want to deny the idea of a God though, which is why I just consider myself agnostic.
My grandmother and my grandfather met each other in the church, and my granddad was an asshole to everyone in the house apparently (he wasnt like that around the time I was born), but my grandmother put up with a lot of shit because they both believed that they should never get a divorce (theyre Baptist Christians).
Its weird to think about how much power it holds in people's lives sometimes.
But then again, they also didnt know each other very well I think (which was also a pretty popular practice back then).
The way Afghanistan is portrayed in America is a very poor country full of Muslim extremists.
They heard the same response we get when we try to bring up the problems and got to see how frustrating it can be.
To judge someone based solely off of one action in their lifetime forces people to live life with constant fear of consequences.
Personally, when I think of Afghanistan, I just relate it to war, fighting, negativity, and things like that.
It did a lot of things for me; it made me realize how lucky we are to be living in a mostly safe country, it made me realize how nave I was being when thinking of Afghanistan in that sense, and it made me sad that all Rafi kept saying was how important peace and brotherhood is and we need to have more of it in the world.
Therefore they had to start a proxy war with the Soviet Union, in which the CIA supported afghan rebels against the Soviet Union, these afghan rebels were called the Mujahedeen.
Today the Mujahedeen are known as the Taliban, and they are fighting the United States even though originally they were at the same side fighting against the Red scare of the Soviet Unions communism.
I think that interracial dating has been able to allow people to experience other cultures and learn about other races and break down stereotypes that surround some cultures.
The reality of Sharia law is that it is based on a book that promotes peace, which is actually quite similar to that of Christianity.
However, people interpret the story differently which means people will live life different ways.
It is true that Quran is the guideline that teaches people to live in this world.
However, it is impossible to fully understand it because it is so tiny that agreement and disagreement can definitely occur.
Still, you can never fully say that Sharia is the definite meaning that Quran wants us to understand.
I feel that in the end we have to respect Sharia law because Quran was interpreted in that way and some people agree to live life like that.
No matter how many meaning people understand from Quran, in the end we have to respect the majority of peoples thought.
I found it interesting when in this rant he said that there is a school of thought in which people look to the Bible and quaran to answer questions and instead of fact, they are left with interpretations.
Thats the exact same thing that people do with the torah on a daily basis.
As a mulatto person (black and white), no, it does not concern me that people are marrying other races.
When I was growing up, I never thought about the fact that my parents were different races.
And when I look at other interracial couples, I don't think much of it.
The video I chose is Christian Sharia in America because it discussed some things that I feel very strongly about.
I developed my relationship with God by praying, reading the Bible, and trying to live my life according to His teachings in the Bible.
Although I have my own beliefs, I am not one to judge those that do not agree with me.
Today, the Bible is available in many different versions to accommodate the preferences of many people.
In my KJV of the Bible, these 2 verses sound EXTREMELY similar, but it comes across in a way that I feel is less harsh.
It is unfortunate that we have not yet been able to get completely over our past issues involving this topic.
To think that there will be a twenty percent difference in salary increase between the two races in dissapointing.
Its because we are not directly affected by the issue, that we often tend to generalize the issue or look the other way.
Having to go on with his daily life to live and support his family, Rafi is such a great example of those innocent individuals that are simply trying to live in the midst of the war.
I can definitely agree with everything you just said, but to add on top of what you just said, I believe that interaction with people from all different cultures is so essential to understanding the world.
I was also raised Christian.
My father, however, was not very religious and today considers himself an atheist.
Therefore, I am glad that we have religious freedom to allow us to uphold our beliefs because it enables us to keep our morals aligned with our faith.
The more people that become aware of what is going on, the more help we can give.
A life in which they dont have to worry about a bomb destroying their house.
I really liked hearing about why her hair was the way it was.
I just thought that was the kind of hair that particular race shared and their genes.
He said the hair protects peoples head from the sun so it doesnt burn their head.
A question I didnt think of at the time was there are fair skinned people in south Africa with straight hair.
I've honestly never really thought of it as a normal city with typical every day families and people who are just trying to live their lives peacefully.
They only ever talk about the tragic and horrible things that are going on and portray the whole country as being one evil and violent nation.
Religions aren't umbrella terms under which everyone holds faith in the same way, and actions of radical individuals are no representation of other individuals who share their same religion.
Take this example: Would you think their would be the same amount of racism and mistreatment throughout the different ethnic groups if people actually understand and comprehend more the other cultures?
I also agree with you with the fact that cultural ignorance creates a barrier throughout the different ethnic groups.
I feel that at the end of the day, you have to use your own judgment to say whether something is right or wrong.
But I feel that if you interpret every part of the Bible so literally, it just doesn't really work well.
You mention the audience question to Bazzim asking if he is angry about what had happened.
I completely agree with what you wrote.
As a fellow Christian that is how I live my life since some of things written in the bible I do not agree with.
Its brings us to really appreciate the way that I feel most of the people in our generation look at religion.
That's not what this country was founded on.
From the time that the US occupied Afghanistan, weve been bombarded with pictures of active combat zones and men in camouflage covered in dust in the middle of dry-looking land.
Its strange to think what a skewed vision we have of what the word war really means.
I think that is what stuck with me the most.
Personally, I used to think about the war in Afghanistan a lot.
When we first deployed troops to the middle east to Obama's plan to get our troops back, I have always tried to stay up to date with the United States issues around the world.
This is selfish to say but unfortunately true, when Obama pulled our troops from the Middle East I began losing interest in the war.
I have never experienced any type of comparison to war.
The picture of the traffic jam and Sam talking about the emotions that they experience are just the same as ours.
In this post Ill be reacting to the Radicalizing The Bible video from SOC 119.
When a terrorist attack occurs they almost always mention that the person was Muslim and that sticks to the viewers mind.
My response for this week is about the recent exercise we did in class where we had white people and black people switch roles.
However, to find out that his duties consisted mostly of drinking tea with the enemy was quite shocking.
In particular, I liked your statement of how soldiers are people at the end of the day instead of these killing machine robots that society tends to categorize as.
I never really thought about the perspective of the people that have to live through war every single day of their lives.
Another interesting thing you brought up is about how Sam said that when we think of war, there is just a general idea of fighting that comes up in our mind.
I completely agree with that statement he made in class.
My heart feels heavy just thinking about how Basim went through something like that but in the end he chose love over hate.
Hearing Rafi describe his life there and seeing pictures of his family really gave me a better understanding on what the vast majority of the country is like.
Being able to free those people from the fear they face every day should be a main priority in the amount of time weve been over there.
Religion is changing vastly across the nation and we are seeing many more people joining our family that do not believe in christianity.
This means radically changing our laws to those that are fitting with the bible.
Sam pointed out that if we do adopt a Christian Sharia for our country we will be affectively pushing out country back into the past about 150 years.
I agree that it was nice to hear a different perspective on war.
I do not want to deny the idea of a God, but when I see so many people preach this and that, but do not really follow everything their holy book tells them to, it leaves me confused.
It disquiets me too, the amount of faith we're able to put in others to guide our own faith.
We seek short cuts and convenience in every aspect of our lives, even in relationships as special as the one many of us hold with ahigherpower.
Sharia law really stops people from the way they want to live.
I absolutely love the way you explained your interpretation of the Bible and your entire response.
I also did a response on this video and I mentioned how important it is for us to stop passing judgment on the sins of others.
Also, I believe this judgment that some Christians pass could stem from the version of Bible they read.
Obviously that would be extremely hard to enforce, but that is where it has to start.
It brought up an interesting thought while I was in the lecture.
How has our society turned into killing our own kind and destroying lives that are harmless?
Just because we see attacks against us Americans, doesn't mean there aren't other Christians behaving the same and using their justification as religion as well.
It is extremely difficult to put my selves in their shoes without interacting and understanding what their lives are truly like.
Hearing from LTC Richard Garey was an eye-opening experience, because he mentioned how rare combat was compared to how common many civilians think it is.
I thought this just went to show how off the American publics perception of not only the Afghani people, but also the American soldiers is.
If we really cared to look into how the war has affected the innocent lives over there who just want their family to be safe, I do not think any single person would be in support of continuing war.
This is the problem when we discuss religion and people of religious faiths other than our own.
Being able to sit back and actually study the religion to understand it, is what needs to be done.
The fear built from the religious wars cause us to look at the extremist Islamic people and apply that to every person from the religion.
Obviously, this is an issue because not every person of Islamic faith is an extremist.
He then gives examples of what those words mean in todays terms.
And whenever this is brought up I instantly think of how much better the world would be without religion.
Some topics people will agree with and some topics people won't agree with.
However, history has contradicted those views.
Understanding an entire country's way of life and seeing how different it can be from ours is something that is difficult for many people to grasp.
While I'm not proud to admit, I find it to be a common thread with my peers.
The Quran similar to the Bible was written a very long time ago and can be interpreted in many different ways.
Even though these are two completely different religions who have fought wars with each other over their differences, they still have so many similarities in their religions.
There has been a fear of muslims that has been going around the United States.
Not once have I had a class that discussed the topic of racism.
This is probably due to the board of education believing that it is not an issue in the community because it is primarily composed of all Whites.
Digging into the psychological roots of why racism is not talked about much, especially in our education system, I believe is that people never want to talk about something that they are ashamed about.
However, the topic isnt ever brought up because of their pride.
This kind of street-level oppression might seem like history to someone in the U.S. (assuming you also count the more recent 1960s as just history as well), but a similar kind of domestic terror is exactly what is happening to places like Afghanistan, and its important to make that connection to improve one's understanding and empathy.
Also, violent attacks are not written in the bible they are wrongfully interpreted.
The brief point of my response to the response is, religion is something that people need to grow to an understanding.
The terrorism and crusades that go on in our world are key to how the people move and perceive religion.
Every time I interact with people from other cultures, I am amazed by the different things we do.
If I saw a foreign soldier on my property, I would instantly think that they are here to cause me harm.
It was powerful to hear that 99% of the interactions that military personnel have with civilians in war zones is peaceful.
I always thought they were more of a nuisance.
Knowing the level of communication that is involved between civilians and soldiers makes me realize the necessity of learning cultural cues.
This was a huge cultural development which greatly helped soldiers in Afghanistan.
For example, my family is from Puerto Rico and they mainly only have Puerto Ricans that live on the island.
Sam brings up a point that is very interesting here.
This is why this specific activity was so interesting.
You discuss and think about things that youd never typically talk or think about in your everyday life.
This is a great response to this video, but however, in most cases the Sharia law in lots of middle eastern governments is imposed by radicals who have taken power, and therefore many places do not accept gay marriage, and punish it severely.
Taking away of their religion was a case where the removalof religion had destroyed a society and a culture of peace and justice.
It really is great knowing that they are so open to talk about their life stories.
After watching this video, some of the points were really interesting and I had a lot question in about it.
Its something that we can take pieces from and apply to our lives.
This sounds completely obvious but only when you fully put yourself in the shoes of a person like Ahmed Rafi, who has two young daughters with dreams and aspirations.
I agree with you that, when you really strip them down, Christianity and Islam do not seem fundamentally very different.
I completely agree with you on how I have never viewed the two religions so similarly.
It is happening in our own country now where different religions are creating bias towards certain groups.
That is why they are still able to maintain their straight hair despite living in a climate which typically would have people evolve with more curly or kinky hair.
And, whats more important, these customs and the Bibles teachings can be interpreted in different ways.
Yes, the Taliban and ISIS are extreme groups that follow the Quran word for word, punishing those who dont do the same.
While, it may contain some law set to guide few people, it could not be considered for everybody.
Since, everyone in the world does not have the same ideology, beliefs or culture.
Sam, also, said about how different people interpret the Quran to bring a solution to unsolvable situation.
These disagreements had been created because the Sharia law has some things missing for it to be considered for the whole world.
I cant imagine just inviting someone in my home so casually.
My family also pack tons of American souvenirs and products to give away.
The Bible was written centuries ago which means that what it says probably isnt very accurate.
Within the Bible there are the 10 Commandments, which are the laws that should be followed in order to not commit sin.
This is a perfect example of how we can still follow the ideas of the Bible but the actual laws stated in it arent needed to be followed strictly.
I love how people who have visited Afghanistan say they are the most welcoming and genuine people.
There are some major issues we face in society being women (and men) and it needs to be discussed.
Just food for thought - but looking forward to seeing what Sam has in class next!
A man who looked at a woman besides his wife would automatically be an adulterer.
Homosexuals would probably be forced out of society.
A literal interpretation would alter what we consider to be a Christian.
Today, there are many verses we fully disregard in our society, such as those aforementioned.
Few modern Christians follow the Bible verbatim, and those that do could be marked as terrorists.
However, there are people that generalize Muslims in this way.
Then I thought that it goes that way there, and hardly anything can be done.
But when I started to see the slides of real people and listen to Mr. Rafi, I had many other thoughts through my mind.
Mr. Rafi, a lawyer, can't lead a normal and simple life.
In this video, Sam is talking about how broad both of these books are and how differently they can both be interpreted.
One of the biggest arguments that The Bible raises is whether or not God approves of gays.
Sam made it clear to me that The Quran is the same way, it is entirely up to the person reading it to find their own meaning amongst the words.
Your response was spot on what I was thinking.
I didnt get a chance to talk about this in my discussion group, but I totally agree with everything youre saying.
For example, the Quaran was written and takes place during a time of war, so many references are relating to violence and fighting.
I know i was raised catholic but have been to several other churches that were not Catholic as well as attending many services in Synagogue with my Jewish friends.
When both speakers came up in front of the class and explained their perspective on who the Afghan people are, I was thrilled to hear what they had to say.
It is very unsettling knowing that there are people who have to live under the circumstances that normal Afghan civilians do.
Taking this course has definitely opened my eyes in many different ways, especially in regards to how unaware we are.
I now know the importance of learning about people from different places, with different cultures, and seeing things from their perspective.
I have chosen to talk about the clip What The Quran Says About Divorce.
I do not know much about Afghanistan at all, so I quickly assumed that women barely had any rights in their country.
I am still waiting on the first woman president though.
This is why Dr. Richards first statement made me believe in it.
I never realized how extremely seriously people took the Bible and the fact that they believed they should live through what it says.
Since I grew up Catholic, I am technically a Christian.
However, the older I got the more I questioned and practiced my faith less.
However, the Bible does not support many of these reasons.
The Bible says things along the lines of women were created to be the helper for men, but luckily that is not exactly how it is currently going for women as they are fighting to increase our rights.
I agree with your thoughts on this video of how eye opening it is that so many people are hospitable and generous.
Since I feel the America is so unlike this, it is shocking that these people can be so welcoming to anyone, even strangers.
While it would be hard to make it one and most likely not work, at least for a long time, I think it would be something nice to try moving forwards just as Sam says they do now.
When reading your response I thought back to my religion.
Just like you, the older I got the less I practiced my faith and beliefs.
I feel totally horrible but there are just some things I do not agree with my religion.
Many of these people who do believe this are Christians, but in reality, the same thing is happening with Christianity.
Now if no one said how to live, the world may have been more chaotic.
Rules that we cannot see with out eye.
If you look deep into atoms you will find that we are basically a bunch of hydrogen.
Everything is our society is being ruled by sciences way of interacting energy and if we choose to ignore it we will fight each other on our books of our ancestors.
We have no idea who made up our rules that govern our nature.
By someones interpretation of the Quran that could be considered stealing and may result in someones hand being amputated as punishment.
Interpretations of anything are very important because it allows people to explore and debate different ideas.
In my opinion, having different interpretations is a good thing.
Without being able to interpret the Constitution, it would be difficult for us to apply the Constitution to todays social issues.
Growing up I was taught that people didnt get divorced and the only way people were to be separated was through an annulment which meant something in the relationship was very, very wrong.
I often wonder about how people can say doing something one way versus another way is allowed.
Those people, whether they are Jewish or Muslim, are allowed to believe what they chose, and believing in something comes along with actions.
So, as a result, they judge, critique, and compare to their own traditions and beliefs.
But what Sams lecture taught me is that who are we to do all of those things?
Those people, whether its my new Muslim neighbor, or my Jewish roommate, are doing the exact same thing, interpreting something and choosing to believe in it.
That is what I am doing with the Bible, so why cant they do the same with the Quran?
Although many argue against it the bible is very much so interoperable.
I think we should all just be more open minded when it comes to interpreting things like this.
I was raised Jewish, but I no longer follow any religion.
I also agree that we need to start being more understanding and accepting, instead of remaining ignorant to one another.
Yes the world was changing, but to them, the book had to stay the same, no matter what shit it has in it.
One person might firmly believe that taking a random paperclip is stealing yet another person might think the opposite.
Also, the world has evolved tremendously since the Quran, Bible, and other religious books.
Also, how would such actions be accounted for?
The government would not be able to know if you committed premarital sex.
Marissa, I completely agree and feel the same way about what you are saying.
Sometimes all we need is to take a step back and gain a different perspective.
When my cousins had their bar mitzvahs, bat mitzvahs, and communions, I sat respectfully in the crowd and wondered how such a monumental part of someones life could be based off a single piece of writing.
It is comforting to know that generations are moving away from literal interpretations of the bible that could offend or hurt others.
In summary, I believe in todays modern society, people shouldnt live their lives solely based on religious writings.
Christians living in America are going to interpret it way differently then people living across the globe.
Instead, it should be a guide to how you can live the best life you could possibly live.
There were a lot of things that I ignorantly thought and judged about Islam as a whole before even being introduced to it.
If youre not familiar with Abrahamic religions, Islam is one of them.
Many of the nicest people that I met in the Middle East were Muslims.
For example, the Bible calls for the death penalty for people who commit these crimes: cursing a parent, disobeying a parent, adultery, homosexuality and a woman losing her virginity before marriage.
I had only thought that they both basically have the same God and had not considered the similarities in ethical codes and ideals.
As Americans, we take any violence mentioned in the Quran, and immediately conclude that is the reason why Islamists are radical and violent people.
Before this class, I really never gave any thought to just how wrong our views on other religions could be, because honestly, before this I actually did believe that all Muslims prayed five times a day.
This gives us a general sense on how to live our lives which is very important and essential.
I also have seen family such as my own struggle financially and mentally, but church always seemed like a place to relax the mind and find peace.
There are constantly arguments with those who are Christian about disagreements on how to interpret the bible.
This is all subject to interpretation in the same way that the Quran is.
Sam explained how the Bible and the Quran are similar in many ways, and the idea of using a bible is the same in the Muslim societies toward the Quran.
I love how Sam compares excerpts from the Quran and the Bible alike because people don't realize how similar the two religions are.
Hence, Christians will only focus on the religious standpoint of the Bible and disclaim anything that has a negative connotation.
It really shows the negative stereotypes and how uneducated people are about religion and the Middle East itself.
I have many friends who are Muslim and they treat you like family every day, in America there's this constant fear-mongering and people are misinformed about the truth behind religion.
But, I think that put the overall topic of Sharia Law and the Quran into perspective.
I also agree with you in saying the role that the Quran should have in society regarding Sharia Law.
As a guiding principle, it works, but as a legal system, I do not necessarily see it.
As unreligious person, I cant imagine saying that Im a part of a group with people who are on the other side of the word committing massacres.
I have never explored another religion or have been influenced by someone in another religion.
When in reality, the people who are saying this have probably never explored other countries or gotten a different perspective from someone from a different country.
For example, is there something that mentions how to deal with online bullying or harassment.
Thus, it would make it hard to come to a common agreement on how to treat each specific situation.
It is a book that is not very long, and can not address every possible situation that can occur in society today.
There are, indeed, some interesting rules associated with the Sharia law about the divorce.
Based on the statements that Sam put on the board during this discussion, I would not be very likely to be entering heaven, and pretty much all of the people I spend time with would not be either.
That is not to say we aren't good people, it's just the way we live life.
I would not consider myself a religious person, but I do value some of the things that the Bible says.
However, in my place, it's hard to apologize on the behalf of history and the whole entire white community.
Sam opened this discussion with the myth that in Islam men can divorce their wives without any reason and Ravi showed this was not the case.
In the conclusion of the video Sam draws attention to the fact that many of our political leaders paint Islam to be a religion that follows antiquated rules but after this class, I can now see how similar our laws are to each other.
Some things got lost in translation.
I just think if we done the life by the bible more of my rights will be taken away.
Once in my life I have read the king James Version of the Bible in one year?
Then there are those people who call themselves but are not really Christian.
When reading the bible what version or translation of the Bible is actually true?
I do not know if that makes a difference or not.
So living by the Bible can is hard and should not be done at all.
Again, there are some things that are outdated and really old that does not fit into what the world is today.
So why do we put so much faith into the Bible if we only selectively choose what to follow?
Dont get me wrong, the Bible or the Quran are certainly places for some amount of guidance, but should not be where 100% of someones dependence lies.
The topic of divorce in Islam is very controversial due to the fact that a man can basically instantly divorce his wife by repeating the word talaq three times.
I think that even if the men and women have the same laws, they should both have to go through some formal process to divorce.
I agree wholeheartedly with your statement that the information that is fed to us affects our view of Afghanistan so much.
However, I can now see that this is not even close to accurate.
I thought that this class was really powerful, as it broke down the walls of ignorance and misinformation that divide us.
It is sad to see Islam stereotyped in many western societies.
The issue of race that weve learned about, so far, is very similar to the issue of religion in the world: There are slight differences that cause such great issues to people.
If they could only see past the minute differences and, instead, relate to each other, there would be a lot more peace in the world.
Christianity is just so insane to me, I can not just say Christianity because as we learned in class this day Muslim religion is practically saying the same thing.
This class was just proof to how far out the bible versus are and how many people would actually be going to heaven if heaven was real.
If that is the percentage just in our classroom, then I cannot imagine what it is within society.
I do not want to upset anyone or how they feel because I think religion is a wonderful thing and has so much meaning spiritually.
Another thing that is crazy to me is how much Americans are ignorant to Muslim religion.
Everyone is so bias as well because Christian have the same thing going on with the certain people that change what the bible says and how to act.
People who argue that the Christian faith should be first and foremost in the administration of this county need a serious reality check because running a nation based on a religion has failed throughout history.
In my opinion , people in power will use religion as a way to control the larger population if there is no separation of church and state.
If religion is blended into government, it will be one of the greatest attacks on American liberties ever experienced.
This information may be otherwise censored by mass media or just thrown the back burner because it does not fit with the views or goals of modern news networks.
Especially when you explained that you are someone that looks at there own religion but does not take time to see another person's religious views.
I think that there are so many that do this in the world.
Everyone who thinks like this has just not explored the world and the possibilities they have.
If he didn't talk about how the Afghan people weren't bad, then I would have never believed two of my cousins who served over there a couple years ago.
They also said some positive stuff, such as how the families hosted dinner for the soldiers as well as giving them water, towels, etc.
I think the media plays a big role in that as well, because you always see news stories about soldiers being killed over there or bombings happening.
What you don't see is what those two videos showed we had to watch for the quiz.
Listening to Rafi made me think a lot more from a personal side.
As Sam said in the video, most people think sharia law is backward, and sometimes even wrong.
And because of sharia law is based on The Quran, people would just assume that is Islam taught these Islamic people about these backward laws and orders.
The Quran contains fables that teach people about good morals.
Most of the time, people tend to use religious texts to support their acts to justify their wrongdoings.
But there are also individuals who use religion to achieve their personal desire.
Henry VIII, for example, initiate the English Reformation, and separated the Church of England from papal authority, which was an effort to have an annulment with his first wife, Catherine of Aragon.
It all comes back to the point that we should not stereotype a religion because of what we heard about it.
I am assuming this is why religion cannot be brought back into schools.
I still see public officials bringing religion into their points though.
Its ethically and morally wrong to have a bible based world because not everyone believes in the same things.
It also breaks my heart to see the religious freedom bills from various states that go against same sex couples.
The one from Georgia that Sam read to us really shocked me.
Essentially it says that religious priests can deny a couple just because they dont follow their same religious beliefs.
Also, Christian sharia can deny you from employment just because your religious beliefs don't align with the companys.
I hope that more people can get educated on Sharia Law and the Establishment Clause so one day we won't have to worry about stuff like this.
However, the Quran does recognize that separation is a possibility between a husband and wife.
I think people, myself included, may have had an idea that in Islam the man holds all the power.
I find the concept that when a woman does want a divorce, she is not guaranteed it to be wrong.
This is what is wrong with the world.
It is sad to see that there are people who use religion to achieve their personal desire.
I feel like that is a common occurrence back when.
For example, President Trump uses specific words and connotations when talking about Islam or Mexicans that creates fear and uncertainty in the eyes of the American people.
As citizens we all must be aware of these potential threats against our liberties and be able to realize when someone is fabricating an enemy through fear and uncertainty to control us.
I went to a Catholic high school, so I have been told for four years that the Bible is where we base our moral knowledge off of.
When Sam started bringing up different situations that were obviously unable to be answered using the Bible or the Quran alone, I felt puzzled.
However, I do believe that we can use the stories and lessons from the Bible to infer what we should do in these specific situations that we cant find in the Bible.
And I do think that Sam refers to this exact idea at the end of the video when he says, Sharia law, what is it is taking this book and saying, look, its filled with a lot of stories.
Both Christians and Muslims have interpreted their books in a way that has led them to engage in violence and destruction.
Why do we neglect to talk about this as much as we do when it comes to Sharia law?
Both the Quran and the Bible are subject to peoples OWN interpretation of what is written inside them.
Specifically, seeing the images of Rafi and his young children sparked emotions of sadness within me.
I think this is because these pictures really helped me to make connections to aspects of my own life.
It is upsetting to imagine the childhood that some children in Afghanistan are forced to have due to this war.
In my opinion, I have never really been able to make real connections with war because I feel as if I am so distant from all of the actual violence.
War affects everyone, but when the actual violence is taking place in your country, the regular civilians can be affected just as much as the people fighting in the wars.
In one of the audio recordings suggested for the first quiz in this class, the speaker, Al Letson, repeated the notion that Trump continually denies the issue of white and Christian extremism in America.
However, as shown by the classes responses to the claims of the Bible, few people follow the text so strictly.
One can assume that many students in the lecture identify as Christians, yet the standards set out by the Bible were still seemingly absurd to them based on their collective reactions.
Sam is right when he says it is real and involves real people.
Their reality is not knowing if they will die when they step out of their houses.
I hope to make myself more aware of what is happening in places like this.
I hope to educate myself so that I can spread the word and help others be more aware.
War is not just this thing that is out there, it is real.
How can people who do such good work end up dead fighting in a war?
I don't think anyone can really follow word for word what the Bible and Quran are telling people to do because beliefs are too different now for rules in the Bible and Quran to try and interpret the sacred books.
I also think that most religions are all saying the same.
When I think of the fact that Afghanistan is more progressive than us it really makes me think.
The United States always tends to feel they are the best but instead we are actually moving backwards.
I totally agree with people wanting to express their religion but there comes a point where it is just too far.
Another thing within the video that struck me was the laws that Georgia is passing.
This shows that the United States is in fact moving backwards rather than moving forward with time and that is something that needs to be talked about.
If people really want to follow the books in that way, then they can't pick and choose the topics that are going to be more wrong then others.
The books say gay marriage is illegal but they also so many other things, like the examples Sam put on the board.
However no one is ever making a big deal about any of those issues.
He has almost become accustomed to the life he lives.
Basically the fact that his life is a waiting game.
He continues to put his life on the line every day.
He even mentioned that his wife did not want to continue this.
This is not something that we in the United States are so used to.
There is bad happening all around us even when we do not know it.
Through my personal observations, the media likes to paint groups in stark contrasting ways.
Then I start thinking about the point of this class and I begin to think that just because we may have something that works here, doesn't mean we should take it upon ourselves to change how everyone else in the world acts.
Now looking back, I realize a certain pattern in the commentators I would listen to.
Most of the base agreed that both Christian and Muslim law could not solely run a government.
I have since learned from my mistakes.
I decided to look into it and found that, like Sam showed us in class, a lot of the hate groups in the Middle East form in some of the same way gangs do in America.
Young men that are down in their luck or born in poor situations are promised a future and power.
Furthermore, there are many cases of Christian Sharia that are working in the American government right now, which is ridiculous considering how hypocritical it is.
Too many want the Christian religion to be intertwined into life here in America but the very same are almost disgusted by the same thing happening with Islam in the Middle East.
At the end of the day the establishment clause was created to keep this very thing from happening and ensuring that no religion took precedence over another (even though Christianity has always remained the most favorable).
In what world is discrimination justifiable in this instance compared to when it was based off of the color of ones skin for example?
You make a relevant point and I think I did not initially think this way because I have a different background that can limit me from thinking from different perspectives.
Back to your point, I wonder how we can solve this issue: religions group people who believe different things.
The Sharia law uses the Quran to understand how to build a lifestyle.
I was trying to understand if it promoted a form of government, but from the class lecture I concluded that it didnt.
One thing that stuck out during the discussion is that we all have the ability to have our own religious beliefs.
A lot of people use religion as a way to guide their life and choices so its important to understand what motivates other people.
Its obvious that our class is full of diversity which proposes different opinions and beliefs.
Some of the reasons are torture and health which make sense but another one is that the husband cannot provide.
It is odd to think that one universal term such as marriage can be so similar yet so different.
I never really knew anything about divorce so I never knew that these laws existed but I think that waiting a certain amount of years is helpful to the relationship because they could work things out and eventually feel the need to not divorce.
Yet I was fully aware of the violence that was being committed by Muslims and others under the Taliban ISIS rule.
If the media wont make Christians look bad, theyll put it on another religious group like Islam, to prove that Americans and Christians in general are more superior and commit no crime.
I always thought the bible was the bible and it really only had one way to interpret it, but evidently not if groups like white supremacists and the alt right read a passage in the bible that says its acceptable to hate and kill others based on the color of their skin or what religion they practice.
Conversely, another Christian could read the same passage and interpret it as God wanting them to give back to their community in some way.
I personally think religion is important because it shapes peoples lifestyles and choices.
But I do think it is interesting how people of the same group can act differently.
Whether it is religion or a completely different topic, we will never get anyone to fully agree on everything.
I also like how you talked about how people turn to religion for good but yet it is the backbone behind many conflicts and disagreements.
Religion is a complex ideology because it becomes personal to the individuals lifestyle.
The video link you included was interesting because it tried to make sense of the conflict that arises because there are many different beliefs but can still be centered on the same concepts.
I dont think people should be generalized based on the group they are in from their religion.
Through the media, some religions become generalized as being bad based on the actions of an individual or small group of people.
Thats why I find it hard to believe in Sharia law.
But with these speakers who came to class, show us that not everyone is bad.
I also find it humbling that they are a very gift giving country.
That was one major thing that I wont forget.
It changed the world and still sixteen years later it is one, if not the biggest thing that has happened in the past two decades to affect the world.
Once we went to war after the attacks on the world trade centers all sorts of scary things happened.
I remember hearing about the attacks going on across the world because of how mad Americans were.
After this class I really started to wonder why everyone thought it was alright to do this.
In class I really started to understand why Sam was so angry and frustrated.
But all because we went to war right away many innocent people were killed.
I also think that there needs to be more conversation going on.
The things you read in the Bible, or other religious literatures should be taken with a grain of salt.
An example of what I try to follow is the Ten Commandments.
Those who do could find themselves jailed.
Hardship of the variety that he described is so far removed from what we are accustomed to in our modern American society.
I could have been born to different parents and have a completely different reality as well, one closer to what he has experienced.
Basims life story reminds me again why wars should not be fought, at least not how they are fought now.
Everyone grows up with some sort of beliefs and that is usually what they go by as they get older.
That is why this class and discussion is important because it broadens our minds to think outside the box and really question those things we have grown up to live by.
My only input is that not everyone is perfect and as humans we are going to make mistakes and go against things from what the Bible says at some point.
That is something I question about the Bible.
Back in the day everything that the Bible says was way more enforced than it is now.
What I believe the Bible says is not the same as what someone else might believe.
I think that is why so many people may feel uncomfortable with talking about it as well.
Im not really sure where someone reads in the bible that they should kill people who arent like them.
I found it very interesting that Muslims and Christians do not have completely different beliefs.
It actually makes me really happy that they are similar religions because I think when more people learn that, it could really bind them together and also maybe give people more of an understanding of the radicalization of their religions.
There is this strange divide between Christians and Muslims that is really misunderstood, in my opinion.
I feel the same way that you do.
I found it really interesting that we had such similar ways of living because I never thought we did.
That is mainly because I only ever saw the bad things happening and I never thought that we could be so similar.
I also think that it was really nice to have Ravi come in our class and help us to understand what exactly life is like in Afghanistan and how their religion and things in their ever day life work.
However, until this part of the lecture in class I never thought about the bible in the way Sam way conveying.
I always had this thought of well its the bible and it is about God and Jesus so whatever is in it must be true and correct and what I am supposed to follow.
I understand now after multiple lectures that I can open up and it is better to talk about issues.
I still consider myself a Catholic but I fail to make it to mass every week.
It is so hard to take the bible word for word and I like the examples that you have laid out.
I have done many things that the bible condemns but I dont think that makes me a bad person.
I still have my faith and attend mass as often as I am able but if I were to take the bible word for word I would be a horrible person, according to some of its writings.
I found this especially interesting because I have often wondered how to categorize the extreme Christian organizations.
They are essentially attempting to implement the exact same thing but because of a different book.
I think tha Americans see these groups differently because of the moral that our country was founded on .
Well we had a war on terrorism, but where were we fighting abroad in the Middle East.
For example, I was never taught about how European settlers acted like the Americas were uninhabited when they discovered them.
It makes my blood boil when people talk about slavery as just history because think about it would it really be that easy for you to not draw connections between then and now if your history was that gruesome and relevant to your day to day life?
Its definitely not a one-and-done situation in which we commit one sin or receive one blowjob and just like that, we cant get through the gates in heaven.
The Quran is a book of teachings that are meant to explain how people should live their lives.
The two sound extremely similar and as long as no one is forcing their beliefs teachings on anyone than there should be no judgement.
Basically everyone has done something in their particular holy book that is wrong so by those means everyone is going to hell.
The judgement comes from those who speak without having knowledge on religions other than their own.
If everyone was aware that these two different religions are ultimately created by two extremely similar books, then I think a lot of peoples opinions would be changed.
Being able to seethat the points Sam made between both books were so similar to one another really makes you question the point of having conflict between different religions in the first place.
It is an excellent novel but are clearly not representative of at least a majority of Afghan marriages and divorces.
This is the second week in a row now that Ive really been shocked about how similar Islam culture and American culture are to each other.
There are only the four reasons why she can say she desires a separation: torture, the man being unable to have sex, the man being unable to provide financially, and the man simply leaving his wife without explanation.
The dynamic in the United States is different in that the divorce rate goes up almost every year, and about 50% of all marriages end in divorce; where both genders have the same rights in deciding to go through with a separation.
In some senses the United States Law is more backwards and has more loopholes than we wish it to be.
We live in a completely different world than the time period where it was written.
1st century Christianity is still present in a 21st century world, filled with tens of different religions and beliefs being expressed in just the United States.
This class has enlightened me in seeing different perspectives, and I can relate in your feelings about what the class is bringing you mentally and emotionally.
Sam's points in this video were actually so true and he made us see Christianity in a point of view thatI've never thought about before.
It's not that we are selectively religious but some people do consider themselves strict with their religion but they are only strict in certain aspects.
That was what I was always taught and thats how I interpreted the Bible.
This is all because that is how they interpreted the readings.
I personally think the picture with people sitting around praying and reading is the correct way to practice it.
Now Ive come to learn that unless Jesus comes back and tells us the right way, we are constantly going to be in disagreement.
At first, this concept was very hard for me to understand because I was raised being taught that it was clear which way to act.
Thats why I really enjoyed this lecture because it showed me how the other side thinks and is able to justify their way of thinking.
Thats why I feel like there should be no arguments surrounding this because it all deals with personal preference.
However, society is continually growing and changing to fit different norms of this world.
Many people may agree or even disagree with me, however that is the way it is meant to be because it is all about interpretation.
However, the same passage has the power to confuse someone.
For example, the Bible says people cannot be gay, does that mean anyone who is gay will go to hell?
I honestly do not think so, but really who knows?
It is how you interpret these books that dictates how you behave.
Some Christians take the bible word for word and believe that anyone who is gay or gets divorced will not get into heaven, but some interpret it more loosely and dont necessarily believe that.
But it is unfair to the whole group when their reputation is determined by only a portion of the group.
When you think about it as if it were happening to you, you realize how incredibly terrible it is.
It really clicked for me when Sam showed us the pictures of Mosul.
I also think we need to make more people realize the terrible things happening to the civilians in the Middle East,there is not enough awareness of what those people are going through on a daily basis.
And even with all of these common factors pointed out, there will inevitably be people who deny this and become angry.
I do believe that killing innocent civilians who had nothing to do with 9 11 was horrible.
These people living in Afghanistan are not all bad, and its something that a lot of Americans need to understand and come to terms with.
The only times I find there to be issues with people attempting to live out the Bible 100 percent is when very, very old terms and standards come into play.
I believe that the general motive and ethics behind the Bible and Gods word is what needs to be lived out and, actually, without much interpretation.
Clearly not all Muslims are terrorists, in the same way that not all Christians are supremacists.
In all honestly, I really have not since I was little and it almost is like it did not matter because it was not directly affecting me.
He is a parent so obviously, he had to worry about his daughters.
I also really cannot imagine what it was like to have his best friend murdered.
I think it is really cool how Sam brings in these special guests to share their stories because it makes everything so much more impactful.
I also just appreciate these special guests for taking time out of their day to talk to us because I do not think they know how impactful they can be.
Arianna, the things that youve mentioned actually sound rather similar to my reply on this thread, so Im thankful that we share two different viewpoints that are very much identical.
I found this lecture very interesting because the only thing I really grew up knowing was also the Bible.
I would like to learn more about every religion because it is interesting to me.
I do not think it is fair how we judge people just from what we hear.
I went to church when I was younger and I got baptized and confirmed.
He also says to imagine using the Quran to adjudicate any legal situation.
I remembered at the beginning of the video he said that the Quran and New Testament are very similar.
Sam mentioned The Georgia Bill at the end saying that its legal for a religious leader to deny performing a marriage ceremony for someone conflicting with their beliefs.
The second law about faith based organizations not having to offer social, educational, or charitable services to people who are in opposition to their world view is straight inhumane.
I find this devastating that it is actually coming from somewhere in America.
I'm sure plenty of people are aware of it but the same amount, if not more, are unaware of it or ignore it.
Sharia law prevents people from believing what they want unless they support the version of Sharia ruling the nation.
The states that have passed Religious Freedom Bills should abolish them at once.
Though the majority of the students at my high school were Catholic, not all of us agreed with every aspect of Catholicism, including the teachers.
Religion is interpreted so literally, but so differently by so many people.
It blows my mind that two individuals can dislike each other because of how they interpret a religion.
It can be understood and utilized an infinite amount of ways, but why does that matter?
Religion was never meant to be a divisive tool, rather something to bring structure and serve as a moral compass.
I think our responses are pretty similar because I also mentioned the people of the United States freedom isnt based on a rule book.
Yet people still attempt to do exactly this.
It seems that this form of governing creates more issues than it solves because some people will interpret the scriptures differently than others and have arguments about who is correct.
It also discriminates against other religions by forcing them to obey laws of one religion.
This may just be because I am not very educated when it comes to different religions but I am pleased to know that women have the same rights as men.
I also learned that when divorce occurs in Afghanistan, it is very similar to what happens when people get divorced the U.S.
I find this very interesting because I highly doubt this is practiced in America.
I am curious to know if court is involved at all with divorce in Afghanistan because in America, courts are used in nearly ever divorce.
However after this lecture I began to think that the message african americans are trying to send is not that only black lives matter but that their lives do matter because in our society it can feel like this is not the case.
And I agree we always celebrated Columbus day but in high school only had a small chapter in history class that addressed the inhumane ways the native Americans were treated.
However I do believe that the founding of America was a positive turning point for the world.
It took way too long for blacks to be given the right to vote because they weren't considered a full human which is complete uncalled.
I had always picture the KKK as a relatively small group who did terrible things.
I use other sources of information to back up my opinions and that is what I believe most Christians should do because the person you debate against would not listen to your argument.
Turning the tables and making it so that the white people have the ancestors who were enslaved by black people forced people (at least me personally) to think about things in a different perspective.
I obviously was always aware of the issue of racism but never truly thought to put myself in other peoples shoes who were experiencing racism and discrimination simply because I have never experienced it myself.
These things sound so ridiculous when watching it in Sams exercise, but what is very alarming is the fact that these are real comments that have been made by white people toward black people getting targeted by police officers.
When seeing things in a different light, it made my mind really think and I have found myself yet again feeling guilty for not understanding how ignorant and rude so many white people are and wonder why this is a problem that has yet to go away.
If people were more educated and aware of how unfairly people were being treated, I believe there could be a difference in the way a lot of people think today.
Sam also says that the Quran and the New Testament are not that different, from a sociologists perspective.
Why do Americans oppress Muslims, if they too, believe that Jesus is a holy man?
The Quran is also a book of stories and teachings to help people understand how to live and succeed in life, just like the Bible.
Therefore, Sharia Law is based on the Quran and used as a general template for the justice system.
This is discrimination towards women because they are not receiving equal power as the men are getting.
To me, that is very strange because in our culture I feel like a lot of people just give up on their marriage and get a divorce without trying.
Also include the thought that male has more power in the society than women.
At where I come from which is China, there is still something about divorce that affect the female more than male, even now in this modern day.
But still there are still lots of female who are afraid to say divorce to their husband.
But that doesn't mean I followed every single one.
I believe the Bible is just a guide to life.
That is why I really think the Bible and Christianity is less strict than Islam and The Quran.
I believe Muslims are more devoted to their religion because first, there's ONE version.
Its hard to follow all the rules because sinning is an easy thing to do.
We say we can't do that, but end up doing it.
I believe it shows you examples on how to live a Christian life and make it to Heaven when My Savior is ready to come save us.
And also, I believe it teaches you not to do bad things and end up in Hell with Satan.
If I was to choose, I believe I would've been a muslim from birth because in my opinion, they are more devoted and serious about Islam.
Earlier in my life I was questioning that myself due to conversations with my mother.
She was really against any other religions and was very concerned if I talk to people with different religious background.
Is it a good thing or bad I guess we will find out when we pass away, because we all will die eventually, right Samuel Richards?
The only different thing is the leader we follow.
He comes back to describe the outside world to the mino, but the mino pictures everything and everyone with a fish body.
Sam talks about how we are fish because we have not left our waters and do not realize anything until a culture comes in and points something out to us.
We should not look at it as negative because it is how Christians would view the Old Testament.
But because we look different or may have different opinions on things, there is a separation between cultures.
If everyone looked past that, we may all live in a peaceful world without war.
If you remember Afghan people in 60s they most likely did not have strict laws.
As we can see people are trying to leave these countries which means forcing something against the will is not really working out.
I wouldve not listen to the advice from the bible that says if you were hit on the right side of your face turn your left side and let that person hit you, because God will save you later.
I also though that it was very interesting to hear Jesus mentioned in a book where he is not considered the son of god.
This chooses to neglect the parts of the Bible that were considered unsavory and for the most part, it wasn't until I left the church that I really learned about the negative parts of the Bible.
Thank you for bringing up the comparison between the Quran and the New Testament.
I believe that if we simply take the best of the teachings from both religious documents, the messages would likely be very similar.
I do not feel any sort of hatred toward the group, but I believe many of the generalizations that are tossed around.
For the most part, in America the husband and wife are both able to file for divorce.
There is obviously a process that it must go through before it is official and sometimes this process is messy and lengthy.
However, people still appreciate the shared power of men and women.
She can also choose to just leave, but would have to forfeit the money promised at marriage.
He has to pay for all of the wifes needs for 6 months and take care of all of the needs of the children for 16 18 years.
In America, I know there are divorce settlements, but these vary on a case to case basis.
In America, there is this view that Muslim women are completely oppressed, but in reality, it is not that way.
This is true when it comes to divorce, but in many other aspects of life as well.
He says that God wants you to read the Bible appropriately, but what is the appropriate way to read it?
However, I did some research and found some controversial bible passages.
But he would not hearken to her prayers, but being stronger overpowered her and lay with her [II Kings 13:14].
A way to get through tough days and a thought to hold onto.
Lastly, I just want to ask to those who are religious - why do you believe and what about your sins?
People I trust as friends who did that to me.
For awhile it was hard for me to believe in the Bible because of what happened to me.
I agree on everything you have written.
I liked that they were so connected to their religion and god that they wore a hijab every day.
The conversation between the white girls and the Muslim girls was extremely interesting to me because they asked most of the questions that I was thinking in my head.
I feel like western culture is very into looks and fashion and their appearance, but the hijab is a good way to avoid this.
Of course the girls want to look good, but thats not the only thing they care about.
I give the girls so much power for wearing the hijabs.
I had no idea that other countries had to pay child support just like America, but I think it makes sense considering it's their child.
However, I found out that it is a part of Islamic law, derived from the Quran and the Hadith.
I found it interesting how there are many similarities between Islam and Christianity, something before this class that I would not even imagine.
It is unfortunate how these extremists have altered the perspective of this religion that is almost identical to the Christian faith.
In life, I feel as though many read what they want to read, hear what they want to hear and so on and so forth.
Thats a really cool comparison you made with that childrens book.
That idea really resonated with me when Rafi came in to talk to us.
I always assumed that women just could not show any skin, I did not think it would be for religious reasons.
All of the girls are proud too, I thought it was great that they were able to discuss and educate the whole class on the background of the hijab.
I have never learned anything about the Muslim religion before but when Sam compared the Quran and the Bible they are actually similar in some ways.
Raffi cleared this up in lecture and explained what Muslims actually follow in the Quran and explain the version the Taliban pressures them to follow.
They have standard beliefs similar to the Christian religion which is something I would have never in a million years assumed.
I think not judging something you aren't familiar with is extremely important and something I've taken away from this class.
It was funny when he asked the class who is going to heaven based on what was listed on the screen and I think one person in the entire room raised their hand.
I too found it incredibly amazing and eye opening that nobody actually truly knows what Jesus would want them to do unless he were to come back and tell each person how to act and practice their faith.
As human beings, we will always argue about something.
The words written in each of these books are subject to their own personal interpretation and until people realize that these books were not written to govern bodies of people, there will continue to be strife and sides taken on this matter.
This goes to show what the civilians in Afghanistan are really like and the character that they uphold.
I think that he started the class really well by talking about some of the stereotypes we associate with Sharia law whenever we hear the term.
It is also viewed as a negative thing here in the west.
I think that is was also useful how Dr. Richards pointed out how similar the Quran and the Bible are.
They are used as a guide in how to live in the world we do ethically today and also where we are going in the future.
It is also neat to consider the value of interpretation in regards to the way we live our lives.
Though I was raised in the Middle East, in Dubai, I had no idea that Afghanistan had malls and extravagant houses.
I always thought it was one of the most war-torn countries with zero to little development.
What really bothers me is when innocent lives are killed and most importantly when people with good intentions are murdered.
Rafis partner, Rahin being killed for his attempt of bringing peace really hurt me.
I never understood the concept of what U.S. soldiers do in Afghanistan so I did some research and found out that U.S. soldiers are trying to protect Afghanistan from constant threat by remaining al Qaeda fighters and feuding warlords.
I agree with everything that you said Jill, and this part of the class also resonated with me, and I thought that it was also very interesting.
I think that Dr. Richards did a good job to show how there are going to be extremists in any religion, and this is something that is not just associated with Islam.
I was intrigued by the point you made about American divorces.
It is interesting to see the differences between the two countries.
In my discussion group, one of the black devils was in my class and talked about how they had scripts to follow, which makes sense, but I wanted to hear more from them.
He should definitely do this again, but I think a few adjustments would make it much more interesting.
I personally do not agree with this Bible verse because if this were true there would not be a single person in this world going to Heaven.
People cannot help who they love or want to be with and to punish them with going to Hell for loving someone of the same gender is not what I believe God would say.
I believe that he loves all his children especially if they are good people.
I have a cousin who is gay, but he is also extremely religious and dedicated to his family.
He goes to church every Sunday, wears his gold cross around his neck every day, and has Sunday dinner with his family every Sunday as well and to say that just because he is gay he will not go to Heaven is an outrage to me.
I do not care what you practice as long as you do not force Bible stories down my throat.
In this class period, Sam asked Rafi why he continues to do work that threatens his life and his family.
But Rafi had a beautiful response that essentially said, if not me than who?
Theres so many things going on in our world, and even if its not threatening our lives, there is something we can do to fix it.
Whether we see someone being discriminated against because of their gender or religion or sexual orientation, Rafi insists that its our job to be the change we want to see.
I personally think this is a lot easier said than done, especially when I try to put myself in Rafis shoes.
I know people who join the military in the US accept this kind of threat, but they are protecting themselves with weapons, whereas Rafi just tries to stay peaceful.
Anyway, its really just the desperation in Rafis voice that made me so emotional listening to his speech.
I agree completely as those books lead to various interpretations that can be considered erroneous from both sides.
Due to their conciseness and lack of detail, these books can be manipulated to morally police people who dont follow their interpretations.
Now to go off on a different tangent, I think that a lot of people make their religion dominate their life too much.
From what I have seen, what every religion says is to be a good person and dont screw someone elses life.
If you are atheist it is easy for you then!
Rafi is just a humble man begging the world to be a more peaceful place, and if my country is trying to silence people who share his viewpoints I dont understand how we can call ourselves the home of the free.
We are a predominantlyChristian nation that was founded on Christian principles.
Maybe its because at that point in time humans did not fully understand the capacity of their minds but they attributed all their ideas to, hearing it from God.
I really enjoyed this clip because Sam changed the prospective of how we use the Bible in Christianity to adapt it to make it work for Sharia Law.
I think that the Muslim religion is commonly associated with a negative stigma of Sharia Law in the United States but that is not the case for every person who practices the Muslim religion.
The issue with that is everyone reads the Quran with all different interpretations just like the bible.
But for Christians we view Sharia law with such a negative outlook but yet if we used the Bible to run a country it would look very similar to Sharia Law.
It is hard to image how life would be if the Bible was the main source and guideline for our law system.
It is so hard to connect with what is happening in the middle east when you do not have any immediate connection to the war that is happening there.
Being able to know someone directly affected really moved me.
It got me thinking on how little the US does as a country in order to help out the people whos lives they have ruined.
The way we as Americans see that our involvement is justified is perplexing.
All the destruction we cause just for oil a natural resource that is prominent in a country that is not America.
Why are we allowed to take someone elses resources by force it makes no sense to me?
The economy, the social work, and education have all been impacted by the war.
This is something that never really crossed my mind.
It is easy to put myself in their shoes when I think about my neighborhood, my family, my friends.
When LTC Garey told the story of the village elder, who will be compliant with any side that is imposing their will on the village.
I to started questioning my religion last year and a realized there are so many holes in it and sometimes contradicts itself.
Honestly, at the end of the day, everybody is just trying to have an enjoyable meaningful life.
He talks about how every Christian interprets the Bible differently.
This is just one example of Christians, even in the same denomination, having different views on social issues because of their specific interpretation of the Bible.
This would be extremely hard because people of all religions interpret their version of the Bible differently, even if they classify themselves as the same religion.
This applies to Muslim society as well; the Quran does not explain all specific details about everything, either.
If the Bible were specific enough to describe every situation without any room for interpretation, there would be less argument against what each passage means.
For one book to explain everything would solve a lot of issues, but people would still find ways to bend it to serve their own purposes.
It is all true in the sense of the word because it is all relative to different people.
I agree that living life as the bible would have us live is a ridiculous way to go about living especially as a college kid.
I grew up Christian as well, but like you, I barely go to church anymore and I question faith.
The Bibles teachings will always be important but as the world changes, faith needs to account for these changes as well.
This is a common theme I have found in my eccentric sociology class.
Sam will always force conversations with people about the very reason they are hesitant to start a conversation in the first place.
And let me just say, this kind of thing has changed my perspective on so many things.
We have to talk about the stuff that makes us uncomfortable or race and cultural relations will not improve.
The American women literally put themselves in someone elses shoes (hijab) and walked around.
The problem why these people are not being equated to ISIS is because they are white, not Jewish though.
As a result, the people can somehow, atleast by some convoluted way relate to twisted people like Neo Nazis.
This is why SOC 119 is important for getting people to understand all the sides.
I remember this class very well and thought it was interesting.
I agree with your thoughts on how Americans fail to recognize extremist in the United States who practice Christianity and I actually wrote about that in my first response as well.
I think in reality both Islam and Christianity are very similar but people are unwilling to see that because they do not want explore other religions.
But regardless of which religion one practices it is all based off of your interpretations which will vary from person to person no matter what religion it is.
Ive always wondered how a person or a group of people can read the Quran or the Bible and interpret it in the way that they do.
In some cases, they will torture and kill people in order to get people to submit to their extremist views of their religion.
Both the Taliban and Christian extremist groups have killed, even slaughtered, those who didnt believe in their version of the religion, yet both the Quran and Bible enforce that people shouldnt kill.
I agree with everything you are saying and its nice to know that this class is impacting everyone and making us all think outside of the box.
I grew up catholic but do not follow it anymore.
I also find it strange that it seems like religion in the west is laid back now compared to earlier generations.
It is really sad that people will use their religion as an excuse to discriminate against others and end up doing things that totally go against other teachings in the bible.
Heck, theres even pastors who will not marry two because of different Christian denominations.
But I do agree with you that we could be moving backwards.
Im not just talking about one specific party either.
Not pursue violence simply because we disagree.
When leaving this lecture discussion I was left with the overall thought that is that religion can be a good guide for many but can also be an evil curse and excuse for others to act in barbaric ways.
In order to stop this religion needs to return to its original meaning of peace and unity and adjust to the changes in society today or the threatening hostility levels will continue to grow.
About 8 years ago, my family and I traveled to New Mexico and there we visited reservations where Native American tribes were still living.
Both of these issues, genocide against Native Americans and slavery, are the reason why race is such a big issue in America.
Women have the right to divorce whoever they want, similar to the United States.
It would be interesting to see if other western countries grant women the same rights; such as Saudi and Yemen.
Having been raised Catholic and studying what the Bible teaches, it is ridiculous how much is up to interpretation and how that can be manipulated.
It is also easy to see only extremes when we are only looking at passages without their knowing their background.
However, it also allows us to see similarities between different groups.
Sam's test in class on who was going to go to Heaven on that criteria alone is very accurate.
By that criteria alone, not many people would be going to Heaven, especially with how society and the media promote some of those acts.
If you killed or captured enough of your opposing forces troops, eventually they will give in.
However in more recent years, late 20th Century and in to the 21st Century, this status quo has changed; warfighting is no longer conventional.
Sometimes they will sometimes they dont.
We now have to learn about and understand the culture of the people we are fighting against.
Winning in a complex world by means of unified land operations requires more than that.
It is also about winning the hearts and minds.
Granted I am not an expert on Islam, but I am fairly confident it is the same, in that Muslims can choose how religious they would like to be.
A prime example of this (Im pretty sure someone during class said this), is that a Muslim said they do not pray five times a day like you would typically expect.
When Sam began to talk aboutAfghanistan, he asked the question, When someone says Afghanistan, what do you think?
It made me want to become more aware of the fact that Afghanistan isn't just some country far away that gets bombed, and that is filled with war.
There are two things that I took away from this video.
The other thing that I took away from this lesson is that if we wanted to be involved we can.
You brought a lot of ideas to the table that I completely agree with.
The idea that people should live their lives based on a book, has always amazed me.
Life would not be as interesting if everyone were to follow the so called rules of the Bible or the Quran.
That is what makes life what it is.
What I find ridiculous is that people spend their time worrying about whether others are following the rules or are living their lives as they please.
As long as we do not push it to the extreme where we have to think twice on whether it is a sin, then the act should not occur.
I really like your point on how it is important to know that different religions are interpreted in different ways.
I liked your connection to the Bhagavad Gita and was thinking about this while watching the video.
If you interpret it exactly, it talks about how Pandavas and Kauravas engage in war on each other (fighting their own families) but if you understand the situation, it is advising to take situations carefully.
Not until when I decided to read a novel that was written by an Afghani writer.
And how one of them was a rich one while the other was the son of the rich family servant.
I cannot describe how I felt when I was reading that book.
I cried severely in the sorrow moments and I smiled hard in the happy ones.
Now although I always got the sense that religion stayed out of places dealing with the government,but I never knew that there was an actual piece of legislature saying that its not allowed.
This really was actually kind of surprising to me considering the amount of religion that is used in political campaigns and such.
I understand that people can like a candidate due to their religion, but its not like they would be able to bring any of the aspects of that religion into their position in the government, so why does it even really matter?
The fact that this man, who was involved with the trump administration, is even respected in any way, is ridiculous.
Hi Alex, I liked what you wrote and I just want to clarify things out.
While for Shia it is slightly different because there is not divorce if the man just said the word, it has be in court.
Hope you this help you to understand that divorce is not some easy thing in Islam.
However, it is at the choice of your own free will to do so.
I understand Sams perspective that the Bible may not be specific enough that it caused it to be open to personal interpretations.
However, the Bible was written from a historical stand point.
The Bible is not a guideline on how to deal with specific situations or else it would have been a book with infinite pages that no one would read.
However, I was taught to believe that we are born initially as sinners.
However, it is up to the individual to see if they want to change and live the Christian way.
I agree with you that people are really good at appearing very religious but have proven not to be based on their behind-the-scenes activities.
If thats the case, then it is not faith, its simply a coping mechanism by appearing religious.
However, I do agree with everything you are saying.
After all, isn't the end goal of believing in somethingthe same for every religion?
So when the establishment clause comes up it almost seems like it isn't very effective due to the vast amounts of Christians.
But when looked at more closely, one can tell that various religions are being more accepted here everyday.
Saying all this, I can see the issue of religion from many different view points, but I can for sure say I agree with yours.
It was shocking to hear from someone who experienced this first hand and how he believes that Mosul will not be a habitable area for about another year.
It was good to see that the country was making steps in the right direction toward recovery and that Bosim hopes that in four months he will be able to move back home and begin a life in Mosul again.
I agree heavily with what Sam said at the end that history is hard to study because currently we are living it.
It just shows how much the country changed in just sixteen years and many people are blind to the conflicts that occur frequently in the Middle East.
If everyone lived behind the words and used them as a guidebook for daily lives, there is no room for exploration or expression on how we make decisions.
As time changes, innovation increases, and education is expanded, individuals are able to expand knowledge on not only subjects in school, but about religion and mold their own views regarding it.
We all cannot have cookie cutter minds to make decision, life is about failure and expedition personally, religiously, and in any sector of life we come across.
Nonetheless it was an intriguing idea to me before, just because I knew that back then Christians and Catholics use to have wars and kill each other.
Instead he turned to his religion and forgave the Americans for what they did to him.
But Basim did not proceed to stereotype all Americans as violent and harsh.
This is completely wrong because only a select group of people are committing these horrible crimes.
I assumed that Basim would be angrier with America for what had happened but really he learned how to forgive the Americans who made this mistake.
Long story short, it is important to not make assumptions about a society based on the actions of a small set of people.
So I agree with you that government should be separate from religion but I disagree with your point that using the bible as a daily guide of life can be harmful.
I think I was in preschool so I can't say I remember anything that happened.
I cannot fathom the heartbreak or the reality that this man has gone through.
As Sam explains, we have trouble empathizing due to the sole fact that these war zones are strictly looked at as only war zones.
Growing up the news was something I would hide from when my parents turned on the tv.
Still to this day I can find it to be scary, however, I am older and I believe it's important to know what's going on in the world.
I did not know that the exact reason for going into Iraq was for their oil.
It disgusts me that America has this superiority complex where we can take whatever we want from others.
If you look back on history, Americans have always been this way.
I didnot know that they could freely leave their marriages though.
I live for love and it breaks my heart to see two people spending their lives together that do not unconditionally love one another.
I believe everyone deserves a life partner through all the ups and downs that are thrown at us.
After all that has happened to him how does Bassim not loathe America?
Not only is everything destroyed but you lose your significant other, daughter and dog.
But what really shows his character is the fact that he realized he is not benefitting from his attitude.
Therefore, after looking at his religion Bassim forgave us.
That quality right there reminds me of the Afghan people who invite complete strangers into their homes to share a meal even though they are under attack.
Once again Soc119 has brought another new topic to my attention.
When Sam said we were going to reverse the roles of white and black people, I honestly did not know what to expect.
I understand he was trying to provoke an understanding in white people by explaining all the ways black people have been oppressed by putting ourselves in their shoes, but I thought it could have gone a bit deeper.
In the activity when the black people would respond to the white people with comments such as reverse discrimination is real, working harder will help you accomplish anything, and that all happened in the past, I don't know why you're still upset about it.
I didn't do that, it all sounded so ridiculous as I put myself in an oppressed, black persons' shoes.
Imagine if something like that happened in America and an Afghan plane accidentally dropped a bomb on the homes of innocent people.
Hearing Bassim's story also gave me a whole other perspective on life in Afghanistan.
It is almost like we have been conditioned in America to think of war zones anytime we hear about Afghanistan.
I like how Sam compares the Sharia law to the Old Testament, because it is very similar to that.
Even though it is a good basis on how we should live our lives in general, it did not have everything we as humans are going to face.
It is true we all interpret it differently.
Most people believe that the whole Islam religion is violent and they fight against people who are not part of them, they have laws which seems to be oppressive to us on the outside.
These are just a few of christian extremist groups we have but we never say Christianity is a violent religion.
Even still, each book is subject to interpretation, which I have found reflects more heavily on the interpreter than the book itself.
This has caused tension towards the topic of Muslims in America; however, we never really take the time to consider how these terrorists are seen in the minds of other Muslims.
However, more so recently, I wonder what it really means to be one.
I completely agree that old books should not determine today's laws, but it is so ingrained in our society that I don't know how we would change this.
America was founded on Christian morals even though we claim that it was areligious.
I also agree with you that laws created from religious texts are now probably outdated, however, they have been in legal codes for so long that it is again probably extremely difficult to remove them.
And of course the class isnt going to be entirely made up of Christians but the realization I think we all had was that almost every Christian that we know of does not follow those rulesmaybe the Willard Preacher doesbut still, the chances are very slim.
Extortion, sodomy, intoxicants, gambling, all of these things mean youd be turned away at the Gates of Heaven.
That statement is plain and simple and clearly understood by the general public since homosexuality is still hated by many.
According to the Barna Group, an evangelical Christian polling group that has been tracking spiritual trends in the US for 30 years says that only 17% of serious Christians have biblical worldview.
The US did not make them wear certain clothes or take away privileges but they did take away lives.
He knows the Iraq he once knew has been taken away from him.
He has witnessed this shift to the horrible state Iraq is in right now.
This man had to watch his family get smothered out of his life.
He now believes that Iraq will not return to the height he once knew.
No matter what he has been through, he wants to be himself and there for his son.
I do not know what Iraq was like before the war, but it was much better than what it is now.
A lot easier said than done, but the future is unpredictable so who knows what will happen.
The Christian and Islamic (as well as other religions) are very similar in the fact that we all pray and live by the same standards of life.
In the US especially we tend to tie the Islamic religion to terrorism because we have seen and hear of stories of terrorists announcing their horrible acts in the name of Allah (the God of the Islamic religion); because these stories we tend to automatically assume that all Muslims who practice the Islamic religion are terrorist and their whole religion is based on violence and bloodshed.
Yet when we see extremist in our own countries such as the members of the Westboro Baptist Church (in the United States) who proclaim that God hates Muslims, Gays and Jews we say the excuse that they are not real Christians and instead that they are just a bunch of extremists who dont really understand the Bible and Gods teachings.
In addition, as Sam mentioned in this video, there are other Christian groups who are just as violent as the terrorists we see in the Middle East yet we dont talk about them because to us they are not real Christians.
If we take the time to learn about other religions we can actually find a lot more similarities with our own personal religion than differences.
Its crazy to me how differently people interpret the same exact words.
My question though would be if Jesus himself reappeared and told these violent and hateful people that what they were doing was wrong, how many of them do we think would change their ways and become the peaceful people Jesus wants them to be?
I also read the Kite Runner, it was a very good book.
No matter what country you are form you have a life.
It can be glamorous or retched but you have a life.
So many are invested in their own lives that they look at other people and reflect back on themselves.
When you look at someone from another country, treat that view like a window not a mirror.
Although from what the article mentioned a majority of women's rights were taken away when the Taliban came into power.
The Taliban won't allow women to attend school or go to work, which are the stories that the media covers now.
Lastly, making a law system in the United States based on the Bible goes against the incentive that led people to move across the Atlantic to come to America: to have religious freedom.
Even if it is done with good intentions or written in a sensitive manner, developing a set of laws based on one specific sacred text (in this case, the Bible) will give certain groups a blatant advantage and preference over others.
We would be choosing one religion over another, which defeats our goal of creating a nation where all men and women are treated as equals.
While this got many kids and parents worked up across the nation, it never bothered me because there were a number of Jewish people in my town, and as a child, a party is a party!
These demands for reverting back is ignoring the fact that the founding fathers distinctly did not want a repeat of England where only one religion could be right.
Then he brought up Basim Razzo and he was walking us through his life.
But then it took a complete turn when Sam said that the Americans had bombed his house.
And all I could feel was a sense of dread for this person that I had never even met.
Then Sam continued to tell us that his wife, his daughter, his brother, and his nephew all died from this accidental bomb.
And then Sam read to us the message he received from Basim about how his light of his life was gone.
And I dont think I could even begin to imagine anything that he went through.
But then he came up onto the screen through skype and I was instantly taken aback.
However, hearing about Basims story actually forced me to think about what was actually going on in the world, and realize that real people just like you and me are going through life situations that are much worse than most of us can imagine.
And, when Sam introduced Basim to the entire class through Skype, you could actually hear the gasps and shock in the room.
For me, it just cemented the reality of what Sam was telling us.
However, those stereotypes are no different from the Christians we see preaching hate to everyone on the street.
Even though the reality may be hard to swallow sometimes, its important to know the truth- or at least to hear someone elses side of the story.
Luke, you make some awesome points in your post that show the change in your thinking.
I too was raised Christian and also had the period of questioning what I was taught to believe.
I also agree with you that the Bible is able to be interpreted differently by individual people.
I also agree with you that it was an eye opening experience and showed the thought process of people that thinks differently than me.
It's important to remember that there are extremists in both religions who skew the view of what the teachings actually are.
In this lecture he focuses on the people who follow the Muslim and Christian religions.
For example, the KKK is quickly referred to as a hate group who identifies as Christians.
However, most Christians claim that these people are not actually followers of the religion.
There is a lot of distortion and misunderstandings about the Muslim religion that people are scared to confront because they have a conditioned fear of Muslims because of what the Muslims have been generalized as.
This lecture is titled A Class on Empathy which I think was a perfect fit for this lecture.
Its such a tragic thing what happened and the fact that he was able to forgive after that is inspiring to me.
A lot of us hold grudges on small things and we often forget that there are people out there losing their life treasures and cant do anything about it.
With all of the life events that Basim has gone through, its amazing for him to say that he doesnt hate Americans.
I feel like many people are so quick to jump to conclusions that we often forget that cities like Mosul have real people just like us.
It takes time to forgive, but as mentioned earlier, both forgiveness and anger go a long way.
It would do no one any good for him to be angry about what the United States did.
I think that is something that we as Americans are not good at doing.
If we were able to forgive the people responsible for the attacks of 9 11 or any other terrorist attacks we have suffered and were able to separate the small portion of people actually responsible for them from the larger portion of people that were not involved in any way, we would probably have much better relations with people of other cultures.
It was truly amazing how Sam shows us that we are no different from other undeveloped countries.
He also said that everyone should come together and make peace, not having fighting and wars going on all the time.
When your home is destroyed and your family is taken from you, it seems difficult to me to have happiness again.
Everyone makes mistakes in life and I feel blessed to have the life that I do.
Yes, we are trying to protect our country, but killing innocent people and destroying the lives of so many, is not the way to make our country any better.
This just shows the other countries that we are weak.
I agree on the fact that the Quran and Bible are similar in the way that they can easily be interpreted based on the beliefs of the person reading it.
I also agree, that are the Americans really making the best decisions for us?
Today, it is so hard to see the good behind the evil.
You have to ask yourself, what is it that I actually believe?
I understand what you are saying about how the US is being selfish and not thinking about what other people are going through.
I can not imagine a day where we are all in peace.
I believe that is an appropriate, I think if I was in Bassims shoes I would be numb for a very long time.
He said he was for a couple months but I feel like I would be numb for years.
I agree with this due to the fact that staying angry for too long is not a good thing and that is not a good way of living, but I feel like I could not help but be angry.
Family means everything to me and if I lost them due to a bombing, I would be so angry with the people who did it.
I feel like people make up their own interpretation of the words to justify their own actions thinking that they are right.
If we have to think twice of whether or not an act is a sin, we shouldnt have to go back to the books for it to be verified.
I always wondered why women wore hijabs and if they ever feel uncomfortable wearing hijabs.
I also had a lot of questions and wondered what it was like.
The women also said that they felt empowered and that instead of being oppressed, they are walking around campus with their heads up and almost above others.
But aside from that, he talked about how he deals with it today and how it has impacted him as a person.
I found it extremely humbling to find out how he did not hold a grudge against America for this and how strong Basim truly is as a person.
In general, people shouldnt be racist towards particular groups just because they have experienced a bad encounter with someone of that race or religion or let alone just heard stories and stereotypes.
However, he is better than that and even has American friends, like Sam.
As I sat in class and listened to all of the horrible things that happened to Basim, it really put things into perspective for me.
However, I never thought of what it would be like if I didnt have them here to tell me important things.
It was interesting how this was the same question someone asked him the previous year he spoke.
Due to the fact that he is Muslim, his religion told him to forgive and guide him through his life.
If something like this were to happen to me, I know I would be angry at first too.
However, I agree with his response that learning to forgive is extremely important.
You simply will never move on in life if you are at battle with yourself.
I believe that God would want me to see that there is still a purpose in life and to keep my head up.
This really hit me, the kindness and forgiveness that he shows in truly incredible.
I agree that not only religion and politics shape our beliefs, but nearly all the influences we are exposed to everyday whether it is your family, friends, or a personal experience.
In my personal opinion, I think those who follow the bible, which is just simply a book, to essentially live their lives is an interesting concept.
However, this is just another thing that I would love to learn more about and hear different peoples opinions on.
I, too, wondered that same question while I was sitting in class listening to him describe the destruction he has faced and the family members he has lost.
Basim does say he went through a period of a few months where he was angry, then he raises a valid point that the anger would eat him from the inside, and that his religion tells him to forgive.
He had a good experience meeting many Americans and befriending some to see the good in Americans.
I dont believe everyone would be able to forgive so easily if they were in Basims shoes.
And that fact alone, was one of the main reasons I enrolled in this class.
We are so ingrained in our perspectives of the world unless we can take time to understand another persons struggles and look through their lens.
I wonder if any people in the class are having trouble seeing the points that Sam tries to make because I personally experience many aha!
Never did I expect to see fancy buildings similar to what we have here in the United States.
Yes, these people deal with the direct impact of war on a daily basis, but they still live normal lives in some aspect.
He is a father of children and wants to provide the best possible life for them.
All the time we are self-indulged in the affairs of our own that we rarely leave the American bubble.
Something had to be done to retaliate but the fact that thousands if not millions of innocent lives were affected by our direct action is not right.
The idea that it mentions all the people who would be excluded from going to Heaven and the long list this it is amazing.
The idea that the people opposed to homosexuality picked that out that passage and only specifically that one line sows how people go out of their way to oppose it.
And I completely agree, people fall in love with whoever they fall in love with.
There is no way in stopping that, and the people who want to stop that should realize it.
It is hard to try to imagine all the hardships that the people in that country must endure with war right at their door step.
Hearing the perspective from both sides of the war was very helpful to surface things that I would have never thought about.
I agree with the fact that it is almost ironic that many Americans scrutinize against and are afraid of Sharia Law, when in fact Americans are just as sexist and controlling in the Christian faith.
This is even sadder than seeing people died from natural disaster because obviously innocent people shouldnt be dying from some issues between countries that the civilians cant even control.
Theres always a joke (or a truth) between Taiwanese people that China already have thousands of missiles aiming at us and if they really want to take over Taiwan they can easily bomb us and destroy the island within minutes.
This video reminds me of the topic that we always joked around.
The first thing that come to my mind is kind of selfish.
I feel like they have already realized the true meaning of life to a level that I can never reach in my life.
Most of the survivors look so peaceful when taking about the disaster like nothing big happened.
I wonder how painful it will be to overcome the sorrow of losing love ones and a place you grew up and lived for the entire life.
But shouldnt the government be representing the people in the country?
Politics might be a thing I can never understand.
This was the most moving lecture I have seen yet and I feel very lucky that I was able to experience this connection.
Basim explained that his anger was hurting him more than it was helping him so he had to channel the energy to elsewhere.
He had many American friends, and was able to recognize that the American people he knew were good people.
Basim amazingly uses his Muslim religion faith to forgive those who committed the most evil of crimes against him and his people.
Basim uses his faith to guide his life and transformed his anger into motivation to fight for peace and work with foreign affairs.
You also raise a good point that most of the information we get from the news are statistics and line graphs.
Personally, I did not love that class because I did think that it was hard to follow when the roles were reversed.
He is trying to say that when you step into the shoes of other people and see the world through other people you see the world in a different perspective.
I agree that tolerance level is always going to be challenged as long if we are open to it.
It has been eye opening to hear about other types of people in this amazing world that we live in.
He also spoke about how the US entered Iraq looking for mass distraction weapons but while they were there they dismantled a whole system, such as education.
The saddest thing I watched was how he lost his family.
Basim forgave the people who destroyed majority of his family and his home.
I would never think that I was better than someone who was raised following a different religion.
A lot of people have the stereotype of Islamic people are radical, but Bassim is a real live example that this stereotype is wrong.
When Sam said that Basim told him that even his dog did not survive, I felt so sad.
He is not angry and he has learnt to forget, not forgetting all the people he loves, but forgetting the hurts.
As his life did not end in that bomb, he has to carry on.
He does not have the hate towards other Americans, but he wants more people to know that many people in Iraq lives worse than him.
As the American government has broken a system, it has to do something to fix it.
Whatever religion we believe, we are all expecting the same for ourselves and our families.
What I mean is that the Arabic version at first glance looks like a notably longer book at a glance.
With what I am about to say I am not trying to accuse Sam of anything, however the generalizations might not educate people well about a relatively important topic.
Although it would be a bad idea to implement Sharia law fully with modern society its important to realize that it was arguably appropriate for its time.
After this lecture I began to research ISIS and everything they have done.
I could never imagine something like that happening in the United States.
Having a group come in forcing all women to wear veils, force all men to grow beards, cut their pants as well as taking away the internet, cable etc its absolutely terrifying that this stuff happens.
Also when ISIS came in what happened to Iraqs previous government?
Also do we know what ISISs end plan is like are they planning on taking over more countries?
However, the United States had already changed Iraqi peoples lives much before ISIS came into Iraq, as Bassim said.
I personally think that the United States has affected Iraq more than what ISIS has.
Sadly, Iraq seems like if it was not going to change nor improve until a long period of time.
This situation not only regards to Iraq but to many other countries around the world that are being intervened by other countries.
They could receive advice; however they are the ones that must decide where they want to stand in life along with their country.
However, the help they need is that other countries start listening to what Iraqi citizens are saying.
This is what has made Iraq what it is now and people want to stop it.
How could my country, a place where I luckily feel safe, commit the horrible act of bombing an innocent mans home.
It was said to be a miscalculation; however, this does not change the fact that Bassims, wife, daughter, brother and dog were killed.
They were killed by the people of the place I call home.
I had never thought about the devastating things that can happen to innocent Afghans while at war with the US.
I had only thought about the people committing these acts and sometimes foreigners that had encountered these terrorist groups.
I had heard it so many times that I began to believe it, I knew that life was different in the Middle East, but how different?
Bassims story made me realize that the lives of innocent citizens were far from different than my own.
Now that I am informed, when I come across that brutal exchange of words I will use Bassim as an example and his heart wrenching words, my light is no more.
It is inspiring to hear him speak about his faith and how it guides him though out his life to forgive others.
I also told my family to watch this lecture because of how much it impacted me in my life.
I just feel that the way he responds to this event in amazing.
I also agree with what he said about anger.
I neither agree nor disagree with Abigail because we have not been in Bassims situation so we do not understand what he has bene through nor we know we would do if that happened to us.
I really respect this man even though I do not know him.
Also, I think that he is a great example, as I said before, which many of us should follow in our lives regardless of the situation in which we might be involved in.
I found this interesting because most professors at Penn State do not alter their lecture plans from semester to semester, even if it would make sense if they did.
Violent group such as the KKK in America are rarely ever thought of being Christian because they are radial.
This could be the same for the radical terrorist who identify as being Muslim.
I am not saying that, as a Jewish person I am offended by this, let alone give it a second thought, I am just raising a point that religion is embedded in places that you may never think of.
I thought it was interesting how you said that religion is outdated, due to mostly the technology enhancement the world has received.
This was very beneficial for early societies, but now with the information overload these books leave a lot of room for misinterpretation.
The acts of terror that Americans view in the news are often strung back to a religious view at the core of it.
I do agree with you that religion can be an okay guide or outline to society rules and values, but it can lead to a lot of evil and hate.
Religious and race conflicts are so deeply rooted, and are very hard to fix.
I think that the idea of forgiving is difficult to actually carry through.
The American government took away everything Bassim had.
It is easier to forgive for smaller and lighter problems, but hearing Bassim say that he is able to forgive after this incident is very touching to me.
I also think that he is wise to be able differentiate between the American Government and Americans.
I respect that he does not group people together after what the United States government did to his life.
Some may think that Muslims are solely hostile people but in reality, their religion teaches forgiveness.
I believe that learning to forgive is a quality of a great person.
Another topic that was interesting to me was a comment that a student made after Bassim spoke.
This is a good thought because it makes me wonder about the tension between religions.
We as humans become less sensitive to tragedy when it is further away.
Overall, this was the most impactful lecture of SOC 119 for me so far as it gave me a new perspective to see from.
I was very surprised when Basim said he had forgiven Americans for killing so much of his family, as I personally do not think I would be able to.
I think at the heart of most religions is essentially just the message of being a good person.
Although we divide religions up based on many different factors, almost all of them come back to core values of forgiveness, kindness, and love.
In fact, if you want to fully keep up with all of the events that are going on in the world, you have to try extremely hard and look at multiple sources.
I think that's what shocked me the most.
After everything he's been through, I am amazed that he is strong enough to forgive.
Although it wasn't in the clip, I want to discuss something that was said in class.
I don't think anybody really hates this country, but instead they want to have discussions because it is part of the history whether we like it or not.
I do agree that the United States is not the only country that has blood on its hands.
However, to really get past the issues we have in the United States, we must talk about it, although it can be uncomfortable at times.
I was surprised how much information I learned by those interactions because those questions were the ones that are afraid to be asked in normal interactions because it is not acceptable in societal norms because of fear of offending someone.
It shocks me that so many different European countries have banned the wearing of head dresses (I believe there are 12).
France tried to ban the Burkini style but that was later lifted due to the ban being so confining and oppressing to women.
I noticed when they started putting the hijabs on the other girls, there was an instant connection over fashion which is nice because that is a universal topic that most girls faun over.
Basim also made the choice to not live his life in fear despite his country (especially his city) being consumed by war by both our government and Isis.
We learn from our parents who learned from their parents about how great the US is and the opportunities it can provide.
Since this is how people grow up, they don't really know anything different.
There are major wars or revolutions that I am just learning about now because our history classes were so focused on the USs history.
The thing that is amazing about this class is that it helps students to see issues from anothers perspective.
It allowed the American girls to ask things that they were wondering instead of guessing or making assumptions that were likely to be incorrect.
The white and african american women were able to step into the muslim womens shoes (or hijab in this case) and see what that feels like first hand.
He goes on to say that all he is trying to accomplish in this lecture is a valuable comparison between the Islamic and Christian Sharia.
Ive havent heard much about the Islamic sharia because I would consider myself a Christian, butI was open to learn more about it.
What shocked me the most was when Sam said speaking from a sociologist point of view, the Quran is very similar to the New Testament.
I would have never guessed that because I would have never even guessed that Jesus was mentioned in the Quran.
He then gives a few real life examples: your neighbor's dog pooping on your lawn, or drinking while driving, or driving too fast, etc.
I think it is rally cool that Sam gives us the opportunity to learn first hand about so many different cultures.
The thing that surprised me the most was when the white girls asking the questions tried on the hijabs and not one of them had a negative reaction.
The Muslim women in our class freely choose to wear their hijab, they like it and feel more comfortable with it on and they each have different reasons why they wear it.
I would disagree on your statement that religion is an excuse to do inhuman things because you're referring to the minority of people in those groups.
Your main basis for an argument is history, which to some aspect: yes, the way they lived wouldn't be accepted today.
I do agree with you that saying SOME passages in religious books are outdated, but to say that all the morals and beliefs in the Bible Karan are outdated is completely misleading.
The best way to overcomesomething so tragic is to forgive even though it is an extremely tough thing to do.
It was very interesting to get his perspective on the middle east because as Americans, the only perspective we have is our own.
I cannot express enough his bravery that he can so openly share such a tragic experience in his life.
You're going about your everyday day life.
I think often about Bassim saying that his wife was just two feet away from him.
This was the first moment where I found admiration in Bassim.
A side note, but something I found appalling was the dollar about that the U.S. offer Bassim for his losses.
But he recognized that living his life in anger was only hurting himself and hindering any progress.
Now, think about anyone you've ever held a grudge against.
If Bassim can forgive this unforgivable crime, we can can forgive others who have wronged us.
He made this lecture hilarious while also making a point.
He showed that parts of the Bible can get to be extreme and irrational but only if it was read by radicals.
The same thing applies to the Quran, it can be extreme if only parts are taken out by extremists.
I like his point that if the Bible is real word for word and taken literally it could be an extremely confining religion.
If they Bible should be looked at as if it was the Constitution.
Both were written many years ago without much knowledge on precisely how the future would be but set universal standards that should be followed.
Simply because it is not explicitly said what you can and cant do, it is still stealing and so that commandment can be adapted to modern times.
I think that it takes a certain amount of humility and also confidence to wear something everyday that outwardly expresses what you believe in.
I think that women live in a culture today where we feel pressured to look good all of the time.
When we talk about America, we really are talking about it from a historical standpoint.
Being closed minded is what causes issues with these topics.
You have to be willing to really listen to other people even if you disagree with what they're saying.
I think more than anything else however, it bridges the gap between many Christians and Muslims.
We speak so hatefully of Muslims for crimes that very very few of them commit.
And its important to note that Sam isn't hating on either religion, he's simply drawing perspective and shedding light on the hypocrisy that we live amongst.
I was always curious about hijabs and had so many questions about their reasoning for wearing it.
I was also surprised that the girls were not allowed to shake hands with men.
In addition to the swimwear I was surprised about the community pools for females only so that they could wear any type of swimsuit they pleased.
I fully believe that our country has laws that are reflected off of the bible.
Both religious books are a combination of stories explaining how we got to where we are and offering guidelines on where we go from here.
Sam brought up imagining using one book to determine every rule in your life.
I thought this was interesting because there are extremists both Christian and Muslim, who do this.
We have evolved from when these books were written.
And while yes, they are a wonderful spiritual guide, that is what they need to be left as- a guide, not a rulebook.
I think it is interesting when Sam brings up things like drinking and driving and stealing.
Because we all know that legally and morally, these things are wrong.
But for someone following this book to an exact interpretation, how do you handle that?
It is something very interesting because every person who reads the book, can interpret the stories differently.
I liked the way Sam tied in other religions kind of to say hey, we are all in the same boat together.
Today we are so numb to hearing about all the horrible stuff going on in the world and we never really put much thought into the people that are actually affected.
I can not even wrap my head around what Basim went through.
Two families were bombed and multiple people were killed for absolutely no reason at all and no one even heard about it!
The way they celebrated this holiday was similar to the way in which Christians celebrate a holiday like Easter.
I completely agree with you when you said that we as a whole fail to understand that no one religion is interpreted the same way by all people who follow it.
What we need to start doing is opening the discussion on who we are and how we interpret things in our own way and liking.
We are actually learning about the what Islams believe and how similar it is to both Christianity and Judaism.
I agree that it takes an open and clear mind to discuss these issues because it is such a touchy topic.
But the more we talk about them, the easier it becomes.
Growing up catholic, I never really questioned or deeply thought about my religious beliefs, because going to church every sunday and learning about Catholicism in school seemed like second hand nature.
Sam has even done a Ted Talk called, A radical experiment in empathy which was about the importance of empathy.
I believe empathy is the most important thing we can emphasize today in society.
While we are told, Treat others how you want to be treated from a young age, this mentality never hooks deep enough in us.
Learning about an issue, and having an open dialogue about an issue can create empathy for people involved with the situation which helps solve the issue.
When someone lives in a different country than you, looks different than, and worships a different religion, its easy to feel less for them.
Its our job to reject these feelings by educating ourselves about lives other people live which is what Sociology 119 does so well.
I, instead agree and think that every religion gives input to be a good person.
Religion values, whichever religion we talk about defines what people expect of themselves based on the beliefs common to the religions they practice.
After that week I realized I didnt want to be the person who didnt know anything about what was going on with the world outside of Philly.
It is up to us to do something with this lesson.
One way I plan to do that is joining the Peace Corp after graduation.
Ive seen their work first hand in Guatemala and they truly make a difference in peoples lives, all over the world.
For people who are teachers by professions, they have that opportunity to change that in our school teachings.
Now its up to us to do something about it.
When he realized the anger would eventually destroy him he realized he needed to forgive.
Basim taught me in a class period what it truly means to forgive.
Their hardships in Iraq and Afghanistan are ones we Americans can hardly understand.
We lack the empathy necessary to understand their ways of life and then, act as if they are the ones who are wrong.
How are we supposed to develop empathy for people who have a completely different language, norms, and experiences?
Basim is an ordinary middle-class guy that had his life turned upside down because of this war.
He cant really do much about it and he, as a Muslim, is forced to move away from his home because it is dangerous.
Here in America, I feel that there is just this sense of normality in life.
It is sickening that our military can destroy people who didn't choose to be involved with the war and expect to fix it with a small amount of money.
Many Americans did not support going into Iraq in the first place, yet the decision was made despite this.
It still blows my mind that the average American isn't fully aware of the destruction that is taking place.
I think that it is partially the media's fault because I feel that stories from people like Basim should be told.
If Americans knew exactly how much damage we actually created, then I doubt that they would support it as much.
But I do agree with your perspective.
After all, isnt God supposed to be merciful and loving?
I still dont really understand a lot of whats in the Bible but I dont think all of what is written is set in stone.
It is unfair to many citizens who do not follow that religion if not.
However, America was founded on laws related to religious beliefs, creating a nation of freedom that is only acceptable and sometimes legal under one religion.
So many historically famous documents and quotes are related to religion, specifically Christianity, and God.
I grew up learning the ten commandants being told to follow them, but as you put it, it seems impossible to not break at least one.
Because I break the Christians ten commandments does not mean I do not try and follow them.
In this class Sam invites his friend Basim Razzo to talk about himself, a regular person from Iraq and to talk about his experience and what he went through in the war.
Basim Razzo is a typical person, by that I mean he came to America to study, got his degree, got married, and went home to Mosul.
He goes on to saying that his religion taught him to forgive and he uses religion to guide his life.
To have the experience to speak with someone who has been through so much horror from my government was an experience I will carry with me for the rest of my life.
I admire his faith in his religion to forgive those who wronged him.
We are putting another countrys citizens at risk in an economic fight that could have just as easily been resolved through diplomacy.
I may not have any connection to Basim, but I do have a connection to the Iraq War.
I remember the joy I felt when I heard she had come home.
It hurts me to see a story like Basims because I realize how devastating that war could have been for my family.
I truly feel for him and hope that something like this never happens again.
He explained that he was comfortable being Christian or atheist, it really doesnt matter to him what religion he is defined by.
Anyone can claim that they are any religion but are they really living a life that follows the rules of that religion?
For these reasons, people should not generalize all people of a certain religion.
Even so, he still was able to move on from what the American government did.
The way Basim forgave and was able to move on with his life is truly inspiring.
Why'd you have to take most of my family, but leave me to suffer?
I think its easier to stay angry than try to move forward, but on the other hand, like you said, it will only fester inside of you and eat you alive.
It only prevents you from living your life to its fullest extent.
The words are not meant to be taken literally, in my opinion, but, instead, we should use the morals of each story to guide our lives.
Life and making life choices is so complicated and unique to every individual that a single book could never address all of those issues and tell you what is right and wrong.
Like you said, topics like divorce could never have a set list of rules of what is right and what is wrong because there are so many possible different scenarios.
Also, the things that are stated can be interpreted in so many different ways.
I agree with everything you had to say!
However, the young ladies in Hijabs in the front of the class seem to radiate with confidence more than anyone I have ever seen.
I honestly had no idea and I am glad they were able to share their lifestyle with the class.
However, as I got older, I started having guys that I have had relationships with tell me to stop looking at them certain ways.
I think this class really tied into the points about empathy towards other races that Sam also commented about in a previous lecture.
I like how you included your personal feelings before and after this class.
I can not bare going through the same thing he has went through.
I amount of strength this man has is something I have never seen before.
I honestly never thought this was possible.
So the people who is to get mad at is the American government which he also stated in the video.
Another thing he said is his friends was helping him.
After a while as well, you have to move on with your life.
Even though what happened can not be reversed should be one of the reasons you move on.
I dont associate every Muslim with 9 11, but radical Muslim terrorists have made the image of a Muslim man or woman something to hold prejudice against even if you try not to think of them in that way.
I feel like making western white and black woman who dont wears Burkas ask questions made it even more prevalent to how we as Americans see the world around us.
I also think that as our generation of Millennials starts to grow up into adults we are changing the way we see people of different ethnicities.
If we had this panel directly post 9 11 it would have been very racist and very ill seen.
I agree that the media plays a huge role in the ignorance that most Americans have today.
So, thats why we have to uncover the truth ourselves instead of relying on stations like CNN to tell us what happening in the world.
Thats why I try to keep up with whats happening in the world.
I think that this clip should be viewed by all of America, personally.
However, after meeting Basim via Skype, my entire perspective has changed.
However, amongst all of the negative we have brought into areas like Basim's town, he still doesn't hate us because of his FAITH.
I find this to be so beautiful in a sense.
They're often painted with a negative image, but people like Basim totally change that.
I think that there are so many people in this country that could learn a lot about different cultures just by taking the time to have a conversation with someone.
If only more students at Penn State and everywhere had the opportunity to meet such wonderful people like him.
I agree it is something terrible that needs to be expelled from society.
However, being able to do this is such a tall task because the type of people drawn to radicalism are lonely, lost, scared individuals looking for a palce to belong.
Sams point of showing so many different religious groups, but explaining how they see themselves as Christians really hammered this point home for me.
Our society tells us to get an idea as fast as possible and hold onto it.
In the United States, there are 892 active hate groups showing just how infinite the possibilities could be worldwide to not only interpret one religion, but skew any religion in any way humans see fit.
I also find your point about religion and the government being combined in the Middle East very interesting and surprising.
I don't believe that a religion has to define someone.
I also agree that holy books should really only be used as guidelines.
However, that doesn't mean I am any less a part of my religion.
I also think allowing the government to be based on religion can make controversial topics even worse to discuss.
That's not saying that Basim's family didn't mean anything to him, but the fact that he was able to forgive after being wronged so badly is extremely noble.
Since 9 11, people in America have been scared of Muslims because Americans started to stereotype all Muslims as radical Muslims, even though the majority of Muslims are peaceful people like Basim.
However, I do agree that everyone should pursue the religion they feel most connected with especially since that is everyones right in the United States.
I also know that forgiveness is something that is important in the Christian Bible, but it is one of those things that is so much easier said than done.
But could you imagine if all the people who called themselves Christian and Muslim could forgive like Bassim how different everything would be.
I always thought that I was accepting of all cultures but I realized that easier said.
When Sam invited the girls wearing Hijabs to the front to be interviewed I realized that I had never asked a Muslim these questions.
If I am so accepting how did I not know these things or at least ask someone.
But seeing those girls in front of the class I realized just how open they were to the questions.
When Sam tried to high five one of the girls they looked at him like he was crazy.
This was something I just never knew and I was so surprised.
But when Sam brought up the point that it is special connection between a man and woman when the woman saves herself only for you, I really connected to that.
In this video, Sam talked about how there is no way for him to teach us all about others cultures and everything going on around the world, but he can instill a greater sense of empathy and the ability to see a situation from another persons point of view.
Because of this, it is important to view others with an open mind and not judge them for their beliefs.
I come from an upper middle class suburban area, so spending time in the city of Oakland was quite the change.
At my school, it was very expected for people to graduate so I never really thought it was a big deal, but at this graduation kids were ecstatic to be graduating, dancing down the carpet to get their diplomas.
As Chinese who have learned about this part of history, the nation hated Japan for decades.
Even hearing the accounts of others who have had these experiences is eye opening.
How they made women wear veils, men having to cut their pant to a specific length above the ground, and not letting women drive, etc.
I respect their opinion on wearing the hijab and their reasons behind it.
When we were talking to Rafi, Im not going to lie, I thought that Sam brought him into class since he such a great person.
I thought he wanted to show us this one great Afghan since Rafi is such an impressive individual.
I do not regret following my faith and am glad it has been a part of my life and upbringing, but I do feel that people should have more of a say in their beliefs rather than parents guiding the whole thing.
I have learned some through this class, but I really wish I can hear voices from all parties.
Islamaphobia is rampant in the media today, and this video really showed me how some Christian groups are responsible for the same heinous acts.
Being Muslim and Pakistani is difficult due to the biased view that people have.
A lot of people are selfish in the way that they only are concerned with things that involve them.
so I think that we should take Bassim's advice and try to educate ourselves.
I usually feel so lost when people talk about other world issues that are currently happening because I do not take the time to watch the news and pay attention to other parts of the world.
I also want to learn more about the war because I barely know anything.
Having conversations with others that do know what is going on is so confusing and frustrating for me.
I think that they are just like anyone else, but they just ended up getting a bad reputation.
I definitely agree with the argument you make in this response to the lecture video clip.
Christian Sharia law is absolutely absurd and, as the video clip explains, simply cant be done effectively, as a small book like the Bible just cannot cover everything needed to govern every aspect of every day life.
Basim is such an inspirational person and I admire him for his values and the way he has handled his situation.
When he first told us about his story, I had to hold back my tears.
I have been so blind to all of the horror that goes on in the world, so it was shocking to me to hear what had happened to him and his family.
He teaches me that life goes on, and we must forgive and learn to be happy with the things we have.
To treat others with respect and love, and always forgive because I have been forgiven myself.
He is indeed strong and he has shown everyone his strength through this tragedy he went through.
I also like how he did not let this tragedy impact him for the rest of life.
I admire the fact that he did blame America as a whole for what the government did to his family.
Then again that is probably because he was here already and was already exposed to the good side of America.
I've always been away from religion since it is something that requires belief, and anytime someone's belief is challenge there is always a backfire or a fight that grows from it.
So what is happening to the Muslim community is the same thing.
If we as humans wish to continue and further ourselves in this world, on this planet that we'll need to actually record what is happening, and recollect the information that we've lost so we can prevent ourselves from repeating it.
Sadly, humans as well all are have to much pride in what we believe in so as long as we keep on believing we're right nothing will change and we'll kept repeating.
I've stated all I wish to state for this video response.
Though I guess I can add this at least, the world has been here for so long and yet we haven't progressed as much as we should have, 2000 years after whatever and we're still behind.
It is time that we stop generalizing all of these people and really look at their individual actions.
It is not fair to target an entire population when it was only a small group that committed the wrongdoing.
I do not know where he found it in him to forgive from such a horrible event that changed his everyday life; but I understand and am thankful of how he did find it in him to forgive.
We can see that there is a problem that people use the bible just to justify their actions.
As well as this whole objection of who is christian and who isn't.
The bible is giving events which other people have witness.
If people took the time to read the bible word for word 3 times over, they would still be confused and wouldn't have a solid answer in all honesty.
Like he said from his experience from living in England, they seem more aware of what is going on in the world than the people of the United States.
Like Bassim spoke about, this would help us learn about the world and understand that there is much more going on than solely what is happening in the United States.
Also, unlike the U.S. media portrays it, people around the world live similar lives to us in the U.S. and have the same ambitions, a point that was also made by Raffi.
This advice from Bassim was powerful and simple and if taken up by us in Soc119, I think that it will bring positive change.
I have known and understood that innocent lives are loss, but reading those facts and statistics make everything so distant...unconnected.
Many people at times do not even support what our government does with it.
Along with the fact that he had lived here and had friends here, in the states, who he knew werent the evil those bombs projected us to be.
To put this into perspective I think about the 9 11 attacks, although I did not lose anyone personally, we all grew up with our country at war with the enemy.
They are just like us however people in their country are and have been making some evil and terrible decisions in their lives.
I know I could never relate to what Basim is and has gone through but the idea of goodness and regular people in his country exist.
These are the two places that I care most about.
I feel that I would have a better and broader perspective on the world if I had care more about the other parts of the world.
To the best of my understanding, I believe that he is asking us to be more caring about the people living outside the countries we know of.
These people live in countries that are considered war zone to the majority of population.
However, they are all human and live like we do despite the slight difference between us.
The media is a fantastic tool that can be considered as window to the world.
If we take the time and make good use of the media, we can know more about the other parts of the world and be more understanding about what is happening around the planet.
And instead of allowing them to do this, we are interrupting their live, not really for the danger we feel, but the resources we want.
That is crazy to think about; really I mean could you imagine that a nation would bring war to your country so that they could profit of your resources.
It was really cool to see the paradigm shift from this idea of an oppressive culture, into this the hijab being a sense of protection that allows you to be more confident in who you are.
It is absurd how we dont think of groups like the KKK being Christian but when we think of Isis all we think about is islam.
In order to have more peace we need look at every angl before making executive actions that can ruin others lives.
So the fact that you are moved by that and are educating yourself is great.
They look at us the same way we look at them.
For us to talk about Muslim terrorists such as ISIS and associate them with the religion of Islam, we also have to talk about the Ku Klux Klan and associate them with Christianity.
They are the same radical people, with the same radical views only that they are directed towards a different group of people.
But it is necessary for us to understand each other as humans and as people of different origins and backgrounds.
Professor Richards brings up the topic of trying to get us to look through the eyes of the Islamic people, and think how they must feel about the Christian religion.
I agree with this part of lecture tremendously because I feel that most people dont understand that Americans tend to somewhat block out all the negatives that come from Christians because the United States is heavily populated with them.
If they were to look at themselves through another lens, they would see that there is plenty of violence and issues being raised by many other religions other than just those of Islamic descent.
Leading up to Basims skype call, we were introduced to him through a series of slideshows giving us a little background about his life.
I admire Basim for going on with his daily life.
I think it was so brave of him to be able to tell a class of 700 Americans what our country ultimately did to his family and life.
Basim calmly responded that he does not hate America for what they have done.
He knew the people he met here were not evil or out to seek any harm against any other country.
It is upsetting however, to think that many of us dont personally know an Afghanistan, or a Muslim, or an Islam, ect.
I think it is safe to assume that far more of these cultures travel to the US for various reasons.
This makes me think an even bigger divide in America and other countries are solely based on religion, being as America is a predominately Christian country.
However, it is obvious that Basims religious beliefs in the situation helped him move passed hating us.
It is hard to put yourself in his shoes, but if this happened to any American I think we would struggle a lot to try and not hate that country, I at least know I would.
If Basim was able to seek religion in a time of need to prevent his hatred I think it is embarrassing that some Americans hate his country without anything nearly as personal happening to them.
Gabriella, I have taken away from Sam's lectures many of the same ideas that you have.
Since taking this class, I've realized that I know little to nothing about what goes on in other countries and other parts of the world.
In the past class Sam brings up a good point about how there is a lot of Islamic phobia and distortion of how we see things and how he tries to shape his lectures to show us students a different lens of perspective.
First of all, I do think that it is necessary for this class to change and evolve over time as the world and the society is ever changing.
Only by absorbing and implementing new elements from the latest trend can we learn about race and ethnicity issues around the world.
Also you mentioned about moments when Sam talks things that truly open up your mind.
As an international student, I do not feel as surprised when he shouts out to the American students in the class.
Since society is always adapting to new things it is important that people do not always reference the bible to every little thing and decision that life brings.
Mostly everything that I hear about that is related to this country is something very negative.
I guess I take my own life for granted.
He has a wife and children who he is responsible for.
They are no different than us except for the fact that they reside in a country that is constantly at war.
Rafi wants peace in the world and will do whatever he can to find that.
I want to help him find peace so that one-day his children never have to worry.
A lot of people think Christianity and Islam are different, but they are strikingly similar.
Shining the light on this hypocrisy was refreshing to see in class because I think a lot of students dont realize how unfair it is to only label Muslims as bad people, when in fact Christians commit some heinous crimes in the name of God.
I also agree with you that church and state must be separate, I wish to see this happen in my home country of Pakistan.
We should most definitely not allow ourselves to just assume these negative views on Sharia Law because it is what the general population does, but instead look deeper into what it promotes and the meaning behind it.
I am a young American woman, but more than that I am a jewish young woman.
Basims reaction to if he hated Americans, is similar to how I feel regarding the question, do I hate Germans.
It is very interesting to see how powerful religion can be, helping a man who lost everything in his life still find happiness and peace in this world.
Thus, we have access to their personal blogs and can know their stories, rather than just learn about systematic facts from historic and geographical classes.
I am also impressed by the fact that he is willing to talk about this every year.
I agree when you talk about how a progressive nation became a backwards society and its difficult to understand.
At a certain point in time, the Prophet (peace be upon him) came to learn that there would be an assassination attempt on those who did not believe in Islam, so he and the fellow Muslims fled Makkah and made their way to another city named Madinah.
I feel the Quran is a good guideline to life, but only if you understand the context behind these lines in the book.
A lot of these lines do not apply in regular day to day life.
Instead of turning to religion or meditation, I began to plan my revenge, envisioning the satisfaction and ecstasy that would result from getting even through violent retribution of the person who wronged me.
In my experience, this train of thought is not worth driving for long because I could not legally or logistically achieve what I wanted to do.
It was very eye opening especially when it came to the misconceptions of people in Afghanistan.
Rafis reality is not something I expected.
I knew people lived there, but not until Rafi stood there talking did I fully comprehend that there were actual people out there who have nothing to do with the war.
We also tend to view things from a closeminded perspective and not look at the whole story.
People tend to make generalizations and classify all Muslims as violent killers, they associate this religion with violent actions.
Or why cant those Muslims that commit crimes be seen as fraudulent.
We also need easily accessible justifications, its really easy to say oh he just did that because hes Muslim or oh all Muslims do that.
It also is probably frustrating for those who are judged based off of their religion.
Thats also where the empathy part comes in, we need to look at things from a different perspective.
Many people who have been severely wronged lack the psychological wherewithal to only respond without violence.
My point is that, it's okay to hypothesize those ideal solutions, but we cannot forget or ignore the other, less ideal solutions many of us often turn to.
I thought that we might here from Basim and have try to convince us that life isnt all bad in Afghanistan, and that many, many people live what we perceive to be normal lives.
I never expected the twist that Sam dropped on us.
I couldnt imaging losing any of my family members even to old age, much less to a bomb from a foreign nation wanting my nations resources.
This talk really got me thinking about how war not only affects people directly in the war zone, but even outside of it.
Growing up in a Christian church I was told many things about religion, and the one thing that I always remembered was that following the bible is the best way to live.
My parents have set the foundation early for me when it came to religion.
From what I heard growing up there are many stories of Jesus and his men on different joineries.
I choose to stop going and I started seeing things that my parents were talking about.
Growing up following the Christian religion has been a good journey for me because I will always have faith in the lord.
The bible is just a cornerstone on how u should live your life and many different examples and stories that are interesting.
Jesus Christ, the son of God, or the Prophet Isa (peace be upon him) came with the Bible.
The Prophet Muhammed (may Allah honor him and grant him peace) came with the Quran and thats where another group split off, and that group is called the Muslims.
While there are parts of Sharia that refer to harsh punishments and other areas that seem very radical, most Muslims who use Sharia law as a template to go about their lives believe in the more moderate version, which is against unjust harsh treatment of others.
It is ludicrous how we have people in our own government crying out Sharia law and how it is a threat to our democracy, yet not having the slightest bit of understanding about what it is.
From a fundamental aspect, both the Bible and Quran are very similar in that both emphasize on treating others the way you want to be treated, forgiving others, not killing, etc.
They also both contain violence but we do not hear about the violent side of Christianity nearly as much.
There are many extremists who have carried out attacks in the name of their respective Gods but Muslims get scrutinized the most because that is who we hear the most about on the news.
You just never know what type of person is in the room.
If more people went out and experienced different countries then maybe they might have different opinions on those people.
One thing Americans tend not to do is travel outside of the country.
We are introduced to Basim Razzo who is a man who has lived through horrible misfortune.
But somehow someway Basim goes on and is not filled with hate.
The fact that he could get on a Skype call and talk to 700 american students that are from the country that changed his life for the worse is amazing and admirable.
Even though our country did something terrible to him he still shows us compassion and kindness from across the world.
Islam is a very peaceful religion and these violent acts are of those who are in the minority and call themselves Muslim.
If we could all learn a little from how Basim approaches his grief and learn from his compassion it would make great strides our country.
We killed and destroyed his life.
I was surprised to see that women in Afghanistan have so many rights.
I don't think that it should matter where in the world you live.
I strongly believe one of those rights is to be able to get out of a relationship where you are being treated poorly.
I feel like for me personally I am catching myself checking up on the validity of news reporters.
Another aspect that makes it difficult for us to be like come on, that's a joke is that we're on the other side of the world.
Obviously if this were happening in the US we could easily discount this, but not being exposed to lifestyles in Afghanistan and the middle east really at all makes it so easy for us to fall into this trap of hanging off the media's every last word.
I saw that Richards was trying to get us to view issues from a different perspective.
I also enjoyed this segment of the class because open-mindedness is very important to me.
I feel as though we cant continue to make these blinded assumptions or speak on things that we know nothing about.
I think this is true regardless of where the violence happens.
When a muslim or someone of another religion commits a crime, they are automatically labelled a terrorist.
However, newspaper articles have shied away from this label, instead saying he had extreme values.
I enjoyed reading your post and I agree with everything you pointed out.
To me its not really a choice of when to wear it and I feel as though if you are going to practice that religion you should take it seriously.
The hijab is a symbol for Muslim women to cover their body form men who are not their husband.
Everybody is entitled to practice any religion they want to, its just up to them to keep their faith strong.
I also thought this was a super interesting topic in class.
If you really really love your religion why not live your life by its rules?
I wholeheartedly agree with everything you mentioned in your post.
It must be difficult when good-natured Muslims are being disparaged when someone of ISIS carries out a terrorist attack.
This statement made me think how big this problem has escalated just for the fact that nations are competing to own this natural resource.
Probably, if Iraq did not have this natural resource, the U.S. wouldn't be in this country and most of the wars could have been avoided.
Sam received a facebook message from him saying that U.S. soldiers had bombed his house and that he lost most of his family.
In a later Skype call we had with him, he mentioned how he saw no hope for Iraq becoming what is used to be before.
At similar tragedy happened in Panama in 1989 when the United States invaded Panama to take own the Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega.
This type of tragedies is what makes me think how short and harsh life is.
By taking time to educate classes like Soc 119 Basim is able to take a terrible thing that happened to him and make a difference with todays youth, who will hopefully magnify the change.
How in one second you could lose everything you love and stand for and that is why I think we should be thankful everyday for the life we have.I am from Panama and in 1989 we suffered a U.S. invasion.
I know that this advice really constructive because I am almost completely oblivious to our own government let alone the rest of the world.
That is very detrimental to people who want to learn about what is going one but get skewed information and are misleaded into thinking a certain thing without being about to form an opinion on their own.
I also will be sure to see what is truly happening and not getting brainwashed by the media.
People will take the same exact reading and interpret it in multiple different ways; some people kill others over it, some people abstain from certain activities, some people eat certain things, etc.
I think it boils down to the person and how they choose to translate what theyre reading.
I think that a lot of issues and events happening in the world between different countries and religions stem down to the individual person committing these crimes or participating in these events.
I thought about this during my group meeting too and in my opinion its also how I view the whole black lives matter issues and the police brutality issues.
So it makes me question, how can people participate in some of these things and then swear against others?
And how can some people use some of these things as a guideline to murder others, and discriminate against others?
Another thing that is important to understand is the fact that the world is constantly changing and evolving.
One thing I agree on is the fact that we need to take a closer look into other religions and races.
Being a white female, I have grown up to be accustomed to the norms of my specific religion.
Also, the idea that only Islamic groups have caused terrorism is not right.
We are taught specifically that only people from certain places can cause such harm.
I like learning about the world from a different perspective.
I think everybody was wondering the same thing Stacey asked and I am sure Basim had responded to the question several times before.
The reason for this is what caught my attention and left me thinking and reflecting.
He actually had had good experiences with Americans in the past so why should he hate them.
That is something his religion taught him and encouraged him to do, forgive, just like in my religion (Christianity).
I agree that there are a lot more similarities between the religions that we may not realize.
I also want to emphasize when you say if we take the chance to learn about them.
When he was explaining what had happened to him and his family, I put myself in his position and all I could imagine was the intense burning anger I would feel.
I would not necessarily hate the United States, even though a big part of the blame would be on them.
Additionally, people tend to lump both Arabs and Muslims into one same category, when in reality being Muslim is a religious belief and Arabs are people that come from the Middle East.
I was glad that I got to hear Basim speak about his lifestyle and the way that he goes through his life every day.
He lives a regular life, consisting of work and taking care of his family much like many Americans.
It is important to understand that we can not marginalize and create stereotypes of groups of people without first trying to learn and understand how they live their life.
Our religions are more similar than we thought.
If we all realized that, there may not be as many wars.
It is horrible that different cultures see each other in different ways because of their beliefs.
I feel that if I had a book with stories that establish my laws, I would not follow them.
While in America, people who did not lose anything personally in 9 11 use their religion and religious differences to hate others.
I am angry with America, but I have so much to learn from Bassim.
How do you forgive people who seem to hate you?
It is hard to hate someone who you truly know.
The more you get to know someone the more you build empathy and understanding.
Hate comes from not knowing another person.
He was able to connect with this man, person to person and he started to relinquish his hate.
With these stories in mind, it is imperative that each and every one of us continue to push ourselves to meet people from all over the world with all different backgrounds because connecting person to person is the best way to dispel hate and build empathy.
To truly forgive this country, one must understand the suffering and struggles of those who turn to this hate.
Picciolini said he sees people in these hate groups as broken people with underlying problems, struggles, and suffering that led them to a life of hate.
But if we do not try to do so, we are no better than the hate groups themselves, because we are hating others without connecting with them as people.
With this empathy, we must build relationships that change minds or support those who can like Picciolinis organization Life After Hate.
As a country, we believe that our past few presidents are drastically different from each other and represent vastly different ideas.
Basam has said that many administrations have promised to help with issues that his community faces.
But, each administration has not followed through on these promises.
This may not be a well known fact to many Americans because what we hear about our presidencies is very much focused on ourselves.
If we follow through on our promises, we could possibly help a war zone become a community that fosters education and hope.
It may also help to create a new worldly perspective on the impact of politics.
Personally, I didn't realize the damage that not only ISIS was creating but also damage created by the United States.
I also never knew about all the changes that ISIS brought upon parts of the middle east.
This leads me to believe that there is hope, but I'm sure Basim knows better than me.
Also, another question I had was in relation to headdresses.
Basim said that ISIS made women wear them, so why do women continue to wear them if they are no longer being controlled by ISIS.
For example, if a Muslim woman is in the US why would she wear the headdress.
Before ISIS not all women wore it so why wear it if you know it was mostly an idea coming from a radical perspective?
I think that we tend to put racial groups (people) in a box because it makes it easier to judge people without even knowing them.
He understands that it is not the people's fault and that what happened to him was a result of a very minute group of people.
Here in the United States after the events that took place on September 11, the populationsperceptions of people from the Middle East shifted into negative, hateful thoughts.
Nobody sought to understand that what happened that day was a result of a very small portion of people and that the whole country does not share the same mindset and values.
I like the controversial topics that we talk about and how we do not have to be politically correct because it makes it so much easier to talk about these issues and see the different points of views of people in a more open way.
I think that some issues I really have been able to empathize with people that couldnt have before because I hadnt thought about the ideas that Sam brings up.
Everyone has their own right to interpret the bible in their own way but they do not have the right to be ignorant of how those interpretations hurt our society.
I think that now more than ever society needs to see that religious teachings need to be modernized.
By modernizing it, we may be able to eliminate some of the hate that is directed towards people who do not fit into the mold of what the bible says a person should be.
Not everyone takes the teachings of the bible and overtly does hateful things but their beliefs could be teaching the next generation that people that are different are wrong.
I always thought that people in hijabs would be shyer or less confident but to my surprise, it is the total opposite accordingto the girls we met).
Even if we do not change our beliefs, it is always good to understand someoneelse's and see where they are coming from.
People are very judgemental and I instead of focusing on how all our religions are different we need to look at how they are similar and use them to accept people and not judge them.
As a Chinese international student in America, I always found it interesting that despite the fact that we enjoy technology in our daily life, most of us are not aware of what is happening around the world.
The big data analyze everything about us and feed us the things that we might be interested in.
What if we in fact are not exposed under new information at all?
It was my first time to meet and talk to someone from Iraq, suffered from great loss, and managed to survive the tragedy.
It was beyond my imagination that he can truly forgive the ones who have taken everything from him.
Then I realize that it was his religion that gives him the power to forgive and move on.
He believes that there is a written ending for everyone, including his daughter, wife, and brother.
Every war has a reason, most of them relate to interest, like power, money, and resource.
However, speaking to a real person, who lost almost everything in this chaos, was both mind-blowing and heat-shaking.
Many years ago, his wife and daughter were killed in a miscalculated bombing by the American military.
If I were in his position, the sadness and pain that I would have felt would have transferred into a deep anger for America.
The rage that would have been built inside me would have caused me to want to take extreme measures against the US to get them back.
However, Bassim, as he stated and showed through his calmness in a Skype chat, is no longer angry at America.
His mindset was one that I decided to share with my parents.
She experienced moments where she would be thrown out of her home and have all her familys belongings taken from her.
This is a hatred that has never escaped her.
She explains to me that if I had only experienced what she has, I would feel the same way.
I have absolutely no idea what she must have gone through.
All I have are stories.
However, in hearing from Bassim, I decided to give it one more shot.
Though they maintain their level of dislike towards many groups of people, I am confident that they are beginning to realize that the hate they feel is only tearing away at their own souls.
It was designed so that religion would not influence it.
I want my government to be based around factual information on the healthiest decisions for people and the smartest diplomatic relations as opposed to what the bible says to do.
Not hate the country that ruins your entire life.
His religion tells him to forgive and he always uses his religion as a life guide.
But the Japanese government never admits the massacre and even try to obliterate the history.
This is basically the reason why the relationship between China and Japan is always very intense.
But I would never forget the history.
When Basim told us the story about his house being destroyed by the United States and they offered him $1,500, I felt embarrassed to be an American at that moment.
We took this man's entire life and turned it upside down and then we said here were sorry, how does an insignificant amount of money sound?
I understand that there are accidents in the military, especially when it comes to dropping bombs from hundreds of feet in the air, but we never stop and analyze the effects it has on civilians on the opposite side.
There would not be world peace, but definitely a decrease in the number of war-related deaths.
So then I thought to myself maybe if he sees no difference in how the presidents and their administration conduct business, it could be because they are not the ones making the daily decisions.
I led myself to another dead end but then Basim made another comment.
So, all he saw of the world were the shadows of the townspeople that crossed it.
He went back to his friends in the prison to explain what he saw but they could not understand because they have always been living in darkness.
This relates to us today because all we know of the world is what we experience in our environment.
Therefore, we can only assume what the world is like based on our society.
With that comes the risk of a twisted perception of the outside world and an inability to acquire a full understanding of what the world is like.
For example, professor Richards gave us an example of how twisted our reality is of Muslim countries.
The only way in which we can truly discover what reality is and understand a culture is by getting out of the darkness and experiencing reality ourselves.
Then I realized that he was only one of many that are affected by these unfortunate circumstances.
The only reason why I did not see how much of a big deal this was in the past was because I have been living in the darkness.
I believe it takes a very open minded person to realize that if he were to continue to be angry, he would only hurt himself more.
Having Basim come speak in our class was something I will never forget and listening to him talk made me feel so many different emotions.
The event that happened to Basim was a heartbreaking, devastating tragedy and it is inspiring how he can still have such a hopeful outlook on the future.
I knew that the Quran was used as a guide to law making, but I did not think much about it other than that.
As a Catholic, I understand what Sam is saying when he talks about interpretation of the Quran or the Bible.
With true equality, even our government and law would value other religions over what the majority thinks is the superior.
After the battle, around eight hundred thousand of citizens have currently fled their homes as a result of fighting in Mosul, but some of them decided to go back to their country because they want to contribute and serve for the country.
He told us that he was in the house with them at the time of the bombing and he was standing only two feet away from his wife, but his life was spared.
He told us about how when he lived in the US for eight years he became friends with many Americans and they were all good people, but he said that the problem is with the US government.
Furthermore, I have never detached myself as a citizen of the United States and thought about how from outsiders, they may think that what is happening here is very similar to what is happening in places being controlled by radical believers of different religions.
It was Bassim's religion that helps him to withdraw from sorrow, and move on.
But this is the first time to realize the power of religion and faith.
Nearly every person in the world has acted in some way against the Bible.
As Sam Richards said, even soliciting is against the Bible.
I can almost guarantee that the people that claim to be acting in Gods wishes have gone against the Bible one way or another.
For all we know, God could have meant to make soliciting the worst sin in human history.
In this video we started class talking about the effect and reasoning behind the United States intervention in the Middle East after 9 11.
We said that the reason for us going into Iraq was that we were worried they had weapons of mass destruction.
One such person was discussed in class and even connected with the class via Skype call.
He lived in Mosul with his family and lived a happy life.
However, once the conflict reached this part of Iraq it started to take the toll that war takes on all areas.
Basim was also badly injured in the strike and needed months of recovery.
This is just one story of many in this continued conflict that has reshaped a whole country.
After about 8 years, Basim and his wife moved back to Iraq where they started their family.
We learned that Basim had a daughter and son.
This did not make any sort of news, perhaps because things like this have become normalized in a country that is a war zone.
A house and material things can of course be replaced but Basim can never replace the loved ones he lost so violently.
I personally had been asking him this in my head.
When I face adversity, even if it is not to the degree of Basims trauma, I will remember a middle-eastern man with old fashioned glasses who spoke so brilliantly about how to push on when life feels like it is over.
I agree with the way you describe Basim as a role model because I have never encountered someone who has gone through so much and was able to live life without hatred and anger.
I think it is so easy to take the bad that life gives you and turn it into pain or hatred, but the way Basim was able to turn it into forgiveness and find purpose in his life.
I also agree that a major part of his ability to mve forward was his son and I think it is really beautiful how much love he has for his son after all the tragedy the two of them faced.
If Americans were to travel out of their comfort zone and educate themselves more on worldly issues, we would not be as nave and only think about what is happening in the United States, but we would expand our knowledge.
We are happy to live life in the bliss of ignorance, but in reality knowing multiple cultures can lead to greater success.
If we recognize the people of other countries, and recognize their worth and abilities there would be a better connection between a lot of people.
I remember being scared of Afghanistan people and treating them differently because in my mind they were very different from me.
Now I know that they are not that different from me, especially after everyone that Sam has brought to speak to us about the Afghan people.
You should definitely reach out to other countries and try to understand them and not be ignorant to what is happening outside of your own country.
I like how mentioned that the hate they feel is tearing away their souls, because if you can't forgive on the inside it will eat you alive and I learned a lot from watching that video as well reading about your personal story.
However, I do not think that religion should play a role in our government.
For starters, the separation of church and state was created so that no ruling body had a religion backing it because this would lead to the same problems that caused people to go to America to escape religious persecution.
We do not really hear the perspective of someone in the middle east, especially a person who had family killed because of the war.
I think having Basim tell his story was something that needed to be done, this is because as Sam said, a mistake was made with the coordinates of the air strike and it this mistake lead to a deadly result.
Also, not once did Basim say that he hates the American people, there is a stigma that goes around where Americans think all Middle Eastern's want to harm them but that is clearly not true.
If a man who had lost his loved ones due to an American airstrike says he does not hate the American people, I am sure there are many more like that out in the world too.
Like is it just a human nature thing to have the drive to find a way to move on even when a person has lost so much?
It also leads me to question if people of any faith background would have a bit stronger resolve to forgive and move on from terrible tragedy than a person who doesnt really have faith in any religion.
Its scary to think about how everything you care about can just go up in a flash like that.
Many Americans have solid perspectives on the world shaped to the taste of the media that the United States chooses to express.
The idea that you can be completely unbiased towards something that has been highly flagged in American culture is hilarious.
Because that's the worst lie anyone can ever tell.
The importance of being brutally honest so others may relate with you on ignorance and to stand up is key to further progressing as a nation.
The weird thing about this lecture is that people attempted to be so cool with each other even though they know their views have completely diverse points.
I also thought it was interesting that Basim said that his religion tells him to forgive others.
While he does have a problem with the United States government, Basim understands that not all people living in the United States are a reflection of their leaders.
It was scary seeing such a normal persons life change for no reason other than because he was an Iraqi.
I agree with you when you say that everything can change in just one day, so we need to live everyday like it is our last.
I have never thought of the U.S. involvement in that way.
I wonder what other factors would have contributed to our troops being in Iraq in addition to oil.
Sam explained that people interoperate the Bible in all different ways, which is true.
Another point Sam made was arguing about the bible and laws.
Some people believe they can do certain things or act a certain way because of how they interrupt the bible.
The bible is commonly interrupted in so many ways.
For example, the picture shown in class with the woman holding signs negatively referring to our soldiers.
To her, the bible made her think that all soldiers should go to hell.
At the end of the day you cant change the way someone believes in something.
I think its important for everyone to understand the ideas Sam was speaking about.
Hearing Basim speak was not only something inspiring, it was also needed due to how many people are unaware of what happens outside of this country.
I think that Americans need to hear more stories like this because we truly do not grasp the horrors that go on from this war.
Basim's story has to be one of many where someone had lost their family and everything due to the bombing and raids that happen on their home front.
I could not believe that the US could do that to innocent families, even though what they did was an accident.
This war has completely destroyed the whole city and the construction of the whole will take much longer than we expected due to lack of resources.
The idea that we are built off and enclosed by the ideas around is should be the main motivation of leaving.
I agree with the point you made about not being able to follow every single rule the Bible writes out for us.
I think this class and this video opened up the idea that all religions are equally different as much as they are the same.
The option is there, so the fact that some Christians fight so hard for bring god back into the classrooms is absurd.
Sams friend who came in to speak to us really touched me when he expressed how much he loved his wife and family.
Men in the middle east are usually portrayed by the US to be uncaring and not loving to their wives so it was eye opening for me to here this man say he would never divorce his wife because of their deep love.
because growing up I used to be angry with people all the time, until I also realized the same thing as Basim.
One time when I was in 10th grade there was a kid named Austin who I got into a fight with.
While I thought it was worth it to hold a grudge, I alike Basim realized that you must live with what happened because all the anger that we hold inside will practically destroy ourselves.
After days and days of being mad when I saw Austin, I started to think of I should not let the fight that happened cause this much pain to me.
The anger I held against him was much worse than the physically damage done in the fight.
I now try to keep this in mind any time I get upset with anyone because ultimately it will all end up the same way.
From my American perspective I do believe that ever since 9 11 the United States has been very critical of anything associated with Islam.
I find it funny that you say that Americans do not find Sharia Law to be a good thing simply because it is a word that is associated with Islam.
I also find it interesting that you see faults in Sams lecture.
However, I feel that Sam gets an A for effort for trying to explain such a complex issue in such a small amount of time.
As a Muslim in the US, I noticed this from a young age that if theres any act of violence the attention given to the perpetrators religion increases significantly if they are Muslim compared to if theyre Christian.
If the perpetrator is Christian they tend to focus on other reasons as to why they did what they did but if theyre Muslim they tend focus way more on the entire Islamic religion.
I remember talking to my friend this week about the hijabi lecture we had this week and how amazing I thought it was and she started asking me questions about it.
Like, I feel like she is going to be less likely to be one of those people that believes everything being said about Muslims in the news because she now knows a little bit more about the religion and customs.
The video that I will be responding to is Introducting Basim Razzo.
And Sam kind of pushes it aside as not being one of the main reasons.
But then we saw everything that happened to those things, they were all destroyed.
If this was me I would have been unbelievably mad at the US and anyone that lives in the US for taking away everything important to me.
Bosims story really shows all of the senseless killing that occurs in war.
Even with his son still being alive, I dont know if Id be able to keep going for fear of losing him too.
He said that at first he was completely numb for months, but eventually he became angry.
He said that the anger ate at his heart, and he grew tired of being angry over things he couldnt control.
I thought his response was very human, he said it was all he could do.
People whose children died by the hands of men thousands of miles away that they have never met.
While there are thousands of people rightfully upset, there are probably even more thousands of people who have let go of their anger towards America.
People just like Bossom, who had no choice but to let go of the anger inside of them, and continue living their lives.
How much consideration are these people given when the US government is making important decisions?
When congress decided toinvade Iraq to look for weapons of mass destruction, of which there was questionable evidence of, did they consider that their actions would destabilize the regions for decades to come, resulting in the deaths of thousands of people?
Take for instance divorce, just as Sam discusses he says how it continuously says that this is how someone should divorce, even though that it is not the case.
It doesn't even have to deal with divorce; people just try to interpret the Bible in a way that it seems somewhat controlling of others lives.
Sam says it is subject to interpretation but still, some that use the Bible or those that use the Quran try to use it to create a society that they believe is the correct way to live.
I was expecting a very angry, hurt person.
What was the most beautiful surprise ever is that he was the total opposite.
The way he answered the first question was one of the most powerful answers I have ever heard.
The way he has come to forgiveness and let's love guide his life is something only an extraordinary person could do.
I try to think the way Bassam does in my own life.
If only people recognize this things could have turned out differently for Bassam.
I have so much respect for his strength, I hope in the future we can have more Bassam's in the world.
Regardless of your political views, I think it would be almost impossible to find someone you know who really likes all three.
And maybe if everyone could come as relatively close to experience the perspective of Basim as we did, things would be different.
I feel like this can also be applied to the tensions mounting with North Korea.
Our president is willing to end the world over some petty insults.
Just as people think that Muslims run their country with their religion, I don't think people ever think about how some of those high up in American government try and run our country based on their religion, which is most likely any of those under Christianity (mainly Christian faith).
For instance, people that try and create laws to stop abortion because they believe it is murder.
I learned many things about women who wear them and I find to have so much new found respect for them too.
I also never knew that they take it off only when they are indoors with other women.
I also admire the respect they have for themselves especially around men.
This has been the lecture that impacted me the most.
I was thinking about the companies I wanted to talk to and other things related to securing to an internship.
Even though I was paying attention to Dr. Richards lecture, I was very anxiously sitting there.
I was in absolute shock and felt so bad when listening to the story.
Immediately after that, I noticed that both screens went black and I thought some technical issue had occurred with the projector, and that is when Mr. Bassim appeared live on our projector.
When Mr. Bassim was skyping the class, one of the students asked him why he doesn't hate the US.
I was so touched about how calm and forgiving Mr. Bassim is.
This lecture has not only shown me the unjust in this world but it also put me into a lot of self-reflection.
Most of my life I always thought of it as being a very oppressive thing meant to put down women but perhaps it really isnt that.
Now you could argue that women over there do not want to drive themselves at all but that seems to be a pretty large generalization.
Im sure the truth lies somewhere in the middle, but for now it is certainly hard to see.
I think it is very easy for us in America to be caught up in our own country and forget about all the other people there is in the world.
For me personally, before when I heard about a country like Basim's I never thought there could be many similarities between me and the people who live there.
With that mindset I was missing out on learning about some really great people.
Secondly, I thought this video really spoke to me because it is advice that I need to take myself.
After sitting in on lectures and reading various news articles from class, my mind and point of view changed about how I and other should be more invested in what is going on in the world.
But when other things happen in other countries that are far more important or to be considered real news, it takes us way longer to hear about, and react about it.
I would like to take Bossims advice and apply it to my own life.
Whenever Sam started talking about Iraq and Mosul, I knew that I had no prior knowledge to the situation he was about to explain.
But now the city looks different, as the United States has broke the system (Sam, 3:15).
The educational system, societal system and cities have been broken by the United States, and I never knew about it.
So when this information was presented to me I felt sorry for all of the individuals involved in the chaos in Mosul.
He was a colleague of Sam's that lived in Mosul.
He had done some of his school in the United States, but his family lived in Mosul.
His family had a very nice house, and so did his brother and his family.
At that point I was curious as to how Basim could cope with his everyday life knowing that another country took his loved ones away.
I come from a catholic family, went to catholic schools but never took the bible seriously enough to think it could be compared to sharia law.
Sam shows us that different people have different interpretations on the bible.
And a key takeaway from this is most westerners find sharia law to be crazy.
For many years doing things that were frowned upon by religion would be considered a crime and consequences would be paid for such attitudes.
The things is that today many of those things that were frowned upon once are not anymore.
However, talking about this thing with my grandmother is completely different.
He showed forgiveness even to those who doesnt deserve it.
I deeply agree with him because being in such a globalized modern society I feel like we dont take advantage of the opportunities we have of learning from other cultures and experiences of people different than us.
Knowledge is not something we only learn in books or its not only measured by grades.
That is why I am so deeply engaged on Sam Richards class, I feel like he gives us knowledge that goes beyond the textbooks.
Being able to hold a conversation with girls who wear a Burka and for them to eliminate any type of stigma we had about why they use it was so eye-opening and interesting.
Most other Penn State classes are the same thing year to year and lack the same level of engagement that soc 119 has.
I am replying to Sam's monologue about empathy and how if we say the kkk and other radical christian groups are not Christians, then how can we say the radical Muslims are Muslim.
I completely agree with everything he's saying about how you can not generalize a whole religious group based on the actions of a small minority.
You can't say all college kids are alcoholics just because some of us like to drink on the weekends.
You must show them and really make them understand how foreign people are no different than us.
When speaking with Basim Razzo the entire room was captivated.
Despite being from the middle east and a part of a religion that so many Americans have an irrational fear for, everyone was able to feel his pain through his story.
Many American students here at Penn State, including myself, have never gone outside our comfort zone and really pondered what it is like to be in a country that is not the United States of America.
Regarding foreign policy, specifically war, I believe that our efforts in Iraq are proactive towards creating a peaceful and stable nation while perhaps more importantly at the same time protecting our best interests.
While there is always room for improvement and the use of different tactics that could have still can be used, I believe that the United States leaders are doing the best they can in a hostile, foreign government.
Sometimes, we tend to get so caught up in our own world, like thinking that having three exams in one week is like the end of the world.
Even at the living conditions that seem so unthinkable to the rest of the world, they still aim to thrive in their lives.
On top of this I always thought that people within the same social class married one another.
The only reason I thought this is from movies I have watched and articles I have read in the past.
The viewpoint of marriage in this area is most likely misconstrued to the general public and most people probably have the same thought process as we did.
Marriage is a big deal and if you're forced to marry someone that you don't want to be with for the rest of your life, you will most likely not be happy at all.
I know that the different presidents have had various effects on the status of war in the United States.
When Basim Razzo expressed his opinion on the different presidents effects on his home it was eye opening.
My own ignorance lead me to think further into all that I do not know.
I thought about everything I believed because of my liberal status.
Growing up I was raised in a very liberal family, which lead me to share such beliefs, like many kids.
I agreed with everything that they believed.
Now I have these beliefs because I am able to formulate my own opinions, and research them so I can have a better understanding of the topics.
I was, and relatively still am, ignorant to what I do not agree with.
I always assumed Obama would be trying to make that region safer, but I was wrong.
This also applies to specifically to Americans who love to see all of the positives in the country and never point out the negatives, but instead judge other countries for what theyre doing.
We must be more willing to discuss the problems happening within the country not only so they can be fixed but also so we can all recognize that we have a lot in common with many other countries in the world.
I think a way we could combat this is by trying to expose more people to different cultures and showing how we really are all very similar.
Because once you put people in the same room and make them have a discussion it becomes very easy for them to see their similarities.
Compassion and kindness should not be something that is limited to a certain group, a certain community, or a certain religion; they should be unconditional with no buts or limits.
I really like how you related this class lecture to what you were learning about in your other class.
Like you stated about your prior knowledge the same went for me, I am not very religious but I atleast thought I knew certain things about the various religions but I seemed to be wrong.
Learning about the Sharia Law really made me think about how we tend to view things in negative ways when in reality they are really close to our beliefs.
For me this was a very interesting class, because as a muslim woman who only occasionally wears a hijab, I really like sparking up this conversation.
Senegal is a very religiously free country, its is 92% muslim, yet our president is a Catholic, and it has never been an issue.
Our government sometimes isnt even majority muslim and it never posed an issue to be even discussed.
However, when she came here (US) she faced backlash like I have never seen before.
I mean you have men in the US using religion to justify taking multiple wives I mean come on, thats just gross.
I never had any type of prejudice against Muslim women who wear Burkas, but I must confess I never understood why they used it.
Being from Brazil, a country who embraces showing off your skin ( Carnaval, thongs, and small bikinis), we actually share the same belief in a way that we consider our body a temple that belongs to us so we shouldn't be afraid of showing it.
America has been the predatory force in wars abroad in the Middle East since I can remember, and with American military personal, unrest in the region has been constant.
I think Basim is aware of this, and knows the best thing he can do is portray his culture in a positive light to break the stereotypes that are being forced onto the American people.
Terrorism is a very difficult thing to deal with as a country, but condemning an entire cultural group is extremely detrimental to progressing as a country and globally.
I strongly believe that a lot of our racial and ethnic issues in America stem from a lack of empathy, and if we just teach our future generations to put themselves in others shoes, we could more easily fix the social problems in our country.
During that time in life I did not really understand religion, but I knew that I was Catholic.
Then When I was around 10 years old I stopped going to church, and started saying I was spiritual rather than religious.
So I believe that there is some type of greater being force, but I would not necessarily say it is God.
During high school I learned about Buddhism and thought that that was the religion I wanted to follow.
Then I experimented with being a Pagan, but that was not successful either.
However, it is very evident throughout history the lengths to which this country will go to gain access to resources abroad.
He needs money to rebuild his life.
I don't even know if I would be able to feel at that point.
Such a thing is unimaginable to me, because I've known safety all my life.
But for so many in war stricken countries, that is their reality.
The fact that Basim overnight lost basically everything he ever cared about yet is still able to have such a positive outlook on life is crazy to me.
He went on to explain that since he happened to survive that night, that it is obvious to him that god wants him on this earth and has a plan for him.
Basim is truly an inspirational figure, I just wish Basims story was spread around more so others could learn about this amazing man.
I mean I don't know how easily I would forgive say, someone who ruined my favorite shoes, yet these people have forgiven the country that practically destroyed theirs.
I also agree that the term America bashing is so silly.
We arent bashing by bringing those issues to light, if anything we are making the country better.
We also have to start holding leaders responsible for their roles in the continuance of all this destruction, I mean when are we going to say enough is enough?
At the same time, people work so hard to essentially cover up the atrocities committed by the Christian religion.
I never even considered the possibility of not being able to get a divorce if I wanted to, yet many men live with that unfortunate reality in Afghanistan.
I was so curious on why he didn't seem angry.
Basim was presenting himself so calmly and I truly couldn't understand why.
Many Americans have really negative beliefs on the Islam, and think it's a destructive religion just because they relate it to many radical groups.
If Basim can have his house bombed by the US government and still not build a prejudice about American people, than Americans should be able to get rid of their prejudice about people practicing Islam.
Its really good for you to collect information from different people.
I knew the news is sometimes not that objective to a subject, but I have to say Im often the one that looks at the newspaper and tends to believe them since this is the fastest way to know what things are happening around the world.
Sometimes it might challenge me about something Ive always thought it was real as well.
Lastly, I loved your point that we have the ability to help other people who are dealing with real issues on a daily basis.
Overall, I agree with many of the different points you have made.
Basim showed how courageous he is because despite the loss and the heartache, he moved on.
Basim does not generalize us, so why are we generalizing him?
We can all also learn from his policy of forgiveness.
He says his religion teaches him to forgive, however, we should not look at this as a religion-based quality.
Whether you are Christian, Muslim, Atheist, or anything in between forgiveness should be something we all practice.
It was inspiring to see how it picked himself up, rebuilt his life, and used his story to educate others.
If everyone could forgive like Basim did maybe the world would be moving in a slightly better direction.
Bassmins responses to all the students that had asked him questions amazed me.
Sam had him give our class advice but Bassmin did not want to consider it advice he just wanted us to actually do what he says.
He used an example that soldiers have not heard of Iraq before and that to me was astonishing.
I agree with Bassmin, we should start personal work and find things out on our own rather than depending on brainwashing social media.
It was extremely eye opening listening to what he thinks us as students should start doing.
Basim taught us all a very valuable lesson and that is forgiveness.
The comments you made about how you get mad at your parents and how you get angry over little things that arent that major, I completely feel you on that one.
I have so many dilemmas every week here at school that I think are the end of the world and that are going to ruin my life, but its really nothing compared to the big scheme of things going on in the world.
I cannot believe that if a man wanted to get a divorce, all they have to do is repeat talaq three times.
This is extremely simple, yet a woman has to go through the process of going through the court for a divorce.
This week I chose the video Bassim's Advice to the Class, and it really resonated with me.
And he continues to live life looking for justice, but not angry.
I truly thought that Afghanistan was a region inside of Iraq.
I am so ignorant of every other part in the world, and I don't think it's all my fault.
I think the US overall has some sort of mentality that like we shouldn't worry about places unless it involves us.
I saw something after the hurricanes that really struck me.
The kids were holding up a sign that read Praying for Texas or something along those lines.
These kids have absolutely NOTHING and went out of their way to show that they care and are praying for our country after a devastating catastrophe.
Thank you so much Haley for sharing your connection to the Iraq War.
The truth is your right and our country just wanted oil, and now for that reason people like Basim are suffering for it.
I also believe it will allow us to do more research on the cultures of other countries so we won't generalize cultures that may lead to prejudice.
Not just the class but how he too has evolved with it.
It definitely feels really good and not a lot of people are aware about what's happening in the world they live in and are surrounded by.
We as people should learn to believe and accept the kinds of people, religions and issues that come up and do our best to help or support it in every possible way we can.
I was not brought up religious so everything that your saying is new, interesting information to me.
However, I do know that many religious books are extremely contradictory depending on how you interpret what was written.
I respect Basim so much for being able to forgive the US for what happened to his family.
On top of that he basically teaches almost 800 people about compassion and it puts so much of our issues in perspective.
Like so many of the problems in my life are so little compared to his and even imaging the things that happened to him happening to me makes me want to cry.
He could have stayed angry at the US and it would have been justified but the fact that he decided that he wasnt is the most impressive thing to me.
I feel like many Christians are stuck on the fact that homosexuality is wrong because they turn a blind eye to the sins they are making all the time.
Knowing this makes me question how so many people can continue being judgmental of other peoples actions when they do not even take the time to evaluate their own actions.
Judging people in and of itself can be considered a sin but many people do not seem to care because they are so busy judging other peoples sins.
People who act this way are actually almost being hypocritical because they are accusing other people of committing these horrible sins but they are committing sins of their own at the same time.
I agree with you since neither did I have any prior knowledge about this and pretty much had the same ideas as you about this.
His life was pretty much destroyed, his family and beloved who comprised his life.
It's surprising to see how he dealt with this entire situation and was even able to forgive the people who were behind this.
I felt myself becoming angry and frustrated being in his position and what he went through.
As Bassim states in the video, it was a complete change of life for everyone in Iraq.
My heart really sunk when Bassim admitted at the end of the video that he is not optimistic for the future and he is not hopeful for the youth of Iraq as well.
I believe this is why Bassim wants to eventually go back to Mosul some day.
As Sam promised the week before, this was the best class of the semester -which is a lot to say, since most classes of SOC119 have been enlightening experiences.
For us, the foreigners, it was supporting evidence; an explanation to what we perceive.
Some powerful reflections arose from the debate, although it was more subdued than it could have been.
The Blacks own the system, which works on their behalf.
The programs instituted to level things out are making no noticeable difference.
I searched for statistics on demographic distribution for undergrad students in University Park campus discriminated by race ethnicity, and the most recent I found was for Fall 2016.
The fact that we were all there to hear is crucial towards making a more noticeable difference.
I guess that after so many years doing this, Sam no longer has the useless sense of urgency these statistics generate in me: I feel compelled to dwell on them longer, to spend another class or two making sure everyone saw it and comprehended it.
I would love to hear Sam speak of what he perceives is the impact of these lectures, if he sees a tangible outcome from his talks translated into the University Park community.
Because although we can't make an immediate difference in those numbers, we can get better at wearing each other's shoes, and translating this lecture into a lesson on Empathy.
I too could not fully understand why he was not angry at the United States at first, but once he explained it, I could relate.
Having cultural differences is okay, and I do believe that there are many similarities that all humans share, like you said.
I think Bassim gave us a lot to think about and I'm so happy I was able to experience it!
Although the disputing may never end, we are the only ones who can stop it.
It is no surprise that America has its share of unwanted events, but these events will never compare to those countries being destroyed by war.
It is very heart breaking that all of these horrible things are occurring because of the lack of ownership to our own resources.
There has to be a better wayto gain these resources.
I feel like there is a lot being covered up to make this place look good when in reality it is just building itself of the destruction of others.
I think that it is important that we call attention to the lack of sympathy being shown to those who are being affected.
I mean you can say that has happened here but just as much as we are hurting other countries are to and at the end of the day we are all the same.
It is no surprise how powerful America can be, but instead of using this power to kill why arent we using this power to unit and make the world a better place for everyone.
For many people forgiving is a hard thing for some people to do depending on the situation.
As Bassim said, you only have one life.
I will not forget the way he explained forgiveness, and will always keep it in my mind when I need to forgive.
What I found sad was how much the people have suffered and have be unable to fend off for themselves as they are put in between both the American and ISIS.
To them, they just want to live normal lives however are put in a position where they no matter what are being held at gunpoint by both sides.
For every time that ISIS strikes, a lot of innocent people are killed.
It was a sad conversation with Bossim to talk about how his family was killed by the people that are trying to help the situation.
In my opinion this would definitely end with more civilians dying than either side that is actually fighting in the war.
It has been infected by war and violence and truly feel sorry for the civilians of Iraq.
These horrific wars caused the deaths of many innocent people, and it is only in this course that I feel like I am truly gaining knowledge from both sides.
I particularly like the pictures that showed Mosul.
From the images of the University, to the shopping mall, to Basims middle class home, these pictures provided me with an insight about regular life in Iraq, making their destruction that much more real.
Before this class, I never thought about shopping malls in countries like Iraq or Afghanistan, but their existence is important in order to experience empathy towards those we often feel share nothing in common with us.
I particularly liked when you mentioned the part about how Christians do not see the KKK as Christians because they contradict some of the most important teachings of the Bible.
And also mentioning how Muslims that engage in extremist views are the same as the KKK as in that Muslims dont see them as Muslims because they break their religions code.
I found this part very interesting because I never thought of making that connection that people like ISIS are the Muslims version of the KKK.
Forgiveness is a virtue that many religions teach to be very important, but I am not sure many people would have reacted in the way Bassim did regardless of their religion.
I think it is a virtue that everyone should take more seriously because, you are right, the world would be a better place if people treated each other the way Bassim has and still does.
Life moves on even if you do not, so you might as well move on.
Obviously, Trumps statement is not factual because a lot of the Dreamers are contributing to the economy as well as serving in the army.
Just because a handful of them commit crimes does not mean that all of them need to suffer the consequences.
Also, Trump has recounted times where he sexually assaulted women and he has not faced the consequence of his actions, but he wants DACA individuals to pay for the actions of their parents.
I think one of the hardest things that Bassim had to do in a time like this was to be able to realize that life keeps going on and that if he kept this anger inside of him, it would eventually consume him.
I have so much respect for Bassim and the courage that he has shown since that devastating day in his life.
We live in a world where violence and tragedy is prevalent, but it isnt only because of one group of people.
I really agree with the stuff you mention here about the lecture changing my perspective.
I also never really knew how similar their lives were to ours.
When Sam went on to tell us about the bombing I was very taken back.
This lecture really made me sympathize with the people of Iraq for what they are going through.
I also thought that Bossom's attitude towards the American Government was extremely puzzling.
I tried to put myself in his shoes; as an Afghany man who's whole immediate family, brother and home were all murdered by a bomb sent by the US Government.
However, even sitting there unable to comprehend it, I could not imagine a situation where my anger would ever cease to exist.
Sam relating questions students have to his lecture was also really cool to me.
The empathy towards other races, religions, and other groups should be and needs to be the foremost thought of us as humans.
Not shown in the video is when Sam had some girls from class try on hijabs.
It does not make the individual person any different.
They are just practicing what they believe in and they have every right to do so.
I hope we can get to a point where people as a whole do not feel uncomfortable because someone chooses to wear a piece of fabric around their head.
Basim is very intelligent so that he realized that hate ate him from the inside.
But it is indignant to see that the United States government still does not take any action to improve Syrias battle or bring peace to this country.
Sometimes I think it is hard to understand why the government always tends to be a trouble maker.
The Japanese Fascists killed three hundred thousand ordinary Chinese people who did not have any arms to defend themselves.
I dont know if both Japan government and U.S government would be responsible for what they did to Chinese people and Syrian people.
Its sad to see how that can just be said and people must just take it for what it is.
So, if it's not anytime soon when will it be?
By this I mean that people will blame an entire religion or race for a problem situation that occurs.
Although the people who committed this attack did not represent the religion they followed as a whole, we still spread the blame around evenly.
I personally have a few Muslims in my family and am very close with one who is around my age.
Hi Brya, I also found this lecture to be extremely eye opening and heartwarming.
We really don't hear about it at all, like if Americans knew about stuff like that this I feel like people would be more empathetic.
The sad thing is this has probably happened to so many innocent civilians but we are unaware of it.
I also agree it is very heartbreaking that we can just go into someone else's country and destroy lives like that.
Like I get that we are trying to help people by protecting them but we are also hurting them.
As a student who attends college in the United States, I have been aware of the war going on overseas, however, the vast majority of people never hear incidents like Bassims that occur everyday to innocent people.
ISIS is another contributing factor who broke and dismantled both the military and education systems along with many innocent individuals homes.
I also agree that what happened to Bossims family was unfair and I could not imagine the type of pain that he lives with every day.
In many ways though, the United States needs to be in Iraq though, and the reason is due to ISIS.
I agree that it is unfair that the U.S trying to put dominance over the people so that we can spread our influence is wrong.
However, it is not like ISIS only strikes in Iraq.
One example would be when an ISIS member went to London and drove a truck into hundreds of people.
Which is why the situation in Iraq is such a mess because the innocent civilians have to cooperate with both ISIS and the Americans in order to just survive.
What I loved the most about this video is his response to this question.
I admire this man for how brave he is, and for not hating on them after all he went through.
But I dont think that no one deserves to go through this, the fact that he wont be able to see his wife and daughter again breaks my heart.
I think we can stop those events from happening if accept each other as one community.
You raise a good point when you say there is a lot being covered up when it comes to war, and that we never hear about the mistakes America has made.
While we may never be able to really put ourselves in the shoes of others, it helps to have the kind of communication that we had with Basim: serious discussions on how transnational government intervention is really affecting the lives of innocent citizens who dont have a say in the matter.
Personally, if that was me I would be filled with a lot of anger hate.
Additionally, I would probably blame the situation on the United States since they were the ones who directly negatively affected his family and house.
My family is my everything so if anyone took them away from me I would be filled enormous amounts of hate.
Then he said something that I thought was awesome he stated that his religion teaches him to forgive and that is what he did.
I thought that it was also cool that he still has friends that are American and has lived in the United States for eight years.
However, I do not know if I could ever forgive as easily as he does but I still think that is awesome that he can.
We are all the same inside, why are we so focused on differentiating each other.
I would, and just about everyone else in the room seemed to feel a similar distaste when hearing what happened.
I feel that this is where our stigma towards places like Mosul come from here in the states.
The fact that people of a specific faith try to interpret the words of ancient text and generalize them to an entire population is, in my opinion, wrong.
So, as Sam states, it leads to many arguments within the same religion about what should and should not happen.
The bible is holy text that should not be used for selfish purposes, yet if that is how someone interprets the meaning of divorce in the bible who are we to tell them they are wrong.
It is not my place to do so.
To a lot of Americans, all Muslims seem to be part of this group and they think that Islam is an evil religion when thats simply not the case.
This sparked a lot of conversation but what we all could come to agree on is that the war probably seems much more real for the people in the Middle East.
Much like you I never really saw it that way, but after hearing how your friend described it I was very intrigued by this idea.
I truly believe the United States has come a long way with respect to sexism, but I agree we still have a ways to go.
Ahmad is the perfect example of a real person in Afghanistan simply living his life in a place that happens to have conflict.
I was also surprised and saddened to learn how many civilians were killed as a result of this fighting.
Its not that what Sam talks about isnt true, its just that proving what is said is true isnt the focus of the class, having empathy is.
The class isnt about just getting informed, its about living your life outside of class constantly as a learner of social issues, not a preacher of your own beliefs.
The reason that grades dont matter too much in Soc.
Is because what goes on outside of class is in many ways more important than the classwork, and how you carry yourself on a day to day basis is what being a good student is really about.
The movies don't show the parts of Afghanistan that you mentioned.
The giant malls with designer stores are something that I identify with American lifestyle.
The story Rafi showed how people who decided to stand up to the extremism in the Middle East were killed.
I believe the war on terrorism is hard when terrorists blend into communities that fear them enough to remain quiet.
To lose your family, is an unimaginably horrible thing to have happen, and although I would pray to be able to give forgiveness, like he does, I see it being incredibly difficult to do so.
With him saying this really puts things in perspective, because most people tend to generalize the actions of few, to the people as a whole.
Many people are guilty of doing this, especially Americans, we tend to view all Muslims and all Middle Easterners as bad, due to the actions of a few bad people, he has learned to not be angry at us, because he knows there is a separation between all Americans, and those responsible for his familys death.
USA has the longest standing democracy I know about, and that is a privilege.
The lecture that stood out to me this week was the one when we online video chatted with Basim Razzo.
While on online video chat with Basim, a few students were able to ask him questions.
The one question that was asked that I was also very curious about was how he is not filled with anger at the United States.
I think that Basims response to this question really showed what is it like to truly forgive someone.
He came to the conclusion that it was only going to hurt him if he continued to remain angry.
Coming from a High school with incredible diversity in the student population I was fortunate enough to see the world differently.
I had many friends who were Muslim, East Asian, African American, Indian, and so on.
I am truly grateful I am able to see the world through a different lens.
For Basim and the rest of the innocent people in Iraq during this time, you cannot help but feel sad for what they had to go through, especially being innocent.
Although the media in the United States does not or did not portray the lives of the Iraqi people they were good developing people like us.
That is something that Americans have typically never had to experience besides 9 11 where we lost millions but we havent had a true war with other countries on our soil.
I thought this to be a very good question.
America could not justify what they had done to him.
He was a completely innocent bystander yet h had his entire world flipped upside down.
If this was me, unfortunately, I honestly do not know if I could forgive America.
So, he felt numb, unable too comprehend what had just occurred.
He gave two reasons for conquering anger.
He had many friends from the United States who were great, nice people.
So, he had no reason to be angry at the people.
His other reason for conquering anger was his Islamic religion.
The religion of Islam says to forgive and so he did.
I like to think that Basim would come to terms with America regardless of having traveled here or not, because I know that through meeting Sam and others he has seen the ways of many regular American people, whose own views do not represent that of those who hurt him so.
Bassim also says that he uses religion the guide him through his life, as he is a proud Muslim.
There have been many classes where I have really thought about things that I have never previously considered, but usually those thoughts dissipate after a few hours.
I am fortunate enough to say that I have not experienced a life-changing event like Bassim has, but his demeanor and mindset is admirable and inspirational.
He said he sat down and had a meal with Americans who were very respectful, thus making him realize that Americans are not bad people.
As Americans, I feel that a majority of us view the people of Iran to be terrible people who have a great deal of disrespect for America.
Personally, talking with Bassim was the first time I got a first-hand experience with a person from Iran, and it has inspired me tremendously.
Whereas those people have nothing to lose and that is why they do not mind sharing.
Even though a majority of the white population today is not racist, there is still a small amount that is and racial prejudice is surprisingly still a part of our country.
People should not be at a disadvantage for getting a job just because of their skin color.
If people were to really try to connect with one another and truly understand what each person goes through, then the world would see a lot less conflict.
Throughout my life, I have never really been exposed to Indian people.
At Penn State though, I have had multiple interactions with Indian people and it has definitely been an influential part of my life.
I never had any negative thoughts or connotations associated with Indian people, but I didn't really have any great associations either.
Surprisingly, I have found that a lot of the Indian people I have met are huge basketball fans.
The point I guess I am trying to make is that without reaching and connecting with different people, it is going to be impossible to change your mind about people, whether it be an individual or a whole race of people.
The world needs more opportunities to have open discussions and meet people who you may not associate with in the first place.
Not everyone has to travel the world to help those in it, there are several ways to give a helping hand, and I believe that all people of the United States, myself included, must make more of an effort to make the world a better place, any way that we can.
As I grow up, I want to take what I have learned from Bassim and pass his story and inspiration on to others.
But his daughter Toka will never grow up.
She would be about my age if she had lived.
So why am I here and she isn't?
But it means that each day I get to spend on this earth is a gift.
I am not a religious person, but I believe that God has a plan for Basim.
A man who say that God has blessed him after everything that he has gone through is a holy man in my eyes.
Sometimes their curiosity is for them to get a clearer image towards a specific topic or to broaden their knowledge about Islam.
The Sunnah is usually used by Muslims as a pathway for a successful life filled with blessings and flourishment.
They used the so-called sharia that they misinterpreted from the Quran and the Sunnah as their excuse to kill in the name of God.
In fact, in sharia, it is completely forbidden to murder anyone whatsoever and if a person commits the sin of murder it is equal to the killing an entire humanity.
So whenever Taliban forced all women to wear the veil and cover their faces it was completely forbidden.
When we had the skype call with Bassim, he made it clear that he is not mad at any American and that he forgave even though the American government was the reason he lost various family members.
It could have easily been America, but I cannot possibly relate to anything like that happening because Ive never experienced this here.
I have about four people in my family who are active in the military.
Its so easy to be desensitized to something that does not directly affect you.
Thats why the takeaway lesson from this class was to put yourself in someone elses shoes, preferably someone who has experienced an awful tragedy like war.
As citizens of a country where its a luxury to not experience living in a warzone, its our obligation to empathize with those who live in fear every day.
Islam is truly a peaceful religion that has been given an awful image by the very few people that actually do commit acts of terror, disgracing the name of Islam.
Basim is an inspiration to me in the sense that he is able to move on from the disturbing events he has lived through.
He is completely calm throughout the pain he has endured.
I feel like we were impacted by this segment of class very similarly Maxwell, as many of your points correspond to the thoughts and feelings I have had and am currently having.
However, being able to talk with Bassim and understand how he perceives America has had such a large impact on many of us.
It is important to follow up and do some research so that we are not persuaded to believe one way versus the other.
I live in a place where we are all created equally but unfortunately, that is not the case for others who reside in different parts of the world.
I think that it is extremely hard to understand how another countrys society truly is without immersing ourselves within it.
Although we do not all have the opportunity to immerse ourselves within a society in Islam, I think that being given the opportunity to talk to people like Basim helps to bridge this gap of misunderstanding.
This lecture has probably been one of my favorite lectures that we have had so far as a class.
I also really liked when the girls who don't wear hijabs tried wearing one.
It also must be pretty nice to not have to worry about what your hair looks like.
As a guy, this is something that I am always worried about.
Stacys question was one that I wanted to ask and I figured that a lot of people did as well.
I personally tried to put myself in his shoes and I had a very hard time doing that.
When the camera, swung to the girl in the audience wiping tears off her face, I was the same way.
Of course he was angry in the beginning, just as I think that any other person would be.
Finally, when he mentioned about his religion to guide him to forgiveness, I was speechless.
To hear him say that he was not angry at any American was something that will stick with me for a long time.
He genuinely is one of the strongest men I have ever come in contact with and I feel so lucky to have been given the opportunity to hear his story and listen to him speak.
I think that it is important to think about what Sam really was saying in this lecture.
There are just too many buts or ifs in the world to regulate with Ten Commandments.
From what they have inferred, they must do everything their lord commands or they will spend an eternity in hell.
He says that a man can say to his wife I want to divorce you three times and it is done.
He came back home from the college he got accepted too, and now sits home working a job and hopefully going back to school in the Spring.
It also, sucks for most of my friends who are going through with their parents getting divorced and they have to go back and forth to their mother and fathers house every week.
I would like to be able to talk to someone from Afghanistan who is a cild of divorced parents to see what their day to day lives are like.
Basim has been through things that I cannot even imagine going through.
His reason behind it is even more powerful I think.
You mentioned that he realized that all the anger he had was destroying himself eternally.
We find ourselves caught up in these grudges that can have a huge impact on our lives.
Sometimes more than they are affecting the people who they are held upon.
It is so crazy to hear from someone experiencing everything that you see on the news.
It is almost hard to grasp because of how different my life in the states are.
There are tragedies that happen everywhere, but I live in a mostly safe area and dont think about the terrors that can happen or the terrors that people are living in as in depth.
Hearing a story like this really puts life into perspective and shows you that the world is a crazy place.
Although the US wasnt intentionally trying to be the bad guys they ended up taking on the role.
I think religion is somewhat individual.
I found it to be disturbing when Sam showed us all of the murders that were said to be bible driven.
It is one thing to not agree with someone, but you can agree to disagree and tolerate one another.
The world would be a much better place if everyone found a way to remain open minded to things that they might not believe right off the bat.
I think that it is unfortunate how much conflict is brought upon in this world due to the different ideals and beliefs that people hold.
That's a word that very few people truly live by.
Granted, this is due to our social intelligence.
However, from this class I am learning that this is a dangerous instinct that can encourage racism and islamophobia.
Sometimes we have to admit our wrongdoings and prejudice.
Hearing other peoples story about the adversities they have endured and being able to understand or even relate to their pain is no small thing.
It is the key to changing our way of thinking about every person we encounter.
What this class has taught me is that people are not so different.
Even though a person may live in another country or have a different religion, they are more similar to me than I realize.
But if all three qualities are in both parties, I believe peace can be reached.
I think the first feeling that would hit me is sadness followed by fury.
However, I do not believe constant anger would solve anything.
He had this eye opening moment, figuring out that the problem was the way the government runs.
This was the moment when he realized that there is no use in being angry because it does not make everything go back to normal.
Religion can definitely be there for a person to guide them through times of hardship.
For some people, when they think of Islam, they think of terrorism.
It stems back to the way people interpret a religion and in American media, the Islamic faith is rarely portrayed as peaceful.
It makes me wonder why we always generalize an entire group or idea because of a few incidents caused by radicals?
He did not want to give us advice but invite us to be more aware of the world.
World history was the only compulsory history course in high school and it was packed into a single year.
Honestly, this course was refreshing because even though it was only about European history, it was still a break from the same 250 years.
The EU is a governing body that impacts all the member nations like the UK.
America is far more self-sustaining and the international dynamic America has with the rest of the world is come to our shores.
For this, I do not hold Americans solely responsible for on an isolationist attitude.
First off, I think that is awesome.
Ive been to so many classes in my life where the teacher dryly reads from a textbook every single class and I can say that throughout majority of those classes I have learned nothing.
It comes to the point where each day the professor reads directly from the book and when test time comes around I just memorize the multiple choice answers to get a good grade.
In his class he constantly tries to teach his students about things that matter.
In Sams constant research and studies of race and humans he still understands that there is still so much for him to learn.
This is the way a lot of classes should be taught; teachers should learn themselves and try their hardest to explain things to their students through their experiences and knowledge.
Not some textbook that they copy and paste into a PowerPoint.
I chose this video because this particular day in class stuck with me more so than any other day.
On this day, our sociology class met Basim Razzo, a man who's home and brother's home were destroyed by Americans.
What struck me so much about this class was the fact that we actually had the chance to speak with Basim over skype.
I was shocked when he appeared on the screen and at first was confused why he would even want to talk to us Americans.
After all, the American government was responsible for the terrible things that had happened to him so the fact he was willing to talk with Americans amazed me.
Here was a man who had lost everything because of the American government yet he wanted to speak with us students.
With everything that had happened to him, Basim said himself he was no longer angry.
Basim said that staying angry about what happened was never going to solve any problems and that is why he chooses to continue moving forward.
I know that personally if something like that happened in my life I would have a very difficult time forgiving and would be angry for a very long time.
This class was one of my favorites because everything Sam brought up I found interesting.
Yes because of the subject matter itself but also introspectively as I started to think about why I never think about it or separate it out from the issues happening in the world.
Prior to this class, nobody seemed to focus on the fact that interpretation is a key factor in the way religion is made into law.
Taking it further and applying Sharia to the religion Im most familiar with, Christianity, made it clear that this is an interpretation thing, that of course religion has key lessons to be learned and is in itself a guide instructing its followers on how to live a prosperous and beneficial life, but not everyone will apply that guideline to the present in the same way.
These areas of overlap, or lack thereof, are where we see difference in Sharia, and where I saw the nuances of using religion as law, in a way I simply had not been thinking about prior.
I really like your comment because it is really interesting to compare your culture to Muslim culture.
For this reason I think that to say a burqa is sexist is akin to slut-shaming, because either way you are telling a woman that she cannot not make decisions about her own body.
I also found this lecture to be very interesting because we were able to actually listen to someones personal side of how the war in Iraq has affected their lives.
In the United States, we are taught throughout our early years in school about the history of many countries, yet their current state of living is somewhat hidden from us.
Hearing him speak about how the U.S. government has single handedly changed his life forever made me take a step back and really think about what the real consequences of war are to everyday people like Basim and his family.
He himself was seriously injured, and his life changed after that.
What really struck a chord with me is that Basims life was first introduced to us in pictures and slides on the overhead powerpoint.
It may have been an accident, but loss of innocent human lifeno matter where fromis not something that should be taken lightly.
I chose to use this video for my post because I remember this moment in class vividly.
I think its important to have something believe in because it helps people rationalize events that sometimes seem like they just shouldnt happen.
It allows people the ability to make decisions based off of something that is usually deemed by society a good way to act.
However, like Sam said, I find it difficult to understand why it impacts so many life decisions that werent even a thing when the bible was composed.
Divorce and all sorts of other things are impacted by interpretations of the bible when nowhere in the bible are they mentioned in there.
As large of a book the bible is, its crazy to me that it has such an impact on modern day issues and problems that arent even mentioned in it.
This helps the catholic church because it seems they are losing touch with our generation and if they can become more progressive in thinking they might be able to reconnect again.
At the end of the Skype session, I felt connected to a man that lives thousands of miles across the globe.
However, a single question was fixed into my mind throughout the entire Skype session: how is Basim not outraged with America?
When faced with a situation as severe as Basims, a vast majority of individuals would curse society and be unable to pick themselves up from the ashes following this colossal loss of life and destruction of property.
However, Basim found the power within himself to reference the teachings of his religion to aid him in his struggle.
Furthermore, he was able to maintain his friendship with Sam and now is eager to spread awareness and teach us about the issues that plague Iraq.
I am so grateful for the opportunity to become enlightened by his story.
In this video, you see one of my classmates crying while listening to Basim.
When he explained how he fought through the numbness and anger, I was overwhelmed with emotions.
Before my classmate asked this question, I thought about it.
How can I hear more personal stories from Afghanistan?
How do I, as one person, make a change?
When I was able to hear directly from someone there about his life, family, pain, etc.
I agree with everything you are saying.
I would never be able to forgive or get over my anger if a foreign government accidentally did to me what happened to Basim and his family.
I don't know what I would do with my life and I commend Basim for staying true to his religion and not remaining angry for the rest of his life.
The media has no interest in putting a bad picture of the United States in the minds of the American people so therefore when something like this happens they choose not to broadcast.
I always thought of myself as open minded but after meeting and listening to Sam I realized thatI'm not cultured at all.
When the girls would not shake hands with Sam I was really confused.
Every class I find myself learning something new that I do not think i would have had the opportunity to learn except for the fact I am in this class.
This comparison was something very new to me, and it served as a connection to their style of living.
So, when Sam continued the story and described what had happened to Basim not too long ago, it really made the events hit home for me.
The pictures of Mosul were devastating, and I thought pretty hard about how harsh it would be if that had happened to a city in the US.
Next, I thought that this was the coolest class of the semester because of the way that he set the lecture up, and brought in Basim over skype.
That was an element of the class that I was not expecting, and it was even more real that the victim of the incident was right there to speak on how he felt right after we had just talked about it.
I completely agree with everything you said in this response.
I was waiting for this video to come up again because it honestly keeps me grounded.
It really shook me up because like you said, his life was so normal, he in no way thought that his house would be bombed that night, and it showed how quickly something can be taken away from you.
I was so naive before this class and hearing his story really opened my eyes.
Because Sam is so right when he claims that we are misinformed and only looking at it from a perspective that is not hands on.
We learn our information from others who are also misinformed.
I can absolutely admit it to myself that I am in a form an islamophobic.
But in the moments included in this video, Sam really put it all in perspective for me.
And it was a personally amazing achievement for me to have a mental breakthrough that our worlds aren't different.
And that theme is to educate ourselves before casting judgement, and also to respect others just as we want to be respected.
So overall, this video embodies one of my favorite experiences I've had and I hope we continue to have conversations like these in class.
To me it seems people often have trouble separating the two, especially when they only know of a certain nation or the people from there.
If people could just have the courage to say that their way may not be the best way, I think the world would be more tolerant.
This course has restored my hope in humanity because I know people who do want to change their preconceived notions.
I have more courage to speak the truth into situations where I would have stayed silent before.
You're right when you talk about the United States being a very diverse country therefore Sharia Law or any law established from religion would not work.
I believe a big part why it would cause chaos is because religious law is interpreted in different ways for everyone.
For instance, although most Christians are seen praying, reading the Bible, or singing, there are different ways people express their religion.
They use scripture in the Bible to justify their actions and believe it is a reflection of Gods work.
Its kind of something that cant really be taught.
It has to be developed through education, understanding, life experiences, and a good heart.
I didnt care to research or reach out to someone to learn what living there is like.
I believed the media and what you understand as an American point of view.
This is what people need to do, and its unfortunate that it has to be so difficult.
I agree with what youre pointing out here, we must see things from other peoples points of views.
If not, nothing will ever change.
I think President Bush was a selfish president who did nothing but bankrupt our country and start an unnecessary war in search of money and oil.
The bombing of the twin towers helped get the people of America behind the war at first, but not long after did we realize how horrible of a decision going to war was.
Another example of America interfering when it is none of our business.
He did attempt to withdraw troops, but the war and fights over power continued throughout his presidency.
I think Trump and Bush are a lot alike, and when all's said and done will go down as two of our worst presidents in history.
So to wrap up my comments, I agree 100% with Basim in his statement that our presidents are all the same, they all suck.
In addition, he talks about he is going to talk about many different types of groups like Asian, Hispanics and others.
If religions and people commit the same crimes or acts why are we allowed to talk about others differently and shame them?
But also, what it is like for people who are not white to live in American and just learn their perspectives and how they feel about the American culture.
I cant imagine forgiving America if something like this happened to me.
Then again, maybe thats because Im also not particularly religious.
Maybe theres a correlation behind that, but I cant judge this trend off of just Basim and me.
Ive never considered myself a particularly forgiving person but I know forgiveness is a major tenet of many major religions.
If someone did something to my sister or family, maybe I wouldnt be able to be so moral and forgiving.
This unfair judgement the muslims receive from the christians is just part of a lack of knowledge and understanding.
I always think that Sam is helping restore the faith in humanity, little by little, with every single group of seven hundred and a half people that take this course each semester.
I had to comment on this post because I relate a lot with what you said.
Whenever I find myself mad at something it is really hard for me to just forget and forgive.
I think the reason that this question was asked last year also is because Im not the only one that thinks like that.
You said you dont know if youd ever be able to forgive but Id have to say that I would handle it slightly differently.
Of course, I would be very angry at first, I dont know anyone that wouldnt but I can see how Basslim has come to forgive Americans like he had.
I feel like Id eventually come to the same conclusion because just by doing that he was able to spread his story in a much more meaningful way.
I would like to share my thoughts on Sam's last class regarding Muslim women wearing hijabs.
Initially, I thought they wore the Hijabs because it was written in the Quran.
Mulsim women were told to wear hijabs only when going outside or in the presence of male strangers.
They would be able to focus their attention towards their work and need not worry about the way they look.
I thought it was incredible how open and willing Basim was to tell his tragic story and relay his message of forgiveness to 700 American college students.
As the beginning of the class he stated that he teaches SOC119 every year and yet he will never have the same lecture twice.
This is the worlds mindset now a day and is why the hatred is so common.
Our government's actions and beliefs shouldn't be portray every single American person.
The fact that Bassim is able to see past the horrible actions of our government leaders is remarkable, especially in this day and age where the media only portrays us in a negative manner.
Personally, I think it is unnecessary for American troops to be occupying any sort of space in the Middle East.
But instead of turning the anger into hate for Americans, Bassim turned it into positive energy.
Especially when he wouldn't even get an apology from their murderers.
There should be a government organization that help out people like Bassim and make sure they get everything they need to get passed it.
Basim is a great example of someone we need to look up to in this world.
What he went through, and his ability to forgive are second to none, and I have so much respect for him for that.
All religions across the world preach forgiveness over hatred, and yet still I can see myself being furious for a very long time if I was in Basim's shoes.
Here, I feel like our culture is an eye for an eye, which never ends well either.
I give Bassim so much credit for maintaining his cool and not hating the government who did this cruel thing.
Bassim also said that Europeans were more aware than Americans to what is happening around the world.
We focus more on what is happening in our country which is selfish than to notice and realize that we should be doing more to help out other countries who are struggling way more than us.
Before listening to Basim speak, I never thought about how the United States military and government affects other countries, and I had a different view on forgiveness.
First of all, I never put much thought into what our government is doing to other countries.
Everyone makes mistakes, but it is different when someones life is at risk.
The compensation offered by the United States made me embarrassed because it was as if they werent sorry at all.
When he was asked how he doesnt hate America, his answer was extremely eye opening because I never thought about forgiveness the way he does.
I feel like everyone, including myself, should also let go of anger.
I decided right then and there that from now on I am going to try harder to let anger go, especially because there are much bigger problems going on in the world.
Coming from a family with many members being in the military, I have never really been in a conversation regarding what happens overseas.
These early drives are what motivated the United States to invade Iraq sixteen years ago.
When put into simple terms like that, it almost makes war seem pointless.
We practically invade this country at our leisure so that we can gain what we want from the situation, all while simultaneously ripping apart a country that is already struggling and bringing in more violence and terrorism.
Now it is a brutal fight that results in more citizen casualties than it does in soldiers deaths.
We never hear about what happens to families much like Basims, so this lecture really struck me and opened my eyes up to realizing that there are real people, almost identical to the people here in the towns of America, living amongst this anger and destruction that results from the war we started in Iraq.
I really love your response and also just how open you are with your feeling pertaining to society and the inequalities many face.
We have now touched on the topic of what privileges come along with being white, but we definitely do need to talk about the privileges that come along with being a man.
I think a lot of it has to do with society and how it is setup to put women in a certain position less beneficial than men.
But overall, spot on and I love your outlook.
It's stories like this that really put war into perspective.
For him to forgive what America did to him is huge, but it was really for him to move on with his life and reclaim his happiness.
I think a lot of christians have something like this on their mind, but are too afraid to say it because they fear they are saying something almost sacrilegious.
Like you said, saying that all homosexuals are going to hell for loving someone of the same sex is not hell worthy in my book.
Another good point you make is about how similar the two books are yet there is still hate and conflict between the two Very odd to me.
I also agree with you when you said that religious radicals should not implement or force a belief on to other people because it can lead to unpleasant events.
There are religious groups who use violence in order to send their message out that everyone should be following a certain religion.
We believe in karma, but some Buddhists think that the right karma involves killings for justice, which only contradicts the Buddhas teachings.
Now, there are people in Thailand who are afraid of practicing Buddhism because they are worried about radical Muslims targeting them.
He compares this to how we often do the opposite when it comes to Christians because we are a more Christian dominated country.
And until we can step into someone elses shoes, we wont be able to fix this issue.
I remembered Sam making the whole room laugh when he talked about the sins listed in the verse that made you an unrighteous Christian.
The things that would make us unrighteous in our religions eyes are things that everyone does, and we laughed because it is ridiculous to think that we will be denied heaven, or that we are bad people, because of these minor faults.
According to the Corinthians verse we saw in class, homosexuality isnt even the worst thing you can do.
I do not understand how so many Christians, and many other religions, can hide behind a verse that says homosexuality is unrighteous when they have themselves have more than likely done something else listed in that same verse.
Sam also brought up the point that the Quran had a part that was very similar to the Corinthians verse he read.
When you read only what you want to read, or hear only what you want to hear, suddenly your opinion becomes a religious fact.
It takes a lot of courage to do what he has done.
He was able to forgive the United States after they ruined a substantial part of his life.
As Sam said in class if we consider ISIS muslims then we have to think about whether groups like the KKK are Christian.
Throughout this class Sam is emphasizing the idea that people should learn about other cultures and this could open their eyes, so that they're not so judgmental towards people who are different from them.
Overall I think Basim was able to forgive the United States because he is aware that the actions of the government in this case do not depict what all Americans are like.
What sets Basim aside from most people is his ability to truly forgive, and I think that quality is extremely underappreciated and, honestly, uncommon in our society.
I agree with you that this lecture by Sam stood out, because I never hear of the Establishment Cause either.
I too thought that the religion stayed out of places dealing with the government.
The points you make about this video are very good ones and I agree with what you are saying.
Also like you stated that people can like a candidate due to their religion, but its not like they would be able to bring any of the aspects of that religion into their position in the government, so why does it even really matter?
I thought this was a very good point.
As a white person, it was very interesting to see the perspective as if we were the slaves.
I can now say I am really starting to understand, even though this happened years ago.
I would still be very much upset about this because they were my race.
But there is one issue I wish we talk about more in class.
They couldnt find jobs anywhere, no banks would give them loans so they couldnt start their own businesses, most of the plantations were destroyed from the war.
So they ended up going back to former slave owners doing the same thing.
But what people tend to forget about is how the native Americans were treated.
Yet we completely stripped them of their cultures and forced them to take up western culture.
We destroyed their way of life by killing all of their animals they would hunt and forced them to move into these horrible reservations that sounded great on paper but were completely dumps.
That they are just this unimportant piece of dirt that just got in the way of greedy wealthy Americans?
He took a completely different path and forgave the government that did this to his family and made a positive life out of it, which I give an enormous amount of credit to him.
The previous lectures have all given me that sense of lack of judgement, but one lecture I found to stand out the most was the video chat with Basim Razzo.
As Sam began to introduce Basim, and share his story of how they met and essentially grew to be apart of each others lives, my heart immediately sank when it announced that Basims family was innocently killed by American bombing.
Watching this video made me fairly upset because Bassims immediate response to the question was no.
To say something like this about the future of your country, really shows how hopeless he is.
Bassim said that this was because of all that has changed within his country.
Im trying to think of ways in which America can help change the hardship that Iraq is going through but there isnt much more we can do.
I was also wondering how much the Iraqi citizens even want America to help them.
A way in which the Iraqi people can help their country is by coming together and working together to find a solution for a brighter and less violent future without ISIS.
If not, Iraq could very well stay in this state of conflict for a very long time.
I do this via Twitter in most cases, since it typically has the fastest publishing of information about any current event at any given time, and I also read newspapers or online articles.
But I appreciate so much that Sam allows us to dive deeper and become more educated on the motivations of people involved in the events.
Listening to Richard Spencer speak in the podcast for our first quiz was really eye opening to a viewpoint that I sometimes can't understand on my own.
I was in absolute awe that after all that he had been through, he looked like a normal man.
Sam also made a good point that it is easy to view the middle east as a war ridden wasteland that is populated by evil people which is why America has to send troops there.
The way he has found forgiveness for what America has done to him is something I am positive not many people can do.
Hearing religion being used for law is all you ever hear about the Sharia.
They are really using this book as an because to do the horrible things they do.
What was also really interesting was to see that Christians group in places like Africa do the same exact thing.
They claim somewhere in the bible it gives them motive to kill all the infidels for not believing in Christ, or because they aren't the same religion they are is nauseating.
If I could talk to one of those radicals, I would ask them show me in the Sharia or Bible that it says its ok to kill people who aren't like you or don't believe in the same religion as you.
I do not know much about politics but I did watch some of the debates for most current presidential election.
I remember Trump saying how he was going to send troops back in to Middle Eastern countries because Obama had taken them out and thats why there is chaos (according to him).
This is crazy to me because I thought the United States could help and change anything going on anywhere because we are so powerful, but it now seems we are not.
Since Basim said there was nothing being done about the corruption that is getting worse in Iraq, I think the United States should focus on that.
He said all the money gets pocketed by those doing the corruption even though that money is supposed to help the people and benefit them.
Hearing from Basim and Rafi really opened my eyes and Im so happy I got the opportunity to hear both of them speak!
In fact, when I got to college, I found many Christians who alienate me in the same way because I'm Catholic.
I still love my religion, and will most likely be a Catholic until the day I die, but I can't say that I am still very accepting of other religions.
I also agree with Sams sentiment that people are quick to demonize people who are far away, unaware of their own hypocrisy.
They are Muslims Muslims they're just Moslems that interpret their faith in a more violent way than is normal.
I sometimes wonder what would happen If more people were able to empathize with others.
The bottom line is: People are all made differently, and many of those differences can be solidified through cultural upbringing and the experiences people go through.
What most people tend to not realize, is how trivial many of these differences are in the grand scheme of things.
How would you know how this girl felt when she put on the hijab?
Not everyone views the hijab with whatever connotation you do.
Either way you have no logic to be able to assume that these people have views that are completely diverse points.
Most of your whole response is based on your own assumptions that could be true or completely false.
Next time maybe you should think about what you're really saying and realize that not everyone has the same views as the American culture views you are thinking of.
Overall I respect that youhave strong opinions about this video, but I just don't think you're thinking about the big picture.
This class in particular made me very upset when we listened to Basim speak about Mosul's history with the American government.
Basim is one of many Afghans who are caught in a war that was not theirs and who lose so much because of it.
I cant imagine how much they suffer, and how to live a life after all these things happened.
I am just so amazed by the fact Basim chooses to forgive the American.
What we did in the class is not bashing America.
We just simply discuss the truth that happened.
I am an Eagle Scout and I have done a lot of exploring myself so hearing about his experiences in the desert was very interesting.
Many people experience issues when they don't have their cell phone which I find appalling.
If were going to send your children off to institutions that are supposed to better and foster growth there is no reason why events like this should not also be included.
Making sure that our youth have the best possibility to succeed is in the best interests of these people so it's actually very strange that more of these programs don't exist.
I think I would be depressed for the rest of my life.
I imagine Bassim has a much different narrative, not that hardship is widespread in Mosul, but that he faced many more challenges than I did.
I mean this when people are dismissing all the negativity around slavery and saying that it happened in the past and it isnt them in the present day.
During the talk it felt white against black and only looking that the color of your skin to determine the quality of injustice and crimes that had been done to the people.
In general whites are always on top but we have used slave labor in so many different means throughout history.
We need to remember that when we talk about race wars and issues.
The government has always been corrupt even when I thought I trusted them.
When Obama was president he did a lot of things that I personally don't agree with, like never going to Haiti during his presidency.
How am I supposed to know what is real news and what is news that is opinion based?
Finding facts that are true is a hard thing to these days.
The reality that some people live in this world is tragic.
I think the word itself is an eye opener because sometimes I can confuse the word meaning myself.
This is definitely a class on empathy however it just stinks that I feel like this class comes to be based off the fears and misconceptions sitting within the individuals in the audience.
I think it also shows courage about you that you can admit to yourself that there are things that you need to do and work on to be able to have empathy for others.
I also like the word choice of detach because I couldnt quite pick the feeling I felt throughout every class.
I think that is one of the best gifts that this class could give us as students.
I also like how Sam gets his mind set on something and just runs with it.
I think this is also effective because it makes for the most interesting class.
He replies saying that the first few months after the tragedy occurred he was numb, but shortly after he became angry for while.
That is what forgiveness means to me.It does not mean condemning the offense.
The video I decided write my response to is, How Are You Not Angry With America.
The title of this video was one of the questions a student asked Basim Razzo.
From what I remember, Razzo is from Iraq and he responded to one of the talks Sam gave and they a dialogue and that is how they became close.
But, his response made a lot of sense but his level of forgiveness is unreal, even though he has an open court cause with them.
After this lecture, I sat down and started thinking, even started talking about this situation with my friend because it really spoke to me.
And this made me think of how I sometime hold grudges and have no reason too.
He mentioned how soc119 is an ever-evolving class in which he doesn't use preset lectures or have the same discussions every semester.
I love how we don't follow a concrete curriculum because we are learning about the world currently.
Coming to soc119 class you will see and hear people from all around the world.
I believe being a globally aware person benefits you in various ways.
I also felt this way while listening to the Christian lectures.
They interpret their religion in a different, negative way and it burdens the reputation of their religion.
When I think of the Muslim religion I instantly think of middle eastern terrorists, when in reality most Muslims are normal, kind people.
I loved what Sam said at the end of this video that if you want people to see you in a certain way you have to see them in the same way.
Firstly I think it was a great idea to make people who don't know the reason behind why some Muslimladies wear a hijab.
I am not a Muslimbut was born and brought upin Qatar, a country in the middle east which is a Muslim majority country.
Secondly, it was interestingto see what kind of questions Americans wanted to ask the girls who wore hijabs.
It was a great class where we got to know a little more about the lives of such women.
Another thing that I noticed and found fascinating is the difference in the cultures.
I agree that the laws and rules of religion are a little blurry and do not spell out clear answers to all the challenges we face as a society.
However, Rafi has opened my eyes to life of an average resident of Afghanistan and since that class I have been trying to think of the Middle East in a different light.
Furthermore, this reminds me of the video that we had to watch for the quiz.
I found this interesting because it reminded me that people like Basim, from Mosul, could be so similar to someone in my family.
I was amazed by how forgiving he had become, and have thought about that a lot even after class ended.
This was an amazing lesson in forgiveness that I will never forget.
I found it so cute that a found a girl from his childhood on Facebook and was messaging her.
This class has helped me to realize that every person is different and can not simply be placed into a box that makes them all the same.
Going into class I remember Sam telling us about Bassos life and that he would be joining us over FaceTime; I expected to see a broken man.
Instead, I met a man who had forgiven those who had seemingly ruined his life.
The thing is, he did not see it that wayat first he did, over time Bazzo came to realize that the anger he was harboring was doing more harm than good for his process of getting over the death of his family at the hands of the American military.
I could tell as I watched him speak that he was at peace with his life and ready to move on.
When I saw the power Muslim religion gave Basso; however, I thought twice about the power of religion in ones life and how it will apply to someones morality.
Since that day, I have come to the conclusion that forgiveness can be learned through many mediums, one being religion, but the ability to forgive comes from within.
I agree that it is an accurate metaphor, so few people actually experience life outside of the cave.
While it should be a thrilling and wildly new experience, many people are afraid to step out and learn how other people live.
As a country that is so diverse, you would expect there to be much more understanding between various religions and cultures.
Perhaps it is the sad reality that human nature prefers to accept the incorrect perceptions of other because it is easier than seeking to understand on ones own.
I really agree with this statement because Ive seen how different rituals, traditions, religions, etc.
Theyre not all derived from the same faith, but sometimes different things work for me.
Sam is completely right when he says you really just have to go out, travel, and see the world in order to get it.
Living in the Middle East, I really got to see the conflict that exists in day-to-day life.
Its so easy to just turn against another side, but empathy is super important.
This is a really great point Sam makes in the lecture.
If we werent so caught up with political correctness, but instead talking behind each others backs behind closed doors, we would be a lot better off.
Bassim was wronged by the US government without a doubt, and the lack of compensation gave to him after his family was killed when the US bombed his home was absurd.
The Razzo familys horrible incident is the type of stuff we wont see on the news in our home country.
And by a country and a culture he had grown to love.
It takes such a peaceful person like Bassim to be able to access and learn that hatred and revenge do more damage than they do good.
He was able to make a personal connection to American people that allowed him to overcome the stereotype our government can create for us sometimes that we like to go where we are not welcomed and shake things up.
It was interesting to hear that the laws on divorce are not so different from American laws on divorce, some even less harsh, like when the husband goes missing.
People believe that Islamic women have little freedom, when, in fact, this is not true.
I agree with what youre saying about people being able to interpret the bible and other religious scriptures in any way that they want.
I was born catholic and confirmed into the catholic church but I do not consider myself a very religious person, nor do I discriminate against any other religions or interpretations of the bible.
I found it very interesting when Sam talked about how the various radical Islamic groups follow the same scriptures as the peaceful Islamic majority.
I agree with what you are saying about how changing this class has really changed my view on radical groups.
I also share the same views on the topic of the media depicting groups of people in whichever way they want.
The media has so much power in our society today, and they have the power to brainwash people with their headlines.
It is how we as humans understand what others are experiencing as if we were feeling it ourselves.
When dealing with people and particular situations I often find myself putting myself in other people's shoes, asking myself questions like Well what if I do this, how would ___ feel?
I think that everyone needs to practice empathy, even if they are empathetic people.
There is a preconception in peoples mind that makes them discriminate.
This is the reason why there is so much hate globally.
When there is an incident of Islamic radicalization it is in the news headlines, however other cases are not given the same hype.
We hear about wars due to islam and muslim killing each other, but never about other cases.
All the groups are dealing with the same issues, it is just that people like to play the blame game and recognize the wrong doing of others but never themselves.
Only when we start to see all the people through the same eyes we would look at us, we can start empathizing.
It is a difficult thing to do as all our lives we have believed in a particular idea, introspection will challenge that.
I never really thought how that I did judge other religions, but never consider that I should see the world through someone elses eyes.
I think as society we have to see each other in the same way in order be accepting.
It is an evolving class, which to me is really interesting and awesome.
I learn new things every class that I never considered before.
We may be the same person, but because religion separates us it makes us loose the human connection.
In my post this week I mentioned a quote Sam saidif you want people to see you in a certain way you have to see them in the same way.
It is truly amazing that Basim is able to be so forgiving and live his life without anger.
I remember him saying what good would he do if he went about his life with anger.
His religion doesn't teach hate and violence, but other twisted people interpret it differently.
In my opinion, the bible was never meant to be a law book to last throughout the ages, but rather a history of God's interactions with man immortalized, and stories told to give us a basic idea of what God wants from us.
I find myself sometimes stereotyping people but this class has opened my eyes to all the different ways I should be interpreting the world.
My heart sank as well when Basim told his story about losing his whole family to an American bombing.
Like you said towards the end of your post, I really do believe that there isnt much difference between religions and the sooner people can come to terms with that, the better off we will all be.
I think the bible is a great reference point but we need to remember what the old and new testaments are: stories.
What that means is whoever wrote them also took the word of the Lord into their interpretation.
Yet most of what is considered sin and what is not is left up for interpretation for the authors themselves to figure out.
I truly do not understand how Bassim is not angry about the horrible tragedy he went through.
I was a little surprised though to see him lack much of facial expression.
I also felt uneasy at the fact the United States offered him a subordinate amount of money that was to the point where it insulted Bassim.
I was also shocked he wants to move back where his family was killed.
I agree that meeting Basim really helped to alleviate prejudice against Muslim people simply because of their religion.
I definitely agree that the generalization of groups is dangerous, as it makes it so much easier to hate against people when we think of them as them instead of individuals.
I like how you said it shows a different side of the middle east, and believe that really is true.
The fact that only 17 percent of Christians have a biblical worldview is eye opening because that just justifies that a majority of Christians are in a sense prioritizing certain parts of the Bible compared to others.
Especially how you pointed out that out of a seven hundred lecture class, no one was following the Bible that seriously.
What I took away from Bassos experience was that forgiveness was the hardest thing he has ever done but at the same time it was the most rewarding.
If Basso thought forgiveness was too hard he would still be living in anguish over the loss of his family.
This only causes more suffering and is a shining example for why forgiveness is so important.
We are all constantly aware of what war can do to people but we never really get an opportunity to hear it from them first hand.
The interview with Basim really made me appreciate what we have but also to treasure and focus on all the good in my life.
Americans suffer from tunnel vision when viewing people who are Muslims.
Many Americans choose not to view it this way but our government is not full of saints sometimes they do some pretty bad things.
Maybe some people in the middle east feel like were the main issue and the only way to solve it is to rebel and pull off attacks on America.
Something definitely needs to change.
One of the most intriguing parts to me was when he talked about the reason for his forgiveness being his religion.
They give the whole religion a stigma of sorts and Basim stated the exact opposite.
I thought that was beautiful.
You have a man who has every reason to hate and be spiteful but instead, he chooses to forgive people of the race who did this to him.
I think more people should feel this way when it comes to Muslims as well.
Instead of categorizing everyone who is a Muslim as a disturber of the peace and a creator of violence, we should see the peace that some of those people practice.
I think more people should take Basim's approach when it comes to things like this.
It was so much fun and I feel like I really discovered myself then.
The experiencebecomes so much better without technology where you get to know the true worth of relationships and has a great impact on your personal health.
Basso was such an inspiring teacher for the short time he talked in our class.
I think I will forever use his knowledge of forgiveness throughout my life.
It was truly heartbreaking hearing Basims story but at the same time, it was important that United States citizens hear about this sort of tragedy so that we can do our part to help in the future.
What I found very inspirational about Basims conversation is that he said that he was not angry with the United States citizens and the U.S. as a whole.
When Stacey asked how he can stay so even tempered and positive after he lost those closest to him, Basim responded that he does not get angry because the anger would be the end of him.
While living in the U.S. he met some very good friends and got to know people in this country on an individual level.
Also, he brings in the fact that his religion that is Muslim shapes him as a person and he follows the teaching of forgiveness in order to helps calm him and not put the hatred on to Americans.
And of course, my country Vietnam had also been at war with the United States.
Take Agent Orange for example, not only the generation at war but also generations later still suffer from its horrible toxic effects that caused deaths and severe mutations.
I know when my grandmother passed away, at first I was confused, wondering why this was happening to me yet not quite feeling the pain of the loss.
My feelings were very similar to feelings that Basim expressed though our situations were extremely different.
I also really like how Basim explained how he came to forgive and move past his anger.
When we do that, we overlook all of the good, innocent people that inhabit that place and have nothing against us.
I think Basim teaches us a valuable lesson of forgiveness and having a good, accepting heart.
I personally would do the same, but feel I would never quite get over it and be as positive as he is.
Of course he does still blame certain people, but overall has the most positive attitude I have ever seen.
He lives such a different life that I never think about how other people in other countries are suffering.
It was eye opening for me in that moment to think that I am so blind to what is actually happening in the world.
In this class we talked to Basim, a man who even with all the sadness that has hit his life, has still found a way to believe in peace and fight against hate.
It was a disrespectful action that Basim rejected and is now trying to sue the government for the wrong doing.
He showed us where he lived which looked very advanced which shocked me as not much of American media covers the nice parts of Iraq but only the war ridden sections.
It introduced me to a new view of Iraq and its people which goes to show just how unconsciously biased Americans can be.
Basim was a true gentleman and was kind and it gave me a whole new perspective of everything and got me thinking about other places that the media impoverishes in its segments and coverage.
Every president and their associated Congress have become increasingly partisan.
Both sides believe that they know best about every issue and so they refuse to compromise with the other group.
Any major decision takes significantly longer than it should.
It involves a mix of domestic, international, and financial issues that provide the basis for countless discussions on the value and necessity of war.
We were seeing, first hand, someone who lost everything.
He had a better attitude towards life than many of the privileged people I encounter in America each day.
I was so shocked how he mentioned that he was not mad at America, simply because many people do not even know.
Bassim mentioned that there are other people in the world who want to live happy, healthy lives.
I feel so lucky to have been given an opportunity to be apart of that Skype chat.
Something that doesn't get talked about nearly as often as it should.
I also like that Sam plays devil's advocate a lot of times.
Also, in a college this big, we can only imagine people coming from so many different countries with different backgrounds.
It is so important to respect and understand people's own perspective.
U.S. is a melting pot with so many cultures.
When I was in Indiana, listening to the ideas from people from one the most conservative states in this country, I constantly disagree with them.
But then, I think about how they grew up with these ideas and how the areas they live in are very rural.
I am glad Sam is teaching this in class, cause when we can all try to understand each other, this world would be a much better place.
I really like that while the overarching messages of the class are kept the same, different topics are discussed year to year.
Religion has its place when it helps others to establish an identity and work towards being the best person that he she can be but it was understand when the Constitution was created that people are free to practice or not practice a religion and this needs to be respected by all.
Bassim makes it clear that he runs his life in accordance with his faith, which is to love others and not be consumed by hate or spite.
Where I find hope most from his story is that he has grown, in some way, to accepting that his life can never go back to being normal.
I wish him the best in the future, and I hope that anyone who is afflicted by something so horrible can rebound in any way like he has.
He may not have had hope about the future of Mosul or even his country, but there were still aspects of his life he enjoyed and was happy to talk about (like his son getting married).
He had nothing to do with the war, yet his home was targeted and his dear ones lost their lives.
He is so forgiving, provided the violent bad image of muslims that is prevalent, has no basis.
I see it as scripture that gives the people of the religious group something to believe in and it changed the way I see muslim people.
To obey a book that was written hundreds of years ago today just does not make sense.
Religion is a touchy subject that should not be in politics.
I find this to be amazing because it can't be taught via a standard textbook- lecture course.
It's sometimes hard to fight against our own subconscious biases and misconceptions so it's necessary to flip the script and put yourself at the other end of the discussion.
Once you understand that although people may appear different, theyre people just how we are then the window for judgment gets smaller.
He had every reason to hate, but still forgave unconditionally.
Why are we taught to hate Muslims and their motives when they are just like us?
This happens to innocent people everyday and we are kept in the dark because our government does not want us to respect and to have empathy for Muslims.
Our government is distracting us from the real issues they are causing, and are only pointing fingers at Afghans.
This class is a great eye opener for those who have thoughts about muslims and other religions as well.
He challenges views of people who are even sure of their own.
However, it is distressing to see people make blind ideas still.
People were killed that day, yet it was overlooked by Trump.
Sure, he's right both sides were violent, but both sides did not stand behind a violent message.
You can criticize governments and their regimes but you cannot generalize the actions of a government and apply such to their citizens.
All of the innocent people that have lost their homes, loved ones, and belongings cannot be looked at in the same way that we looked and thought of Saddam Hussein.
This is something that I think any student who has gone through the American education system needs to listen to because I really do think its important.
I agree with Basim that there is a lack of geography teaching and history teaching in our schools, because we seem to only focus on U.S. matters and U.S. history.
I remember when I was in high school and middle school, my social studies history classes would have students do current event assignments each week.
People ignore the ideas that condemn their own actions and instead try to deflect the attention onto a small group such as homosexuals.
While the bible does say being a homosexual is a sin, it also states that fornicators, sodomizers and much more are also sinners.
Christian sharia has taken all the attention off of people who have committed equal sins in the Bible and forced it on a group that is more easily oppressed in homosexuals.
The church needs to be held accountable for their lack of following the Bible by what it actually says.
People may change their actions or they may stop saying they truly live by the Bible when they know what the real text says.
He said at first, he was so upset by what had happened that he was numb for a while, and also angry for a short amount of time.
But he continued, I felt that anger would just eat me from the inside, and he added how it was hurting him to be angry, more than it was helping him.
I think its awesome that he judged Americans by the nice people that he met when he was here.
When there are children involved, the time separated increases.
I find this interesting because in this video, getting a divorce according to the Quran is far simpler and much faster.
Divorces in the US are different but also very similar to the ones in Afghanistan; one major thing is the money aspect.
The father has to pay the wife the money for all of the needs of the wife and the kids, but only until the kids reach the age of either sixteen or eighteen.
It is agreed upon that the father has to pay all of the money that he had promised his wife at the time of their wedding.
It kind of depends on how badly she wants the divorce I guess.
I myself am an advocate of that, my parents have been divorced for many years and I live primarily with my mother but see my dad often, but I have never had to live with him full time.
Another thing that I found interesting was that the man can say he wants a divorce but that doesnt mean that it is going to happen, there is a process just like there is over here.
They say that he just has to say he wants a divorce and it can happen but that is actually false according to our speaker.
His family was killed in a bombing by the United States military, so one student asked him how was he not more mad at the us for what had happened to him.
He said that he was not mad anymore because it was only going to eat away at him.
He was numb and angry for a few months but he realized that feeling that way provided no benefits to him.
I thought that it was a great move by Sam to bring in Bassim because it showed us that people on the other side of the world go through a lot of difficult times that we pay no mind to.
It put a lot of things in perspective for me because it really showed me that an exam that I have next week is not really all that important.
I thought that his mindset is an exceptional way to overcome hardships and more people should approach difficult times in their life with this mentality.
I know that it is much easier said than done, but Bassim is right.
I am no exception to sulking after something bad happening to me, and I could not imagine losing my family like he did.
What is the point of holding the Bible in such high light if those who call themselves Christian do not even use the book in the means that it is meant for?
The Bible is so well known and 'followed', it is put in hotel rooms for free.
This is confusing to me as someone who is not religious in the slightest.
But Christians choose not follow their book, yet callmany muslims terrorists for following theirs?
What if they, too, don't let the book influence all of their decisions?
Pretending to understand the divine and utilizing this understanding to create laws, which everyone must follow, is authoritarian at best, and undermines what it means to live freely.
I believe we should have freedoms in our life, to practice our own religions, and exist in a society where laws are not based on any one persons religion.
Stacy, a student, asks Basim why he isn't angrier at the United States for the bombing of his home and family and how they tried to resolve it.
Basim chose to forgive, as that is what his religion tells him to do.
Yet, the problem is that this happens all the time, and we don't even realize it.
I think this conversation sparked many emotional reactions as this was the closest anyone has ever experienced the travesties of war, especially on their own side.
However, I would never forget, and that is why Basim still hangs on to a hatred of the American government.
I found it interesting when he stated that the main reason we went into Iran was to gain political control for access to the oil in Iran.
If I were in his position, family murdered, house gone, belongings lost, with little to no recognition by the public, I would not be able to keep as composed as Basim.
It is extremely important to throw away the labels and judgement we have on people.
We all have our own original ideas about things; it is hard to listen to someone who disagree with you because mentally we reject their ideas.
However, we should step into their shoes and listen to their opinions to understand them.
There is always something valuable of peoples talk when we listen in their own perspective.
I would be miserable if I didnt forgive people.
Spending all of your time hating people and never moving forward is not a positive way to live life.
Thats the power of religion though, God helps us forgive others when they have no reason to be forgiven.
I think that in most cases it is ones ignorance that makes them not want to see both sides of the story.
People feel strongly connected to beliefs that they have had since a young age.
So it is not hard to believe that people simply choose not to accept others beliefs because they think theirs is right.
When looking at a situation through a different persons view, we can see aspects of everyday life that we have not considered before.
For example, the day in class in which women wearing hijab discussed what life is like, I never considered the fact that they enjoyed not caring about doing their hair or worrying about someone thought of the way they looked.
Many opportunities like this one would not be possible unless the person is willing to consider others beliefs and what everyday life is like for them.
Without the ability to accept difference, people will never understand each other fully.
Also, I agree with the points you bring up in your response.
And another point you brought up is the interpretation aspect of the Bible.
David, I felt the same way while we were in class during the live streams with Bassim.
As an American, I can not fathom what it would be like to have a group of people come to my home and tell me how to live my life.
It is easy to forget that it is happening all over the world because it normally does not make the headlines for the news.
He brings a lot of issues to light that many of us forget about on a daily basis.
With that said, I think it was a general consensus in the class that the way Bassim and his people are being treated is a tragedy.
Having Basim talk to our class showed that every little decision that is made internationally can have a huge effect on a person that lives in that country, and we would not even know.
The devastating reality of having this happen to anyone is appalling; Bassim lost family members, his house, and items that are irreplaceable because MY government dropped a bomb on them.
I also think what about everyone else this has happened to, how do they cope with the situation, are others able to put the violence that has been done to them in the past and forgive like Bassim?
I was heart broken when I heard Basim talk about his house being bombed.
When a student went up and asked why he wasn't angry he said it was because that is what his religion taught him.
I'm not religious but even if i was I don't think I could get over something like that.
I also wish the media in the United States showed us more what Iraq was like because then we could understand what is happening when there is a bombing there.
I though Iraq was very different from what it actually is like.
I feel very strongly about the topic you discussed and I agree completely with your post.
As a Christian, I know this would be difficult to enforce in the United States.
Everyone interprets things differently, so there is no way we could live our lives following these books step by step.
What is the most interesting to me is that his religion is why he forgave.
He survived, and believes that there is a reason god let him survive.
because I just think Basim's answer is beautiful and should be a message to everyone.
He also mentioned that American people had always showed him kindness, the problem lied with the government.
I think there are 2 takeaway lessons in Basim's response.
I think many Americans can take this lesson when thinking about muslims or anyone with a middle eastern background.
the second lesson is that Basim is actually living correctly in accordance to his religion.
It's not just Basim's religion that says that, but many is not all religions do.
Looking back, I think this is because it is something that is happening so far away from me and thus Im not able to sympathize.
I really don't everyone who was bombed will have the same feelings and reactions as Basim did.
I know that I would not be able to react the same way that he did.
To think that we are merely atoms ruled by an unknown force can be an extremely saddening thought for some people.
The simple act of thinking of them makes some people feel so lost and depressed that life does not seem worth living.
Individuals who would feel completely hopeless without it.As you said, no one truly knows what is really happening and who is in charge, but religion provides a sometimes easy and peaceful answer to some.
It was just crazy to me to even think that our country mistakenly dropped a bomb in his area, which took the lives of his loved ones.
What I believe is even crazier is that no one even stopped to talk about the people that this bomb killed.
Bassim lost some of the most important people in his life and it was not put in the newspaper or talked about in the news.
The bomb that caused him so much pain was basically irrelevant to the rest of the world.
When the student in Soc 119 asked if Bassim was mad at the United States for dropping the bomb, I immediately thought that he would be somewhat resentful because as much as I hate to say it our country is constantly hurting his.
However, to my surprise and I am sure to everyone else's surprise Bassim showed empathy.
Empathy is something that brings us all together and allows for a connection that can help us grow as a people.
It is hard to have empathy for someone that you have distanced yourself from socially and culturally.
I think that soc 119 is a great step in uncovering empathy.
How could he stay so calm while telling this story?
How was he able to talk about it as if it was just a normal day?
I could not even imagine losing my family due to an accident and go on living my life, still being the same happy person that I am.
But Basim was laughing with us, telling his story as if it was not as bad as it sounds.
The fact that Basim was able to forgive the Americans for such a devastating event in his life is truly amazing.
I don't think that I would have been able to do the same and I feel I speak on behalf of everyone when I say that.
I have gone to Catholic school my entire life and believe fully in God's power.
It is such a hard thing to be able to forgive those who have done you wrong.
It is an even harder thing to forgive when you don't know who the person people were.
Personally, I cant decide if it is morally right for someone to pick and choose like that.
On one side, I do understand the fact that people want to believe in a higher power, and follow the bible by which that power preaches.
Do we really have such different beliefs?
I also found the way Bassim was not angry very surprising too.
I know if I was put in Bassims shoes and my family was blown up by foreign bombs I would never be able to live it down.
I think everyone can learn a lot from his attitude and the way he deals such awful situations.
I think people can take a lot away from this because it shows that sometimes you need keep going with life and work to change what happened instead of dwelling on the horrible acts.
Bassim truly opened my eyes to the truth about what is happening in other countries due to war.
I was so shocked that someone could be so forgiving and want to teach us rather than letting his anger control him.
I liked how you mentioned that many of us swear by our religion but probably could not live by it in this situation.
The fact that he can use this as a way to put his life into faith amazes me.
His outlook on life is incredible and I feel so lucky to have gotten a chance to be educated by such an inspiring person.
I learned I few things that I didn't know before, and that is that women who want to be separated from their husbands have to have one of four reasons to explain their decision.
The husband is still required to give to his wife the money that was promised at their wedding.
Honestly, I thought that Muslim culture regarding marriage was entirely different from that in America, but I was surprised to find out that that is not exactly the case.
The ability for the class to actually interact with someone who has experienced the brutal side of war I thought was an interactive lesson with empathy.
Basim said he had no other choice but to turn to his Muslim faith in order to feel somewhat better.
He trusted that his religion would guide him through his life and would give him the strength to move on and cope.
I believe Basim is truly an amazing person and his courage and strength is inspiring.
Basim said that ever since ISIS came around everything has changed and countless innocent people have been hurt.
The bombings are what really surprises me.
I really give it to Basim to be able to talk about this and not feel so much hatred for the United States for the unforgivable mistakes they made.
I also do not know if I would be able to put it all behind me as well as Basim has.
Basim said that people are spread out and in areas that are different for them so I am interested to see how things are going to play out.
It wasn't until I had a long talk with my mom that she told me whenever she was stuck, she would just pray.
I don't really remember why or how I stopped going to Church, but in the back of my mind, I knew it was wrong.
After that, I began to pray more and more whenever I was in a tough situation.
That comes with open mindedness and not making yourself closed off from any sort of rhetoric or new ideas.
That's why Sam says Cs get degrees and that we will all die so nothing matters.
I don't think he's stating obvious facts, its just the perspective he has on life and what actually living means.
I couldn't even begin to imagine if I knew that my family was buried somewhere under all of that.
During the whole Skype interview, the question that kept on popping into my head was also, how is he not mad?
I agree with you that if I were in his shoes, I would have so much animosity towards the people who were responsible for killing so many members of my family.
However, I don't believe that people should follow it word for word.
Like you said, times have definitely changed and the world has evolved, so it does not make sense to follow everything the Bible states as it is written.
The amount of innocent people that are being killed is very alarming.
Too lose almost your entire family in the blink of an eye is a very chilling thought.
I have nothing but respect for Basim to be able to keep living.
This is what war is now, nothing but drone strikes.
We are so used to using our drone strikes to handle the work for us.
But we dont see that aftermath.
All we see is our target being destroyed through a screen who knows how many miles away.
Not only that but sometimes the intel for these drone strikes are bad and innocent people die.
Basims had his children taken away from him and it was done so suddenly.
Yes I attended Catholic school when i was young and practice my faith regularly but I also do strongly believe in the separation of church and state.
I think it is great to have faith in some support of religion because it can give people a sense of purpose in their lives.
Having the faith that there is someone there throughout their daily lives, listening and watching over them, can be very beneficial for those who need the idea of hope to carry on when times are bad.
That being said, I do not believe the Bible or the Quran should dictate how a person should go about their life.
just because you think what they do is wrong.
I would have never thought of it but it plays in very well here.
I feel like if people could just experience life of other people for a day, they would realize that we are all the same.
I feel that when individuals do this people take things out of context, or become too extreme with promoting their ideals.
As you stated in your response I also believe that people need to focus on the positive messages in each text such as how things like how to be a good person, and forgiveness.
I think that individuals who do believe in God should use their messages as a guide and not treat what is written down in the bible or Quran as law.
It is imperative that people keep their free will when following and organized religion.
Sam prefaces day seven of class by diving into what exactly this class is.
Thus Sam has to tailor his lectures to whatever the issues are present at that time are.
He attempts to show that these radicals in religion are not just apparent in the middle east but in the US as well.
Overall, this is what I believe Sam tries to achieve with every lecture, whether it be about Islam, African-Americans, Asia, whatever the topic, he attempts to provide perspective.
Kristen, I also wrote about the topics you wrote about and I could not agree with you more.
It definitely was an eye opening class and I too had not put much thought into how our government impacts other countries civilians.
They should be willing to offer Basim anything that he wants after what they did to him and his family.
Like you said, I was expecting him to be furious with our country because I know for sure that is how I would be feeling.
Everything that Basim said was really interesting and I plan on keeping up with what happens in Mosul.
We can often get into our own heads that we are comfortable with our lives but I believe we should always push our boundaries and comfort zones.
I find it unsettling that the first thing people think about is anger when it comes to a situation like this.
Of course, some events have valid reasons to be upset at, but at the same time, Bassims point that the anger only hurts you, and does not benefit you in any way, is the key in life.
It was very eye opening to see something so horrible happen yet how he has made it through and has been able to not have a hatred towards Americans.
For him to be so resilient and get through such a hard time really shows a lot about him and that no matter how far apart we are we all go through inner conflicts, obviously some much worse than others, but none the less we all go through inner conflicts and face choices.
I loved the sodomy example Sam pulled out in class.
I would say the majority of the class identifies themselves with a certain religious group and seeing the hands go up really makes you scratch your head.
It's pretty scary as well when you take into account the level of ignorance in this country and how the media has weaponized it against people subtly.
This class was great at eliminating our western belief that women who wear a hijab are not being oppressed and that wearing a hijab actually empowers these woman and allows them to be much more comfortable and free in their own skin.
One of the problems in my opinion with the lesson is that Sam skipped over part of the western oppression argument.
Think about how often our laws here in America are amended, if we still followed every law exactly how it was originally written in 1787 our society would be VERY different.
Many things written in the Bible can be viewed differently by different people, we cant go up and ask Jesus, hey what did you mean by xyz, so we interpret how we want to, which might be different than how our Christian neighbor interprets in.
If I was in that situation, I'm not sure that I would be able to completely forgive America because in my eyes we are not worthy of forgiveness.
America ruined everything that he had and hardly gave him anything in exchange.
I'm not implying that money could have equivocated the lives that were lost but the least America could have done is give him enough money to cover the costs of the funerals and buy him a new house that was equal in value to the one that was destroyed.
I am really glad that Basim has allowed Sam to open up to us about his story because I think that it is really eye opening to see how quick someone else's life can be ruined in a matter of seconds.
How is that we can so easily murder thousands of innocent lives with the flick of one finger.
However, at the same time there are so many evil human beings out there that we cannot just let them roam free.
I honestly feel that using these unmanned bombs is the safest answer for the United States and they are more so thinking about the innocent lives that make up their troops, than the men, women, and children who live in Afghanistan.
I am trying to ask myself this and the only way I can justify it is if I imagine my father, brother, or sister in the army.
It is unfair for Afghan people and I wish there was a different solution because after hearing Basim's story, I wish there was something I could do for them.
We dont realize how lucky we are to live in a country that is not torn apart by war like those in the middle east.
We really are grateful for not having constant danger every time we walk out the door.
It really put it in to prospective when you compare ISIS to the KKK.
But as soon a most people see a Muslim they jump to conclusions and Islamic radicles.
I also agree that same does make it seem like the world could be a better place with his positive out look on things.
Sam later talks about how businesses in some states have the right to discriminate against people if it goes against their beliefs, as well as having pastors and other religious figures to deny marrying someone based off their personal beliefs.
Jesus did not go to the people who were well liked and accepted in society, he went to the outcast and the downtrodden and gave them hope.
I also really appreciate what you said about you personally feeling guilt, as we all should feel some form of guilt, after all, it was our country.
Growing up in a post-911 society, Bassims story made me start to think a lot about the military and the conflict in Iraq.
They were just normal people living their everyday life and then an accident with the military changed that.
This is something that American media usually does not talk about.
It is really interesting to hear his thoughts, and it is inspiring how he carries on in his life without hate for the United States.
If a foreign nation destroyed everything that I care about, I dont know how I would react.
After World War II, veterans returned home to the United States and an economy that was now booming.
He allows the current events that are relative in our own lives come to fruition and become the topic of our class for that day.
Having an instructor who is willing to be this free and natural in his teaching techniques has many advantages.
What he teaches is fueled by passion and curiosity, not because he has to.
Nor does he grow tired of lessons because there is always something new and different.
Sam explains that we have been focusing on Islam so much because he feels that it is a relevant topic in our lives today.
However, a member of the KKK carries out his heinous acts in the name of his Christian god but we do not make that connection.
His spirit is inspiring, and I think that a lot of people can take a lot away from what he said, and they should.
Ever since I had started taking photographs, I have personally experienced a growth in feeling empathy for others.
When I look through my pictures and see the people I have shot, I sit and think about the things they could be going through.
If many others began to just take a step back and try to understand someone elses story, I believe things would be different.
Trying to understand another person takes time.
For some strange reason, people no longer want to take time out of their day to learn about something that benefits them.
We also need to stop living selfishly.
If we can step back and come together, there would not be so many stereotypes and generalizations.
However, I believe this is the kind of thing that may never happen because many will always judge and not take time out of their life.
It is not our cultural norm to give every single guest a gift.
Sam and the lieutenant have both spent a ton of time in Afghanistan, and have nothing but positive things to say about it.
The activity that stood out to me throughout these two weeks was the the last one of the week we did where they pulled down four girls who didnt wear hijabs and four who did and they got to ask each other questions.
I loved this activity because in a normal, everyday setting just walking down the street I would never strike up a conversation with a random person and ask them why they wore what they wore and what it meant to them.
The comment this particular girl made was so cool because it made me realize that not as many people as I thought are THAT offended by what other people wear and sometimes they even think the clothes you have on are cute.
I think after listening and watching this activity Ive learned that its good to ask questions and have conversations with people you usually wouldnt.
I'm sure it's something we were all wondering while listening to him speak.
I do think that Basim Razzo's time spent in America is a large factor that allows him to have that quality.
It's great that Basim is able to understand that the main problem is not with our people, but instead with our government.
Lastly, I think the way Basim perceives his religion is what helped him to completely get through this tragedy.
Even though I may not directly follow a specific religion, I still believe that having a belief system in anything can guide someone through a tragedy.
I know that I would not be able to handle something so heartbreaking like losing my family.
The way he explained it made me reflect that it is true, being angry was not going to make the situation any better.
He talks about how he lived in America for eight years and while he was living here he met friends that were helpful and good to him.
I like how he thinks of the good things that he lived in America instead of hating on it and his friends who had nothing to do with the situation.
I think that is very good of him because he is not creating hate.
He also talks about forgiveness, which I think is very important because if you do not learn how to forgive you will not be able to move on.
His family members were killed by the United States, yet he was still extremely genuine and forgiving when he spoke to us.
I had a different perception about Iraq until I heard from Bassim, which was really interesting.
We have families and needs that we hope to fulfill.
If we form relationships with people in different parts of the world vs. just believing what we see on the media then we can have a more accurate understanding of the world around us.
I have distant family in Ireland who I do not communicate with too often.
After this lecture, I messaged my Aunt on Facebook to see how she was doing and find out more about her life in Ireland.
Through this simple gesture, I am able to get a better grasp on life in a different country.
I like how Mohamed touches on the idea that a majority of Americans do not have a clear understanding of what is happening in foreign countries.
Lastly, Mohamed is right when he says we should all feel a little more empathy for others because in the end we are all humans and we will all die someday.
On the subject of marriage, I also found it very interesting how different reality and our perception are.
We were influenced by so many wrong facts that they blind us in many ways.
Many of us have become desensitized to the violence and death that happens across the world.
We begin to ignore the news and not view they deaths as people, but statistics.
Not only, did we begin to see these conflicts from a new perspective; we also learned how far forgiveness can get a person.
This, in itself, is a very powerful image that Sam portrays.
I think Sam did this to really drive home that the War in Iraq was and still is very real and although it wasnt fought on US soil, lives were affected in such a deep way.
I agree that this 7 minute lecture really summarized what Sam teaches in this class, we all want to understand other cultures other than our own and this lecture showed us how to begin doing that.
I love the point you make that Sam is helping restore faith in humanity.
I'm somebody who has always struggled to forgive.
However, this is something I've been working on.
It made me realize we can not let our bad experiences, even one's that may alter our lives forever, create hate and prejudice.
Admittedly, there are times where I let a misandrist mindset take control of my thoughts.
I have to recognize that this is happening, and realize it's not right and change the way I think.
You also don't have to verbally forgive the people who have treated you poorly.
America has destroyed their life and it is impossible for me to understand that those people who are suffering are not going to hate American.
I believe I am not the only one who thinks in this way.
The war that caused by American make the people from the whole world think that Iran people are all terrorist.
He said he was warmed by American back at the time he lived in USA.
He also explained that his belief and religion told him to forgive.
Looking back through the past two weeks there is so much knowledge we have gained on other cultures.
I love these movies and have a hard time wrapping my head around the daily lives of so many affected by violence.
What is common between the movies and what Sargent was sharing was culture and people's lives.
I really enjoyed hearing him say about training the soldiers for the culture.
That is so important and beneficial, I would like to further find information out about what they learn, and how the soldiers have to form a sense of trust.
Another good point is conflict is inevitable obviously in a position like his but having the knowledge is extremely important, especially when it doesn't end in the death of the human.
I think culture is important and vital especially when it is respectful.
Learning more information about culture is so powerful.
From there, all I can really think about is that same question.
There is no sense in hating someone or something in order to make yourself feel at ease.
You can surely hate something that they have done, but extending your anger in other directions is pointless.
Numbness that will carry on with you forever because you cant seem to let it go.
I believe that religion should not get in the way because each person has different beliefs.
If religion gets in the way it causes many disagreements.
I also think it is pretty cool that your high school had a supreme court case.
I definitely think that it was wrong making someone recite the bible verse at the beginning of class especially if you do not belong to the same religion.
This makes the person feel excluded since they do not have the same religions beliefs.
Kofi, I can agree with your statements that we can not move forward as human beings if we struggle to learn from past history.
This may also lead to people becoming more excepting of others as they no longer see immigrants as a problem but see them as victims.
I decided to do my discussion post on the video A Class on Empathy because I felt that it was important to note why Sam talks about the things he does.
He brought up that talking about Islam is important because we see a lot of Islamophobia in our country today which I absolutely agree with.
Both sides have those types of people, but a good majority of Americans unfortunately fail to see it in their own people.
It really makes you think before you generalize groups of people especially after something big happens in the news or anything like that.
When Sam started explaining Basims story it broke my heart.
It made it even more powerful when I found out Basim was going to speak to our class.
I was still shocked even when I saw him on the screen.
At first I did not even understand why he would want to interact with Americans, I know if I was in his shoes I would have so much anger and most defiantly hold a grudge.
The American troops entrance into Iraq following the events of 9 11 were justifiable to say the least but the bombings of the homes of people of Basim were not.
Reading the post that Basim sent to Sam was genuinely sad.
The tragedy that Basim survived, doesnt downplay or undermine what happened here on 9 11 but it most certainly made me realize that the utter destruction of individuals lives didnt stop here.
I appreciate his honesty towards the questions that were asked and admire his strength experiencing such an imaginable tragedy that he did.
However, I felt that it was worth it for me to respond.
I did not actively choose to stop going, per say, but I just did not feel a need to anymore.
I felt that it was almost in-genuine and hypocritical for me to go to church when it is just something that does not speak to me on a personal level.
I believe that no one should judge others or be judged, no matter what kind of person they are.
He jokes with Sam because apparently last time Basim spoke to a Soc 119 class someone asked the same exact question.
He speaks of his great relationships with Americans and then says something truly unbelievable.
This story is really inspiring because with all the issues facing our country today forgiveness is not really talked about enough.
I think if more people were willing to listen to his story of forgiveness , perhaps people would take what they learned and put it into their daily lives as well.
When your only exposure to a country is videos of Humvee's and tanks patrolling the streets your bound to view them in a certain light.
Either way it is concerning to think that your views may be being controlled by someone else.
All in all, I really enjoys when Sam's discussions are designed to make you think a little bit and ask questions.
My perception of the area was definitely colored by the negative images that are propagated by the major media outlets in the United States.
But regardless, he answered that his Islamic faith taught him to forgive, and that guided his life-path past the anger he felt after his wife, daughter, and other family members were killed in an American bombing.
I thought this was a beautiful lesson, and one that members of Christian backgrounds would do to recognize as similar to the beliefs on forgiveness within Christian faith denominations.
Divides are very readily drawn between Christianity and Islam, but in this belief I see an irrefutable sameness.
I was surprised at Basims next statement - that he did not hate Americans themselves, but rather the American government.
If I were in Basims shoes, I think that I would have a very hard time distinguishing between the two.
But, we do not know about the Quran so a lot of people assume that the Muslim faith allows for these acts of violence even though it doesnt.
We are really quick to say that someone who commits a crime claiming to be Christian is not a Christian.
But, some of these same people are quick to call middle eastern terrorists Muslims.
The issue is that people do not do any research on the religions that they are prejudiced against.
I completely agree with Bassim when he explains that the media in the United States has a lot of control on how others, including ourselves, view war and people from different parts of the world.
I know that I sometimes forget that the people and places I read about in news articles and see on TV are real and just like me.
Bassim also stressed that Americans need to not just learn about and memorize geography, but also get to know it on a more personal level.
The action taken by Bassim is something beautiful.
I agree with you that religion is a powerful thing because many live their lives for a religion.
Bassim has shown an amazing action of forgiveness because he is a man of his religion.
You can buy another house but a home is built around family and if you lose your family nothing will ever feel like home anymore.
We need to take away all the important lessons from this interview.
Not being blind to the media andrealizingthat victories in the U.S. might be some of the worst times in other peoples lives in other cultures.
Also being able to forgive even at the worst possible situation because its only going to impact our own lives living with resentment andnegativity.
Personally, I do not really follow politics or watch the news often.
However, I knew we were in war with Iraq.
I realized that they had a life, one that most of us live every day in safety.
I was truly heartbroken when I saw before and after pictures.
Especially when I saw pictures of his wife and daughter that died during a bombing in Mosul.
It was just a bomb as if it is socially accepted that this happens on a daily basis.
Humans share the same core values and it is wrong to stereotype a whole religion based on people that claim to be religious.
But to kill one sniper, seven houses were destroyed (euronews 1).
First, it was really interesting to how Basim was angry at first, but then realized that the anger was hurting him more than it was helping him overall.
Debates dont really shift my opinion regularly.
However, Sam kept bringing up one strong statistic after another to really grab my attention.
Furthermore, the commercials and edited pictures were not only entertaining, but they carried a message behind them.
I realized that the issue of racism seems like it is better than it was 30 years ago, but in reality, the statistics are the same.
It really is true when people say that the news portrays only what they want to portray, even if it means sabotaging the truth or making people look bad.
This whole time I have believed that Afghanistan is a place of war and horror as well due to the fact that we dont get insight on what actually of is.
We arent the only people in the world that have to deal with war and terror in our country.
I loved learning about the Muslim religion and the reason for his peace is because of that.
It was beautiful what he said.
Sam never sticks to a set path of what exactly needs to be covered, going with the flow of things.
His excitement for the material makes it easy for me to engage in otherwise something unassuming to me.
Never before have I thought about the class in this way, but after watching this clip it was a very fitting title.
Furthermore, when Sam connects this example to the class theme of empathy, I could not agree more, as when we put ourselves in anothers shoes we are able to see the world in a more complex way, leading to intellectual growth and development.
Hearing from an actual person living in the midst of war really put things into perspective for me.
To think my country actually invaded this country and participated in the destruction of this mans city is also insane.
It shocks me knowing that I thought America is only out to save people, but in reality, were ruining peoples lives in the process.
I couldnt imagine putting myself in this mans shoes and going through what hes gone through.
After he showed us the picture of Mosul after the destruction, I was completely astonished as to how a city can be in ruins so badly.
It went from a beautiful place that I would even consider living in if I had the choice, and war was not going on there.
It makes me wonder if Mosul will ever get back to the way it used to be.
The only real concern I have is why he wants to move back to Mosul.
I also remember in class him talking about how the United states offered him a small amount of money for accidentally bombing his house, killing his family, injuring him, and destroying everything he owns.
There are some things in the Bible that are written very plainly with very little room for interpretation.
As much as faith is a very individualistic idea, there also needs to be a general consensus for teaching purposes.
Each denomination has a different idea of how it should be taught.
However these disputes should solely be to seek clarification into the other persons ideas and to possibly get to know them better.
I can't say I know and understand what he's been through, but if it was me, it would of been hard to find forgiveness and not blame America.
Although, in one part of the video he did mention that he lived in America for a few years, and he had friends and he thought they were all good people; hearing him say that made me realize that I sometimes I do blame others for one's decision.
With every situation I've had with someone and I complained about with her, she always tells me to find a way in my heart to forgive.
That living with hate won't get me anywhere in life and won't undo what's already done.
She always said to forgive but never forget.
I felt this was one of the most interesting, insightful lectures of the year so far because getting the chance to hear directly from a person who has experienced everything that Basim Razzo has had to endure.
Hopefully, throughout the year, we will get the chance to meet more people of different cultures with different backgrounds who can give us insight into their daily lives just as Basim was kind enough to do.
People are so busy fighting about their differences that they end up neglecting all of the things that make them similar.
And even further than that they usually have more in common than not in common, but they do not see it because they are so focused on the things that they differ in.
But then to see the very person whom these things happened to sitting there was emotionally jarring.
It was a very unique opportunity to get to talk to Basim and actually ask him things that we were curious about.
We react with violence in order to drive them out, and because of that we associate the regimes themselves with violence.
It was the US military that put his life in danger above all else.
Empathy is so powerful when we really come to terms with it.
Its amazing what emotion can do when you put yourself in someone elses shoes.
After the conversation with Basim, I find myself disgusted by the America that we live in.
Is anything we learned about the U.S. true, or just some twisted story to make us seem like the Good Guys?
What could I possibly do to help these people find retribution?
I think it was amazing that he took the time to speak with us because it made the situation that much more real.
Since the war is such an ongoing phenomenon, I think they tend to put its importance on the back burner.
You have to try to forget yourself and imagine their situation and how life must appear to them.
Just because a small radicalized group believes thats what Islam is telling them, doesnt mean that the rest of Muslims agree.
Its very easy to generalize about a certain group of people if you arent part of that particular group.
With President Trump proposing more aggressive military action and behavior in the Middle East I fear that the United States may be soon causing more harm to these people and their families instead of protecting them and allowing them to rebuild their homes.
I realize this is a very difficult and complex subject but I hope that we can find a way to combat terrorism going forward without putting families and ordinary people in the crossfire.
First, is that this is not the first time a lot of us have heard about incidental deaths from bombings in the war and we don't really talk about it.
So having Basim talk about it allowed us to empathize which grants a much deeper understanding.
If we do not, we may continue to ruin the lives of innocent others like Basim and his wife.
I agree with Sam when he says we need a new perspective because now the christian community has an opportunity to look upon itself as Muslims would look over on us and now we can start to think about the world in a more complex way.
This video allows us to step in somebody else shoes, not just Muslim or Christian, but anybody and see what the world looks like in their eyes.
To make his point, Sam said something that really struck me and made me think and reflect.
We live in what he calls a Christian Land.
However, that is when we let our guard down the most.
I thought about a crime show I used to watch.
A Muslim man noticed this and tried to help her, but she completely ignored him and ran the opposite direction, right into the white males trap.
I can assume that this Is because we have this fear instilled in us when it comes to people of different race, religion and color.
However, there are white Christians who can me monsters.
But Bassim was not angry with America nor resenting what happened, and his comfort in what has altered his life forever is his faith.
Bassims faith is rooted in God, and so he puts his hope in him.
It is not alarming to me that someone who has a faith background handles a devastating situation like his in the way he did, but I think it brings up important questions about what role religion plays in someones life, no matter what religion they identify themselves with.
To those who do not believe, what do you run to when things go south?
I think a lot of times when bad things happen in our world, people often go and point their fingers at God, wondering WHY he would ever harm his people world.
But I think the way Bassim looks at it, he knows God is in control.
It was so heartbreaking to hear him open up about how he coped with his loss.
From what Ive seen in my own life, I think most people feel this way when they lose someone that they love a great amount, or when anything as traumatic as this happens.
I also understood how he felt anger, because I know that is another normal response to a situation of that degree.
I thought it was truly amazing that he was able to take that anger and do away with it, because he knew that if he kept all of it and continued to be angry he would never be able to move on from the situation and accept it.
If you really take the time to think about it, that is truly terrifying.
I also like how Basim rather than bash America, does the complete opposite and starts complementing us and even saying he loves America.
You also made a good point when you wrote about forgiveness.
If people could learn to forgive I really think the world would be a much safer place.
History will continue to repeat itself until people learn to coexist and are more willing to forgive those who have wronged them .
It was inspiring and I believe everyone was able to take something away from that class.
I definitely agree with you that there is a huge generational gap in terms of acceptance of differences.
Prior to modern technological advances, entrenched communities of certain racial ethnic groups may have never encountered someone who wasnt like them.
However, I cannot believe how strong his character is in that he has to ability to look forward and not spend his whole life condemning those who killed his family.
Instead, it is very interesting that Basim was so calm and even laughing when our class skyped him.
Not being able to go back to your home is a terrible feeling and I really hope he gets to return home soon.
One thing that stuck with me from Basim speaking to us was how he just told us to try to make peace with whomever we can.
Right now, we live in a world where hate is always around us too and as human beings, we need to be able to focus more on peace than hate.
In Basims case, he stopped hating those who killed his family because he knew that hateful actions would not help with anything.
We see this all the time, even as recently with the hurricanes that have come through the south recently.
Its very easy for us to sympathize with people in Houston or Miami that speak the same language as us that we see in the news every day and may even be our friends or family members.
By being able to engage with many different people and cultures and having an open mind we can learn to have empathy for all people, regardless of where they are from.
I found the topic of divorce very interesting as well because divorces are becoming increasingly popular in America.
In most religions including Christianity and I believe Judaism and Islam divorces are strongly discouraged and only allowed if there are instances of adultery or violence.
I like the fact that in Afghanistan even after a couple is divorced, the male is still held accountable for his family and is still required to provide for them unless the woman states otherwise.
Also, child support in America is weakly enforced which allows the men to get away with not paying.
However, he soon realized that his hatred and bitterness would only tear him apart and that he owed it to his family to keep living.
it is Basim's faith as a Muslim that guides him through his life as a noble and morally good person.
I personally admire Basim's courage and openness with the events that have made his life so difficult.
I understand why he is angry and could never imagine going through what he has overcome.
It was clear to me within the first minute of him speaking that he is an above average intelligent person.
Perhaps it is appropriate to say that it is the responsibility of the United States to do more for Basim after they essentially destroyed his life and his family.
All we are shown are war zones, mass destruction, lifeless bodies in blown up streets, and ash and blood covered citizens.
A lot of the time the news shows only the bad parts of the Middle East, making everyday Americans ignorant to what life is really like.
I know many people that don't even know the middle east even has shopping malls, colleges, parks, and nice manicured lawns.
But of course the news would never show an American Military screw up because they are too busy portraying us as heroes.
Those who are to blame are those who lead us.
If only they knew that we were in no danger to begin with and the battle is fought just because of our economic interest, I am sure many would not be in the army today.
Its a horrible byproduct of war that feeds and often times creates prejudice and demonizes the other side, even though the majority of those people are normal civilians, just like us.
I have nothing but the upmost respect for Basim after getting the chance to speak to him.
Understandably, when you live with war for nearly a decade it is easy to feel like all hope is lost.
So, back to my original question, how can we fix this broken system?
Would civilians be safe, or safer from a situation that Basin experienced?
I also agree that Bassim is an incredibly strong man.
To experience what he has experienced and not have hate for America is truly inspiring.
I think if everyone took more time to see that a persons beliefs are not reflective of their government, there would be less conflict in the world.
We met Basim Razzo, and he is such a kind hearted, forgiving person who made all of us feel his pain and loss when he told his story of how his home was bombed and several of his loved ones were killed.
When we think about something remotely similar happening to us, we tend to get very angry; I was disgusted and felt for him immensely while listening to his heartbreaking story, but he had such a grace in explaining himself.
I loved his response and it made me think about how sometimes I overreact about small things that dont even affect me in a big way, but he is able to forgive and continue to love even after things that were so important to him we just ripped from his life.
I feel like we can take some knowledge from his religion and turn our hate into love and understand that being able to forgive those who mistreated you is better than hating them and having anger towards them.
After hearing him speak, I want to take the knowledge and outlook that he has and incorporate it into my life as well.
In other terms of integration, I feel there needs to be further acceptance of cultural differences socially by individuals.
I know that I would probably never have the courage to do something so incredible and I really admire that about Bassim, as well.
I also really liked how you brought up an example of how some Americans tend to not have as much compassion for others as Bassim does.
It seemed like it was justified that America should have gone into Afghanistan to find the terrorist group responsible for the attacks on 9 11.
It was really a pivotal moment in history where the culture of the United States changed and was focused on preventing any other attack on the homeland by preparing for war in other countries.
With what Sam said, the invasion of the United States to go into Iraq was really to acquire their oil above all else, rather than focusing on the interests of the Iraqi people.
With the story of Bassim Razzo, I think Sam wanted to remind us that the people's countries that we had invaded into are people just like us.
The fact the the errant bomb by the United States government which landed on Bassim's property did not even make the front page of the Times really shocked me.
The thing that most brought this point to bear was what happened to the man speaking in this video.
An Iraqi man who was educated and lived in the United States, house was bombed by collation forces during the war against ISIS.
The attack claimed many members of this mans family including his wife who was only several feet away from him when the bomb struck.
When he recently returned to Iraq to work, but still lives with the ghost of the incident.
He said that there was no difference between Bush, Obama, and Trump in how they were handling the problems that face everyday people in Iraq.
He specifically said that the biggest problem was the corruption of the politicians throughout the country.
To me this speaks volumes to an often-forgotten part of war, in any war, the rebuilding, and the effect it has on the people who live there.
I am not well informed at all on the Middle East- my own fault- and the most I ever hear about that area has to do with war.
What I hear is typically surrounded by some sort of negative stigma as well.
Sam introduces Ahmad Rafi along with Arghawan and Yasmin, which creates a very real feeling surrounding the topic.
As Rafi is introduced he begins to tell how he unfortunately was born into the conflict zone that is Afghanistan.
His normal life is certainly not anything compared to a normal life that we live here.
It is something I would not ever be able to imagine.
Rafi stresses to work for the peace- which is definitely something you hear of more often lately.
However, it is so much easier said than done and I believe in practicing what you preach.
Although I am not the most fully informed person when it comes to war, this lecture left me thinking and remembering.
I also agree with you about knowledge being learned in more ways than finding out from a textbook or striving for good grades.
Bassim truly has a heart, and should be a role model for all those who have experienced loss due to war.
The fact that he is able to turn his tragedy and grief into a lesson for others instead of hate is truly amazing.
It makes me so upset the way the media society in general twists our view of what a culture and country is truly like, to make our country seem so much better than someone's across the world.
This strips a country filled with beautiful people of their true identity and slaps on a label that makes them seem as a lesser than.
Could you imagine how amazing the world would be if we started treating others the same way we wish others treated us?
We dont always have the opportunity to see the war from people who are living in the actual warzone.
However, Basim was able to find peace after losing almost everything through Islam.
I find it interesting how religion can be used as a tool; it can be used as an instrument of violence such as how ISIS is using it to create a new caliphate, as well as an instrument of peace such as Basim using it to forgive those who harmed him.
I think Merve has a great point in that she rings up how Sam helps us view people as other human beings regardless of their culture, religion, or sexuality.
In reality, Basim is a part of a society where the American citizens do not spend as much time on as they should.
Specifically, I lived in Texas for several years as a kid and in that time I took TWO full years of Texas History.
We came to the conclusion that no, it wasn't, but it is responsible for teaching us about different perspectives and different people, which it generally just does not do.
I agree that our isolationist attitude really isn't the American people's fault.
However, it is our responsibility to demand change.
Being able to hear someone speak that experiences war every day.
This is something I am guilty of myself.
I am not aware of what people experience on a personal level.
Most of the time we almost do not realize the huge impact it has on people's lives.
I asked myself what we could do to stop this situation and also came to the conclusion that, we as students, cannot do much about it other than recognizing the problem and spreading awareness.
Because of his ability to understand this and make the adjustments from seeing through the hate, he now lives a life free of resent towards Americans in particular.
For example, the experience Bassim went through is extremely tragic and painful, yet he was able to look past the anger and realize that it was only hurting himself.
By understanding that anger solely restricts us, new doors, experiences, opportunities will all open up.
If Bassim never rid himself of the anger he would not have been able to look at myself or other Americans as good people and from there a whole country is excluded from his liking because of his internal anger.
Similar to yourself, through this course, I am slowly starting to realize just how inhumane white people were in the past, which is something that I really had trouble visualizing previously.
I also found your point that things were not all rainbows and butterflies to be not only very humorous, but a fitting description of how I was taught history in lower level education.
I know it may be heard for us white people to hear how racists we really were, but through the role reversal demonstration with African American people telling history as if they were the superior race, I think the harsh realities were effectively illustrated.
It is a mind-blowing idea because we can truly see then how the way we view other countries might be the same as how they view our country.
Sociology 119 is a class that every student in college should take because it opens their minds to allow people to change their perspective and accept others.
Sam speaks about how there is an Islamic-phobia now because the media conveys that Muslims have been killing because of their religion.
However, there is a big difference between Muslims and extremists who kill for Islam.
The Islamic religion actually preaches for love, tolerance, and freedom of religion and somehow Islamic extremists changed what the Quran had hoped to sermonize.
Nor have I heard that hating someone else in general is tolerable.
In our small group last week, I said this lesson hit home for me.
However, I have gone through a fair amount of emotional distress in the fallout of my parents' divorce.
But life has had a crazy way of teaching me the right lessons at exactly the right time, even if that notion seems so far from truth in the moment.
No matter how difficult the trials may be, if I keep moving forward there's always hope for tomorrow.
He's somehow been able to accept that and make the most of his life despite an unthinkable tragedy that clearly could have been prevented.
He has gone through such extreme tragedies that no person should be even relatively okay after.
And, Basim is doing okay and living his life to the fullest.
His religion tells him to forgive and he uses his religion to guide him through life, and thats what he did.
The video starts with Sam discussing how the class is always changing, which is very important because as the world changes, education must too.
It is very true that we do not talk about christian killings even though they are occurring throughout the world.
That if you want people to see you in one way, make sure to see them the same way as well.
This is a concept that seems very basic, yet is forgotten in todays world which is what contributes to islamaphobia.
In everyday life if we start looking for justice and fairness in how we discuss events, we will be able to see Muslims and Christians are not that different at all.
Obviously Basim cares so much about his family but when telling his story I think a lot of the audience was angry for him.
What really stuck with me was how he does not hold any resentment toward Americans because he knows that even though the tragedy he endured was caused by America, he knows that not all Americans are so careless.
He lived in the US for several years and got to know Americans as people not one huge stereotype or outlet for his anger which is a lesson I think we can all learn from.
If people would follow Basims example and move past anger in order to better themselves and others a lot of problems in this country and the world would be solved a lot faster than the current rate.
It was really crazy for me to think that the people in my life that I knew that were outwardly religious were the ones who were blatantly going against teachings in the bible itself.
I think that its used as a guideline, and personally, all of them were written so many years ago, they can even be outdated.
Bassims story was truly heartbreaking but also encouraging at the same time.
I definitely feel like that is something that everyone should learn to live by.
Personally, I always try to forgive people who had done something bad to me or not hold a grudge against them because it makes me feel as though I am giving that other person power by letting them affect my emotions.
This obviously isnt an easy thing to do, as situations may vary from person to person but it is not everyday that we hear about stories similar to Bassims in our everyday lives.
This made me wonder if we as Americans still have grief towards that tragic event, I couldnt even imagine how it would feel to have the same fear everyday.
Being a White Christian male, it made me realize that it is easy to condemn and bash other groups such as Muslims, but it is a lot harder to see the faults in the group I identify with most.
I appreciate that this class is conducted differently every semester.
Thus, immigrants like me tend to overlook the atrocities that my American government inflicts on my Muslim brothers and sisters around the world.
If those who are in line with the mentality and ideology of radical Americans carry out the governments agenda, then there will always be fear in minorities and immigrants.
Without dramatic measures, immigrants like my family who have worked hard and surpassed the average American family will always feel threatened by those under our financial status due to the lack of support from our government.
Even though mentioning the word status shows a lack of acceptance for humans being humans simply due to our DNA structure, I still believe that financial domination would prove a sense of superiority (similar to arrogance but not really) to those under us.
I also think this class has been very helpful in getting me to open my eyes to new perspectives that I had never thought about before.
Coming from a very white neighborhood myself, I can feel overwhelmed at times because I have never had people to challenge my viewpoints or opinions.
To be honest, people never really got into talking about controversial topics, so this class is like a huge wake up call to me.
I think it makes everything more personable and relatable in a way.
Sam started off class by addressing the day being 9 11 and how the world shifted.
I did not understand the meaning of this business, until it was brought up that the military ensuring the safety and well being of our country also means getting important resources in order for us to strengthen and keep us powerful.
The question Sam repeated was how would I feel if this happened to me, just to have my resources taken away, close lives gone, everything gone.
Though I was not actually in the same situation, these questions allowed to me gain the perspective.
In the following video when we actually spoke with Bassim, I was heartbroken.
Even after all this time, he was no longer angry of what we did.
That was something I could not relate to, I would only be furious.
SO many people go to church as a Catholic or Christian, but end up doing things that could prevent them from going to heaven.
I knew you weren't allowed to participate in same sex activities, but to think Saddamy was against the bible is strange.
Actually, I feel as though its happening right now with all of this White Supremacy stuff going around.
From this class and this particular question I thought was something that was very interesting.
Especially since we were taking into perspective someone else's views.
Although anger is an emotion that all us as humans experience.
When Basim said that he was angry for a few months at the U.S.
It makes sense to me for him to be angry at the U.S. for what they did and are doing.
However, Basim did not let this emotion swallow his morals and virtues.
Being angry at the entire group for an excessive amount of time is tiring and can really take a toll on someone.
Like Basim was saying, with him being so angry all the time, he was becoming restless, sick, started having pains in his body and wasn't feeling well.
Not everyone is a dangerous person or want to take advantage of other people.
Like Basim said in the video, when he came to america.
Basim learned that not everyone is a racist or even a person that wants nothing more than to cause pain.
In this clip a student asks if president changes have had any impact on Iraq.
While we can do as much as we can to help a problem we possibly have worsened, there is a limit to how much we can do.
He does say some things have gotten better, but he doesn't seem to have much hope for the future.
The fact that nothing has changed since 2003 is mind boggling.
Not only must we contribute knowledge but we should give private citizens money to rebuilt what has been destroyed by our errors.
When ISIS came in and began to change the lives of those living in Iraq, they changed it in such a way that forces us to ask ourselves if the country could ever recover.
War is one thing, and countries have been able to recover from devastating wars, but it is incredibly difficult to come back from an entire culture being wiped out and replaced by another.
No internet, no digital televisions, ISIS took it all away and assumed control of Iraq, returning to the point of how retaliating against a controlling force in the way that ISIS did was not how things should turn out.
As for if the country could return to how it once was, it is impossible to say at this point.
The United States government has been involved since 2003.
None of the three leaders we have had since the start have been able to put an end to the bloodshed, so before the people of Iraq could even hope to return to the lifestyle they led before, the war would have to come to a conclusion first.With tensions rising, when that end comes could certainly determine if the country can rebound from ISIS and the war.
I feel as though we only know what we hear on the media about these places so sometimes I view these places as the enemy even though it is just one little group who we are in war with.
I was surprised that he was not angry at the Americans for the bombing because thinking if it was to happen to me I think I would be.
He is very strong and logical that if he stayed angry, the anger would just eat the insides of him and that is no way to live life or even move on at all.
From this it is important to remember that there are innocent people that have been blamed for doing nothing and have been majorly affected by this conflict.
I enjoyed this class so much that I also talked about it here in the discussion.
Something needs to be done and the people's perspective has to change.
When I came to class that day, I was tired and unfocused but once I found out what the topic was and how this man was, I could not have been more aware and alert.
Forgiveness is the most powerful tool, and seeing Basim put that into action makes me want to live my life to be more like that as well because if someone can forgive something that awful, everyone should be able to forgive.
However, there was something special about the way that he introduced Basim that made every phone screen in the audience dark and not a cough to be heard.
As it turns out, there are almost no differences.
Basims life was turned upside down when his house was accidentally bombed by Americans.
I know, personally, my heart dropped.
I thought he was so similar to me, but how could he be?
I thought about how my life would have changed if I were Basim, and honestly had trouble just processing it.
When his face was in front of mine, my empathy was through the roof.
Every problem I was having suddenly felt so small.
I greatly admire him for having the courage to speak about the incident in front of so many people on a livestream.
My father passed when I was in 7th grade, and I still have trouble talking about it without getting teary eyed.
He said that it did nothing good to him to be angry about something that he cannot change.
Bassim explains that he came to America for 8 years and he saw nothing but kindness from the people here.
Living in America, I never have really thought about our government being a big problem for other people.
But hearing Bassim talk about what they did to his family made me look at our government in a different way than I have before.
I have so much respect for the way Bassim looks at his life.
Domestically, the US people get caught up in if we should be the world's police, and of course other foreign policy.
Naturally, as Americans, we believe we see vast differences between the foreign policies between George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump.
However, they all had have the same goal to bring stability in the Middle East.
In addition, it is also fair to say Obama exacerbated this corruption by pulling troops out of Iraq, ultimately leaving a vacuum of power that was filled by ISIS.
The general who spent tours in Afghanistan and spoke at one of our lectures discussed rules of engagement in war.
I have always thought about this and was never able to understand it but in this talk I fully understood the reason of the US government entering Iraq.
This is something to praise.
The United States hasnt been helping the middle east in some aspects and it shows in everything that Bassam has told us in class.
Although the United States has helped a tremendous amount in the middle east, many changes cannot be felt to the civilians like Bassam, and in some instances the United States has made things much much worse.
I never really thought about the people who were actually affected, or their families, or their feelings.
I also loved how he spoke about his religion and how it taught him to forgive.
I really respected him when he explained that he does not hate Americans, how he has American friends and how he is upset with the government, not civilians.
I feel so honored that I was able to hear his story and listen to his wisdom about forgiveness and love.
The sooner we open up the borders that we construct for ourselves around the rest of the world, the sooner we can start to experience everything the world has to offer.
I know he wasnt looking for sympathy, but I couldnt help but feel for this man.
These people flipped his life upside down and was the cause of losing the things he loved.
How can you not hate someone who made you lose all of that?
This man has been through so much and I couldnt help but feel it was all of our fault.
He has come to terms with it and has learned to forgive and I think thats the most admirable thing Ive ever heard.
Although my heart was breaking in this class, I learned a lot about the power of forgiveness.
He asked that we all become more aware of the life that exists outside of what were used to, or what we call home.
We often listen to what is being thrown at us, sometimes forgetting to further research and then form our own opinions on the matter.
In my high school, we were required to take 3 years of different US History courses, but never the option to take courses that covered the history of other countries.
Although I do not think that Bassim way of thinking is rare.
But sit there and ask yourself this questions.
So when we have our oil then Saddam Hussain is a good man?
Ordinary people like Bassim do not care who their leader is, who is in their country, what rules they might need to follow as long as they can feed their families and they are safe.
Even though he was the victim of a horrible tragedy that cost him the lives of his daughter, wife, brother, nephew, and dog, he was able to find the strength to move on and continue living.
This is why a price tag cannot be put on lives - because it greatly diminishes their value.
Though no one will ever know whether it was simply luck, fate, or divine intervention that kept Bassim alive, I believe that he will inspire others so that in the future, a tragedy like this can be avoided.
For somebody to endure what Bassim has gone through and still not hold any anger or hate inside of him is amazing.
Just trying to imagine a similar situation would leave many people looking for ways to exact some sort of retaliation against those who have harmed them.
I can only hope that Bassim continues to find happiness in his life and that he can use his story to influence others.
Rafi is definitely a very brave man for standing for what he believes even It goes against barbaric people such as the Taliban.
Listening to Rafi is inspirational because it shows determination and purpose.
It is important to learn more about issues from all over the globe and to listen to different perspectives on each individual issue, only by doing that you can formulate your own individual opinion of the subject.
I do believe that education is the greatest tool to change the world properly so we should be educated about all subjects and we should encourage learning to engage in a battle of arguments and not a battle of weapons and war.
I feel the exact same way each and every Soc 119 class I walk into, not knowing what to expect or what Sam will say.
And now after listening to Bassim share his story he has made it clear just how important it is to not let anger restrict us and that is something that will and should be carried along with all of us through life as a lesson to live by.
He has had so much taken from him for no reason and hes still able to say he has no hate in his heart towards us Americans.
Its how I view bullying in a way, you either be a bigger person when faced with it or you let the bully turn you into a bully yourself.
Hearing Basimsstory firsthand was unlike anything Ive experienced before.
And on our parts we need to be more awake when watching the news and realize that there are people with families and lives on the other side of those bombs we see on tv.
Extremist groups in the Middle East are giving muslims a bad reputation whenever they attack innocent people in the name of Islam, but we should not be blaming the attacks on all Muslims.
He had lost his family, yet he had come to peace with everything that had happened to him.
To be able to live on in a positive way that something that is special and what really separates him from a the average person.
In this video, he mentions that his lecture material often changes due to economic and problem around the society.
I agree that there should be no body of knowledge that holds a believe about the general problem such as racial and gender problems.
I think this is important idea because having a body of knowledge about somethings might prevent us to think farther and understanding other ideas.
Also, he mentions that he talks about Islam a lot because he is trying to make people more comfortable about the Muslim.
We also have problem about thinking that only Muslim is a problem.
However, we need to think about what happened before.
We cant generalize about the Muslim in general just by looking at people who commit terror and killing that is going on these days.
I really enjoyed having class while facetiming Basim.
In the video, a student asked what changes in their country occurred when ISIS came intro Iraq.
As Bosim said, they completely changed their way of life.
Its crazy to think about how much power ISIS holds and makes me wonder when this will all stop, and if anything could be done to end the constant terror and fear.
Iraq is many people's home, and it is unfortunate that they have to live the way that they do.
Everyone wants their family to have a good life, and everyone deserves to be able to give their family that.
You brought up some really interesting ideas that added to that class' particular discussion for me.
First off, I think your point about not letting a skinny book dictate one's life too much.
If we can begin to shine a bigger light on the hypocrisy of Christian Sharia in America, I think that would go a long way in improving race ethnic relations.
When individuals, myself included, as well as the media, take a more open-minded stance on things we don't know, only then will this country begin to make lasting progress in this arena.
The video chat with Bassim was I think the most honest and eye opening class I have been to yet.
They think about us, so we need to start thinking of them in the same ways.
First, the chance to get hear from someone that has been negatively impacted by the United States actions is something that is really eye opening.
To hear about losing his parts of his family caused by something we did is truly sickening.
It had even more of an impact on me when Sam opened up the conversation for questions.
What happened to his family was tragic and it is arguably reasonable to be angry at the country that caused it.
Forgiveness is something that I believe helps heal even the deepest of wounds.
Yes, its easy to blame an entire country for their governments actions, but to look beyond what everyone thinks is the answer to see that everyone is different is key.
We come from all walks of life like he mentions in the video and it can be hard to look past our actions to really see that who we really are.
His outlook on forgiveness really makes me think about how I choose to react to negative events in my life.
I can not think of something that I am that passionate about.
I dont know many people who are that passionate about anything.
Maybe it is the concept of money that prevents this passion for certain subjects.
It is hard to live in a world where money is so important and still pursue something that doesnt make money like trying to instill peace.
I too was amazed that a man that with stood amazing pain and loss could not be angry with the United States, especially after the shoty response given by the authorities and minute compensation.
Most who are interviewed or retell their story often talk out the grace and protection of God that helped them through those tough times.
But for those who firmly deny the existence of a higher being how do they cope with the experience.
Similarly, I wonder how many who are religious have done the opposite under the same circumstances.
My guess would be more of the former than the latter, but people in the latter are often less inclined to admit it than the former.
Basim could easily hate America for what happened to his family.
He could easily be filled with hate every day of his life.
At first, this seems impossible; to have nearly everything you love taken away from you and still to find happiness in life.
But my aunts strength has shown me that it is possible to continue on after such a tragedy.
Although the death of his wife, daughter, brother, and nephew has left an eternal bruise on his heart, Basim has found acceptance and forgiveness within him.
He is an extremely kind-hearted man who elicits an impressive amount of courage, which is why I am extremely grateful to have had the opportunity to witness this conversation with him.
I am very surprised that he was not upset with the United States, because, quite frankly, I was at that point.
Not only that, but they tried sweeping the problem under the carpet by not making a huge deal out of it and gaving the survivors an embarrassingly low and demoralizing amount of money.
Ive never heard any stories about the impact of our military other than what you hear in the media, which is generally positive.
The passages that were chosen were more violent then often associated with these texts and the people on the streets often chose the link the violent passages to the Quran claiming that it was more violent than the Bible.
I know some of the more popular stories from when I use to attend CCD as a kid but other than that my familiarity with the Bible is limited.
I do however understand that much of what is said in the Bible is of the time is was written.
They only follow the parts that will benefit their lives and that coincide with their beliefs.
This is a dangerous way of making guidelines for ones life.
Life is more complicated then thou shalt not kill because what about self defense?
There are so many ideas that are outdated, for example stoning people for punishment.
But even so, people will pick and chose which is dangerous.
He isn't mad at Americans for what happened.
He didn't generalize the people of the country for what the people of their government did to him.
If the roles had been reversed many Americans would have not found it in their hearts to forgive anyone especially Afghanis.
All we hear on the news these days is how Trump is offended by certain individuals not respecting his way of ruling or certain celebrities being pregnant, really small things that we shouldn't care about but are projected.
This prevents us from finding about the truth about our country and the actually news we should be focusing on like how our government bombed Bassim's house.
We truly are not the greatest country, probably far from it and that fact that many Americans think that we are is horrifying.
Countless atrocities occurred in the past, yet no justice has been delivered.
Would people really agree to these wars if they knew how many civilians were slaughtered?
If we are free, how do we have the highest incarceration rate in the world?
All the speech that he give to the class really made me think.
I am really looking forward for what will be coming after.
It is shameful that we have evolved to empathize for those who are so close to us, yet we are so quick falsely judge those far from us based off a few acts out of a fraction of a percent of Muslims.
He said he was numb for a couple of months after his wife died and for the next two months, he was very angry.
But then he realized that the anger was eating him from inside.
Being angry at something that has already happened will definitely not make you happy.
People make mistakes but it is up to individuals like us to decide whether or not to forgive.
He also says that the governments were responsible for whatever happened to him and not the people.
But it is the people stay the same.
My first impression was amazement, because of how easy it was for the entire class to communicate and ask questions to Bassim regardless of the fact he is thousands of miles away in Afghanistan.
In a practical sense, it is nearly impossible for one to live such a life where they follow all the ideals and laws of God 100% of the time.
It is the desire of most people to find meaning in their life through the acceptance of a universal plan based on the nature of love and goodness.
One of the videos that really grabbed my attention was Radicalizing the Bible.
Given that the Quran and Bible are similar throughout Id imagine that if the Bible was used to convey laws we would have many of the same problems and conflicts that Muslims, especially overseas, face.
Its seems crazy that the main thing that separates normal Muslims and groups like ISIS comes down to interpretation of the Quran.
Whos to say if the Bible was used to in a Sharia Law type use that we wouldnt have radical groups emerge.
Though this is only one problem I feel that many similar would emerge.
Areas and topics that are subjective like alcohol use, premarital sex, altruism, abortion, killing in self defense; all which Sam mentioned in class would come down to what the Bible says.
The fact that laws are cut and dry, black and white is what offers clarity and lack of ambiguity.
If the Bible was used for Sharia Law I feel there would be a lack of our unique opinions.
I feel Americans live in their own little bubble and they do not see the horrific events that happen outside of it.
Americans understand that a war is going on but I believe that they do not know that it affects people just like them.
People in Afghanistan are dying every day but the media never allows us to hear about it.
Basims life was flipped upside down the day that the United States bombed his house that killed his wife, daughter, brother, nephew, and dog.
I believe you can grasp the pain that war causes by walking in the shoes of another person who experiences it.
We hear death toll numbers all the time, but thats the thing theyre just numbers.
For me, Bassims talk with us helped me to turn all those facts and figures I hear into people and places.
I think we can take a life lesson from Bassim in not being so filled with hatred.
I also admired Bassims way of placing blame.
But rather, he knew the source of the act came from our government, so he blames them.
This was such a thought provoking answer for me because, as a Christian, I was thinking about how I would personally react to this situation.
I feel as though frustration mixed with determination to produce the ideal result,at an institution, rather than individuals, yields better results if one is hoping to bring about change in the system.
I think today it is so hard to change people's beliefs because like you said we all grow up with them.
You say without the ability to accept difference, people will never understand each other fully.
People need to accept that not everyone is the same and like you said if we can't do this, then we won't understand each other.
Sam said that if this was said in difference societies or if the religion where substituted for Jew or Muslim, the backlash would be so much greater, and its really the desensitization of the public to statements like this in society that are really frightening especially when these politicians run the direction of the country.
I think what Basim advised us to do is really important and one could only wish that these videos of him speaking could go viral or something.
It should become a requirement and while its not we then have to do further research ourselves and not take the medias word on every little thing.
I couldnt ever imagine experiencing something even close to what Bassim had gone through.
In my opinion there is no monetary value that could make me just want to move on from a tragic event, especially with the case of Bassim.
I completely agree to your point on this distortion in the way we see others.
Theres this saying that when you point a finger at someone, there are three other fingers pointing back at yourself.
When religions and other races choose to point the finger, they never acknowledge that this is happening in their group too.
It may not make a big difference right away, but it certainly could help some.
It really helps to hear how other perspectives feel because then we see this challenge of our beliefs being the end all be all way and potentially see how others see it.
By having such conversations, these beliefs can hopefully start to break down this way weve chosen to live by for so long.
I mean, I remember listening to him in class talk about his wife and daughter being killed but for some reason I couldnt get this idea out of my head for quite some time even though it wasnt even mentioned.
I just thought it was strange it didnt really register as to how bad it that would genuinely destroy me inside and out.
Maybe at the time it was really just a lot of information I not only wasnt prepared for but had no prior interest at all in regretfully, but without even him mentioning it that fact somehow flipped a switch in my head that really brought me to a saddened train of thought.
They really like to bring a heavy focus on what's bad but conveniently forget to add the good parts or silver linings.
Growing up I always thought people from the middle east didn't care for Americans because of how things were portrayed on the news.
I discovered this was wrong when I met one of my current best friends.
We really have to question the things we hear and see and find out for ourselves if it is true.
I thought it was so cool to hear from someone who was directly affected by the war and has so many stories to tell.
Basim mentioned how ISIS entered Mosul and started converting it to something that it was not before.
Basim left Mosul when his house was bombed and he lost everything.
The images shown while Basim was speaking showed what the city of Mosul used to look like, and what the city looks like now.
The media simply does not report all of the terrible things that happen and it makes me reconsider how we get our information.
I loved hearing everything Basim talked about and look forward to listening to more speakers in the future.
I cant even imagine what these people go through and all of the things they must have to sacrifice for their families or even just themselves.
Rafi telling his story was very touching and inspiring, and I really felt moved by everything he said.
The skill of empathy does not only extend to your family members or neighbors, but it extends to those who you would consider to be nothing like you.
As Sam talked about, people are so quick to think of Muslim people as violent and hateful, but fail to realize Christians have done the same things.
I think the reason we are able to overlook the hate and violence from people who identify as Christian is because we also know Christians that do not have the same values as the KKK or other white Christian hate groups.
Therefore there is no difference when it comes to denying the hate groups from each religion to identify as it.
Just because you follow a certain religion, it does not make you a good or bad person.
I do not believe that your religion defines who you are, therefore people should not be discriminated and stereotyped through what they identify with and believe.
Although this is easier said than done, with more awareness of the similarities with people outside of your own religion, these stereotypes can begin to diminish in social presence.
When I was young I never really put the pieces together as to why we were invading Iraq; we werent just invading Iraq because of the recent terrorist attacks on the United States.
We were invading Iraq because we wanted their oil.
I feel that when Sam explained it this way it all made more sense to me.
In my opinion 9 11 gave the government another reason on top of wanting Iraqi oil to invade Iraq, and as shallow as it may sound, I think that they used 9 11 as an excuse to invade Iraq to get what they really wanted.
Sam also allowed us to see the war in Iraq from the perspective of those who lived there.
This was very interesting for me because I never really understood the life that people were able to live while this huge war was going on right in their front yard and how they felt about the United States invading Iraq.
When you think about it from their perspective and not our own it makes sense as to why they were angry.
When I thought about it like this it made me feel angry, I was able to realize that I too would be angry if another country invaded the U.S. to take our resources, its not fair.
And this is when Sam described that there are really two main uses of the military, one is to protect and the other is to do business.
When we invaded Iraq thats just what we were doing using our military to retaliate against 9 11 and we were using it to make money by stealing Iraqi oil.
When our peer asked the question about his feelings towards us, I was not expecting the answer he gave.
If I were to ever be in the same position as Basim, I do not think I would have forgiven the other country.
He has every right to be furious towards us and I felt so ashamed of what we did to him.
I admire your comment about if more people were to be more like Basim, we would all live in a better, more peaceful place.
But, I guess we all have something we always wear no matter what, that makes us feel complete.
So, thinking of it that way made total sense.
It was so inspiring to see, when the girls tried the hijabs on they actually felt something very unexpected.
We need to make these conversations happen more, we all assume but never go straight to the person who we make assumptions about.
I admire them so much for that, and thankful we all got the opportunity to hear their opinion.
One of the girls said she wears it proudly and men have some traditions to abide by as well.
I wish some days I could just tell myself that the outside really isnt that important and modesty should come within.
No matter how much you cover or dont, the personality and thinking wont be affected.
I agree with your reply and also think it is really cool to see how Sam and Bassim can communicate using technology.
Being able for them to stay in touch is so amazing and a really cool teaching experience for Sam.
The idea is really cool because it is allowing you to make a connection with someone from a completely different background and culture.
You can share different stories and also explain what goes on in the part of the world where you are writing from.
I also agree with your point on how it benefitting us because we can understand what is going on in different parts of the world where maybe we had an opinion that was wrongfully told to us.
Many of the things he said stood out but I think the most shocking thing he said was an answer to when he was asked why he wasnt angrier with the United States.
He said that he was numb at first and then he was angry, and then he thought that anger would eat him from the inside and it was harming him more than it was helping him so he chose to forgive.
This is such a powerful message that I think is important for anyone to understand.
Not only was his house destroyed, but his wife, daughter and brother were killed as well, and he chose to forgive.
I cant even fathom how I would react if I was in that situation, but I definitely would not forgive the country who killed my family.
Obviously forgiveness is hard when someone you love is killed, but if people began to learn to forgive others for certain actions, the world would be a better place in my opinion.
Its hard for me to talk on this matter because in my life I have not really lost anyone super important to me.
When Basim said that right after the incident, he was numb and lifeless, I felt an emotion change inside of me and my views of war and world peace.
I think the part of this video that struck me the most was when Basim said that anger was eating him up and he needed to move on.
Wouldnt it be nice if every country just left each other alone.
Most people around the world believe in forgiveness and that's what their religion teaches them.
Im not a religious person myself, but I really liked hearing about how similar the Muslim religion is compared to the Christian religion.
I dont think there is ever such thing as being a perfect Christian or a perfect Muslim because everyone interprets their religions in their own way.
I think as long as youre a good person and youre doing what you think is right, youre living a good life.
He easily could live the rest of his life with complete hatred towards the United States because the US Army destroyed his home and killed off most of his family, but the fact that he doesn't shows how mentally strong Basim is and his character as a man.
He says that his anger rests with the governments involved in this conflict, which is completely understandable.
I'm not going to tell Basim how to live his life, but I think he should have some anger about what happened to him.
The admirable part of this is that Basim didn't blindly decide to carry out a long-term grudge towards every American citizen; he recognized that they helped him out in a major time of need, so the least he can do is reward them with his respect as humans.
I was more shocked that not everyone realized this, its so disturbing that we have to take a class in order to understand the importance of another human being sitting half way across the world.
What Bassim said was absolutely true.
Bassim mentioned how he feels that in America we arent taught enough about geography and other countries which is part of the issue.
But do you think teaching about other countries in school will make a difference?
So how can we get people to actually care?
However, I do really think we need to start.
And if so, how do they do this?
This shouldnt have to be the case but it is.
We should also care about the daily lives of the people who live there.
I agree with your idea about we have to find a common ground between other culture and my culture so that I can be easier to relate it.
It is very hard for us to relate things that we are not familiar with.
We need to learn more about the things that we dont recognize.
We can be more open and get more comfortable with the people from Muslim if we talk about them more and encounter them more.
What I am trying to get across here is that experience matters a lot.
I am really glad that in our classroom we get to talk about Muslim because through discussing their culture and their society, the idea of them changed a lot.
Meeting someone from Iraq, who has had an attack made on his family and himself makes the conflict over in Iraq seem more real and personal.
This is the reason I chose this clip.
My immediate first question for Bassim was how does he deal with any resentment or anger he might have.
I know that if I were to lose nearly my entire family, I would sink into a depression, or be overly angry with the world, not just the government.
During that response, I tweeted on the soc119 hashtag How does one continue after something like a bomb?
Knowing also, after watching this clips, that Bassim accredits his forgiveness to his religion.
This type of teaching is common, but most associate it with extremist Islam.
However, when you choose to ignore teachings of love, unity, and forgiveness like Bassim has learned you have your own opinions of what the religion has to be.
Maybe the only thing we need is to forgive.
My response is to the video of Basim Razzo when he said he was not angry with America.
He needed to forgive in order to feel better and be able to live his life.
So many people in America condemn the Islamic religion but it is their ignorance that makes them feel this way.
I too loved the comparison that Sam made between the new testament and the bible.
He discusses many of the similarities between the faith's and the things they call for.
People will always scoff like that kid behind you did, it is difficult to accept that you may be like the very people you speak negatively about.
It is this refusal to accept blame that causes even more issues and makes the problem bigger.
I first saw that he was very calm but also sounded and looked a little sad.
He spoke very fondly of his daughter and wife, which was nice to hear.
He said that forgiveness was something that he had to do for himself and because of his religion.
In Islam, it is a big thing to be able to forgive people for wrongs that have done to you.
Basim wasn't angry with Americans but he does realize that there is a problem within the US government.
His ability to differentiate the two was impressive to me because I would think most people would automatically couple the two.
Basim continues to live his life because he knows that time waits for no one.
Some of hisfamily was taken from him too soon but he said he realizes he has his son and his daughter-in-law.
So, he believes that he can't live in the past and has to keep moving to be able to actually live a fulfilled life.
I am equally as disappointed in the hatred our human race has for each other as you are.
I cannot act as though I am innocent in all of this.
But in many cases people have taken it to an extreme; an extreme where some cannot simply look at another without mentally pointing out differences and imperfections.
Im sure we can all think of someone we know who hands out more insults than they do compliments.
I think people like this are worsening our progression to a more accepting society.
In the case of judging people based on their race, our society must recognize that all races are capable of good, not just bad.
In America and other countries, we need more of an emphasis on this in order to make up for all the stereotypes our media has given to the Afghan and Iraqi people.
That being said, it is common for people who obtain jobs in the city to move to my home town to start families and commute to work on the local train.
Therefore, I had a lot of friends who had parents that worked work there.
Shortly after, they realized that, because we were just a mile or two across the water, that were may not be safe.
So we packed up and left.
A lot of the comments, responses, or questions that you heard from the oppressed whites are statements that echo the feelings and mindset of many African Americans in the United States.
You likely did not grow up hearing these opinions or thoughts around you so that is why it was difficult for you to understand.
This was inspiring and so respectful to have someone who lost almost everything to even give us students the time of day and to say hes not angry with us.
I thought it was incredible for him to acknowledge that some of us may be unaware or uninformed about some things he deals with all the time, but in a nonjudgmental way.
So it was nice to have someone say hey be more aware but without any anger or resentment.
Overall, to have someone who should have so much anger towards us tell us honestly and kindly to be more aware inspires me to listen.
I walked around with this thought in my head that America is one of the greatest countries on Earth and that essentially we couldn't do wrong.
Hearing this lecture was very interesting and eye opening for me because even though I never found my family to be outwardly racist, I realized that I was taught to not speak about it or question issues.
I think seeing it in such a different light was really important for me not because I believed in how racism isnt real but I needed to see the statistics to know what is really going on in the world.
It was frightening to me because I was taught things that I blatantly did not believe.
When growing up in the society we are in now, we all know that there are problems and the only way to fix it is to come together.
I know that racism is still very prominent in our society but I was never exposed to the statistics of it being that bad.
I think that is a problem that everyone has.
They are all very much republican and they are very near sighted when it comes to seeing what is really there.
His daughter, brother and wife were killed when the American government bombed his house as well as his brothers house.
I remember tearing the entire time he spoke.
He shared how difficult the times have been, and how he turns to faith for hope and love.
His story was moving and truly does make you want to personally invest time in broadening your awareness to international affairs and how they affect normal families too.
I cannot believe how positive he was today after losing almost everything he had in his life.
But, as Basim said, life goes on anyway so why should I stay angry the rest of my life, so he forgave.
I was baptized christian as a baby, but grew up going to Catholic Churches.
It never really grew on me and my dad's side was very hardcore Croatian Catholics and I think they definitely contributed to my lack of interest in christianity or being Catholic.
But from this lecture I got to learn a lot more.
Just like Sam said, just because we don't know its happening doesn't mean it isn't.
But when we see events like a mass school shootings and these white kids who do this are religious and commit acts of terrorism yet we don't label them as terrorists.
Itisn't just limited to Muslims so,Ithink we need to start labeling these acts of terrorism when they needto be labeled.
Not just to muslims but to these white kids who are committing acts of hate.
The U.S military had accidentally dropped a missile on his house resulting in the death of his wife, daughter, and dog, in addition to injuring the man.
What truly shocked me about this class was the response that this man had towards this tragedy.
He mentioned how he had been severely depressed and angry for a long time and that he never thought he would forgive the U.S government for what they had done to him.
He thought that, regardless of the magnitude, humans will always come to a point of progression where they find a way to omit a moment of calamity in their life.
To a man who had lost everything, this was truly impacting.
Furthermore, this person is one of many from the middle east who have suffered from this form of distress as a cause of U.S military attacks; maybe some individuals even worse.
But even with this burden weighing them down, they still find a way to forget it and simply advance in their life.
In the end, to American citizens, it seems like these middle eastern people are the only ones who inflict pain on us and not the other way around, but in reality, us Americans have probably done more damage to them.
I thought that at one point he would want to join ISIS for the fact that Americans did that to his home.
Not all the people that were affected by the United Sates bombings feel the same way that Basim does I am sure.
I am positive that some people become so filled with hate that they ultimately end up join ISIS.
Personally if was in the same situation he was, seeing my wife and pet die before me, I would be filled with so much anger that I wouldve probably joined ISIS.
What made the situation even worse is that the United States government only offered 1500 dollars per life.
I feel as if the whole thing from the administration point of view is very computerized.
He was just another case that they had to deal with and his family members were just another casualty of war.
It took a lot of him to forgive America but from seeing him through skype I can tell that he has found peace.
If he can forgive America for murdering his entire family then we should be able to forgive each other for the little things.
I feel like this lecture has been the most effective to me so far.
This guy who graduated from the US and had such a western culture and then all the sudden, during the Iraqi war he lost four of his family members.
Frankly, seeing this guy smiles and laughs with Sam who is American really pushed me forward and gave me a moment to stop and think for a moment about the world.
Basim's words were quite remarkable and outstanding when he was asked about what keeps him going after this.
He said you just have to keep living which tells you how he had tried desperately to get justice and a sort of a refund for the damages, but without an outcome.
This taught me the lesson that if I really want to see the world a better place, then I have to consider that the cost of my wife's life is the same as my neighbor's or another person and that we are equal and %99 the same.
Living in America my whole life and having no one in my close family or friend groups that had served, I have never been directly affected by the tragedies of war.
No one would ever address the casualties or humanize the people who were being affected.
I think the realization of its a real place with real people gives a whole new perspective on war that, if everyone could see, there would be no need for violence.
It is a shame because I never really felt unsafe or experienced true fear in America; yet, innocent people just like me across the world lose their lives to war.
Everyone in this world is a human being who should be allowed to dream and not only that should be given a chance to follow those dreams.
What I found most interesting about talking to Bassim was the fact that he was not mad.
If I were him I think I would be mad.
But when he started talking about how he understood that American people are just people and that his feelings toward the disaster that happened to him and his family was directed at politics.
Who I thought of when Sam pulled up the slide titled Christian Sharia.
The Bible says abstinence is the only moral birth control so the law should prohibit schools from handing out condoms.
Why are theyokay while Islamic Sharia is dangerous and evil?
If lawmakers are notbasing their morality on a higher power, what are they basing it on?
I always thought people who didn't understand why Church and State should be separate were radical and uneducated, but this part of classmade me flip the script.
Both are so small and, to quote Sam, do not address all the complexities of life.
How arehumans qualified to interpret the word of God?
After reading through your and other's responses I think it is pretty clear that most of us found Basim to be one of if not the most eye opening experiences to take place in our class.
I love what you said about Basims anger and how it much his forgiveness meant to you because I had the exact same reaction.
For such a strong emotion hate rarely accomplishes much, and what it does achieve is generally pretty negative.
Over all really insightful response and I like how you ended with how you were inspired with change because I feel like that is Sams whole idea.
Being in the US, we very rarely get first hand accounts of what really happens in the middle east.
Usually when we think about the middle east, we think of run down, fully military area, with little commerce.
Basim brought into perspective what Iraq really looks like.
His chilling story gives us an idea of the chaos that has been newly awakened due to recent interventions in the area.
To further this, when asked if he had hope for the future, Basim immediately noted that he did not.
It is sad to see that a whole generation will potentially be devastated due to a domino effect of actions that have taken place in the middle east over the past 15 years.
When this group takes over a city, they embed their religion deep into everyday lives of the people.
This severely reduced the everyday freedoms that people have in the area.
It is almost as if Iraq is not even in control of its own destiny.
This is really where the hopelessness comes from.
It is a feeling of powerlessness that is a result of years of government shifts and instability.
For an American Christian to say Islamic people are only group that have extremists is just a flat out uneducated statement.
To predetermine how someone might behave solely based off of their religion or beliefs is a mistake.
The reality is, regardless of anyones religion or whatever they believe in, you dont know anything about them until you interact with them.
I have grown more interested in Afghanistan and I would definitely like to go there some day.
I also really like how Sam said this class would be all about empathy.
Almost exactly like how people from different areas root for different sports teams.
I would also love to learn more about Buddhism.
I feel like they are two cultures that are rooted in very peaceful beliefs, something this current day needs more of.
idk, to me it seems like a pretty easy choice when I get to that point.
The fact that he has seen the good in Americans when he studied here helps him to know that not everyone is like that.
His positivity and outlook is truly something extraordinary, not everyone can handle it the way he does.
But, thats exactly why we need more people like Bassim in this world.
We need to realize a specific a religion or race isnt at fault.
It really is sad to think that the media can manipulate so many people's way of thinking, and that finding out the real story takes so much more effort than it should.
One of the main responsibilities of the media should be to give people the full, correct, unbiased truth of what's going on in the world, but since it has so much influence, it is used as a tool to push agendas and different viewpoints on certain audiences.
Although Donald Trump (unfortunately) won the election,Clinton won the popular vote, so it's clear to see that the media pushing this agenda clearly worked.
And the lesson he ended our lecture with is something I think most Americans should take to heart.
A man of a different religion and a man of a different country, yet he reached out to Sam, and choose to be on screen sharing his experiences with us.
We live in a world full of uniquely different people, and it should be our duty as humans sharing this planet to learn more about each other.
With the advent of information age and the wealth of resources available to us as Americans, we are able to be more connected than ever.
To do otherwise would be choosing to remain ignorant.
Never before has the world been so open to us.
If we can have more educated dialogues, like the ones Sam and Bassim provide, perhaps we can move past them.
Bassos experience was so heartbreaking and saddening, I absolutely had no idea how he had the heart in him to forgive.
However with more deep thought, I realized it is a lot easier to forgive than have hate.
Anger has the power to control your life in such a negative aspect and no positive change can come from it.
If everyone used their strength to forgive, we could strive to find better understanding and how we can improve our society.
It is very interesting that women have to provide specific reasons as to why they want to get a divorce from their spouse.
There are four different reasons that allows for a divorce, but because they are so specific it could be very difficult to find a way out of your marriage for something more simple, such as just being unhappy or not getting along.
Something so simple here is almost hard to do a place like Afghanistan.
In the United States, we take many things for granted that are difficult to achieve elsewhere.
I agree with what youre saying here Laura.
Being a Christian as well, I understood what Sam was saying too about how the Bible and the Sharia could be interpreted in so many different ways.
I also do not think people should use the Bible or the Sharia for a law making guide because some people may interpret each thing differently.
I also thought it was so interesting too what Sam told us about what Mike Pence said.
Not many people reacted to him saying he was first off a Christian and then once Sam compared it to someone saying first off Im Jewish it really struck me how out of line it was for him to start off with that.
As well as not to mention in a previous class Sam talked about the exclusion clause so Pence really should not be involving religion in his politics or the government at all.
I think that his response speaks a lot about him as a person, Islam as a religion, and humans as a whole.
No matter who you are it takes a special person to come out of losing their family and not feel anger no matter how long it has been.
Not only must Basim be wired to have benevolence, but also he credits the fact that he is a Muslim.
The fact hat we want to be happy and have the ability to forgive is amazing.
I feel it is really important for people to have some empathy and they should get to know what the other person feels and should respect their opinion.
Sometimes a few people are straight up intolerant to other people's opinion, religious beliefs and they try to impose and enforce their ideas on to the other person.
Also Sam brought up a point that there are Humans with normal life going on just like the United States.
It was a chilling moment when I came to know that the United States was responsible for killing the family members of Mr.Bassim and their houses.
Sometimes I used to wonder why the United States government used to poke their noses into the issues of other country's internal matters.
In this case, I realise that it is all because of the oil present in the middle east countries.
But the government should also know that millions of people are involved in the matter and many are getting ruined because of this.
Because there are many other people living in the world, but not all of them have the same access to the facilities which you might be receiving.
I thought what you said was really interesting.
I dont have any family members currently serving our country currently, but both my grandfathers had.
Americans say they go into war to protect their freedom and those who cant protect their own, but thats not really true.
They help because they have something to gain and profit from.
Men and women in America fought literally because our government wanted to profit from the oil reserves.
It makes me so mad to think about this and all the messed up things that happen in our government.
People say other countries have a corrupt government and that America is so great and has so many opportunities.
After hearing Bassims heartbreaking story about the U.S. military bombings that killed his loved ones, I was sad for him.
As hopeless as it sounds, I would be ruined.
However, Bassim said he realized that being angry did nothing but make things worse for him.
I feel as though in times like these, its best to have faith and turn to religion in hopes of finding reason.
I have had experiences in my life when sometimes its easier to sulk and be angry at the world rather than look for a brighter alternative.
However, after hearing Bassims story and his experience, Ive realized that life can be ugly sometimes but it should never stop one from living their life.
If one chooses not to forgive, hate and anger will eat away at them and ruin their life.
The world we live in experiences terrible tragedies, and its time we start to forgive and hopefully make a change.
Countries do so much to each other, destroying homes, killing family members, but the innocent civilians still have a positive outlook on their life.
It is something very inspiring and something we should all strive to do.
That is something that really stood out to me because a lot of the time we don't think of it in that sense.
I praise people like Bassim who witness such horrific events happen and not take that out on other people.
Seeing people's reactions in the audience is also very moving.
It makes you think what you could do differently outside of your small little bubble.
Something also that is really important that Bassim did was realize that it wasn't the American peoples fault well not all of ours.
Within those 8 years all he had seen from us Americans, were good people; The problem he has is with the government.
He uses his religion to guide him through his life.
This is something very interesting to me because here in America, insomepeople's eyes, unfortunately, Muslims are not seen in a positive light.
Nowadays we do a bad job at causing one persons bad actions to change our opinion on that entire group.
I agree with your point that we do not utilize our technology in order to expand our potential of learning about other societies to the extent we should.
It is actions outside of the classroom that must be taken in order to at least stay caught up with the world.
Whether it is in communist China where much of the internet is off limits, or America who reports simply what they want their viewers to know.
Probably a whole lot of self-incriminating information about caucasians, who were able to erase their bloody history as it happened.
As Sam discussed, it is difficult for many to understand they are not outside of the hate in the world.
I doubt that in my lifetime I will ever see a country that fully accomplished morality and equality in media information.
Hearing and reading the stories of those who are have struggled is what instills then message in our minds.
I had never put much thought into womens rights in Afghanistan.
But the Saudi women explained that it wasnt oppressive in any way, it is just their religion to cover up in front of men that arent their immediate family.
Also, I can quite understand what he was saying from an experience of when I was younger.
It was to a point where I was starting to have negative feelings towards North Koreans.
I did not look into what was actually happening in that country.
I never knew that the citizens were struggling, and most importantly I did not know the cruelty against them if they wanted to stand up for themselves.
Also, hearing the stories of escaped North Koreans brought tears to my eyes.
Now we have Trump, who has thought of sending more troops back into the conflict but is much more concerned with a North Korean nuclear threat.
We entered the conflict because we were provoked.
We took military action and while doing so attempted to better the lives of the innocent citizens involved.
Id imagine not all the people who have been subject to unbelievable events like Bassim have the same thoughts as him.
LinkTo begin, I thought this particular class was quite emotional.
I cannot even imagine to have a completely normal life one day and then lose almost everything and everyone that is important.
If I was Bassim I would not be able to go day feeling second hand guilt.
I chose this video in particular because I thought that every word of this advice he gave was valid and made me realize.
Bassim told us to be aware of people and places that are not the United States.
He also brings up the point of the media in the United States controls everyone.
The thing that shocked me was him saying while he was in England, they knew more about what was going on the world then the American people just because it showed the lack of awareness America had had.
I believe this advice was one of the best pieces of advice one could give to college students.
We are the future of America and you have to start small to make something big.
It was horrible to see how much this poor man had endured throughout his life.
He lost his home, and the people who meant the world to him.
Everything he lost laid in the hands of the United States government and they were the ones to blame when everything was said and done.
I could never forgive someone who striped everything I had away from me.
It is safe to say that most people would feel the same way I would and would associate a stigma with all Americans being evil.
He said he had friends that lived in the United States and that he's visited and felt no hard feelings towards them.
After being angry for a few months, he realized how much more that was hurting him than benefitting him.
Lastly, it was heroic that he forgave because of his religion and didn't allow something that destroyed him to end the happiness in his life.
The constant battle of things that happened in the past keep our world torn and divided.
Each person has his or her own thoughts on the subject and takes a different view.
Something that even the writer had not meant to accomplish, a reader could understand after reading.
That being said, there are things written in the bible that I agree with and things written that I do not agree with.
The few passages that I strongly like are the ones I try to base my life off.
It is common for humans to only take away the things we want to and only focus on certain parts of things.
(That is why of course there are judges to determine these tricky cases).
Trying to use just the Bible, as a guide to life is impossible as well.
Then, I was angry for a few months but I felt that the anger would just eat me from the inside.
I have friends who are Americans who took me inside their house.
I have no problems with any American because all I saw were good people.
I am a Muslim and my religion tells me to forgive and I always use my religion to guide me through my life.
I agree, people only take out and follow what they want to believe.
This struck a chord with me because I think it speaks to how we need to be more open minded and accept other viewpoints because nobody can understand all of the aspects that go into these situations and the myriad of factors that attribute to social issues in our nation.
People tend to believe that what they think is right and they do not listen to the other sides argument and that in lies one of the major issues in this country I believe.
If we surround ourselves with people who look like us and think like us than we will never grow and we will never see what else is out there.
It is ignorant to think that what you believe is right and not take the time to question your own beliefs and give thought to the ideas of others.
You could almost hear the crickets in the room when Sam said that these women felt empowered.
I never thought that the hijab oppressed these women.
Te fact that it was our governments fault for the death of Basim's family and thought that only $2,000 would be enough to cover the damage which they have created in his life disgusts me.
It was our governments own fault that this tragedy occurred, therefore, it is their job to fix it, not insult the people.
I understand that Basim does not hate the American people, but what about the American government?
Our government should have double, triple checked everything they did, especially with a bomb.
I am ashamed that our government would let something like this happen and repay Basim with disrespect.
The video that impacted me most in the past two weeks is the video in which Basim Razzo talked about not being angry at Americans.
When something so awful happens, it can be easy to just hate the country itself, but he was able to put that hatred aside and still speak to his American friends he had made.
I feel like it gave me a new outlook on the war efforts and made me think more about the decisions our country makes when sending people to war.
It is guys like Basim who make the world the better place to live.
That definitely helps in having a sound mind and is also good for your health.
And speaking about your last point, it is very important to have information about the things happening all around the world and not only in the country that we live in.
It also helps us know what the people in that region are actually going through.
I agree with what you were saying that sometimes it is just easier to sugar coat life and say that things will get better.
It was shocking to me also that he responded this way.
Especially a man his age I would expect him to be shining a light on the next generation giving them something to look forward to.
His statement that he doesnt see it getting better just shows how bad the way of life has been changed.
I personally know so many people that blame every Muslim person they see for terrorism.
Even though the majority of terrorism that occurs in our country is not even caused by those who are Muslim.
Well I think we all know the answer to that one but how can they not see the flaw in their way of thinking?
I feel only a part of this is because they do not even try to associate with those from other ethnicities.
Basims story was so alarming to me at first because it made me question how many other times incidences like this occur.
But then I remembered this happens every time our army kills innocent people while trying to get the bad guy.
I feel like so many people do not see it as a reality when it is very real and it is extremely devastating.
Hearing him talk about his stages of grief and goalof forgiveness was unreal; he was so open and honest about it.
For a man that losthis wife and daughter in a brutal, sudden way only a few years ago, he seems to be living the happiest life he is able.
I really had to step back and think if I were in his shoes how would I feel if my life were taken from me and because of the United States accident I get offered money for my family members who were killed.
it really shows me that live is too short to stay mad at something forever because at the end of the day time doesn't stop and neither should we.
We grow up in an environment where we are told to believe certain ideas that help shape our understanding of universal perspectives.
I also was interested to see where he would take the class with this role reversal after his introduction to the class and I also was disappointed.
I also did not like how the class was scripted, it felt as though Sam was simply attempting to shock the class with statistics rather than talk about a very sensitive topic.
The American point of view is that we are the most influential nation in the world and therefore the politics of other nations must revolve around our own.
The promises that many presidents make fail in the face of political battling and partisanship.
The United States has a tendency to entrench itself in places where it engages in Nation building.
I vividly remember this question during class and it really made me think about a numerous of different things.
I think one of the main reasons why he was able to forgive was because of his understanding of the American people.
Most of the time the people who judge and hate have never really had an interaction with a person from the other background.
Holding grudges for too long will do nothing but put you into a state of anger that you cant do anything about anymore.
Just another example of how the citizens of America are blinded to what is truly happening in the Middle East.
Bassim saying that nothing has changed between the presidencies is shocking because to me an American citizen I see a difference with each president that we have had.
It could also because I have noticed change in this country and havent been paying much attention to how other countries have been.
Political movements have become a thing that are beneficial to get into.
His views may have changed because mine certainly did.
If you arent 100 percent sure dont go through with it and wait to go through with it for another day or time.
You brought up a very interesting point about comparing the fear of a country thats constantly at war to Americas 9 11.
It is crazy to me that we mourn the loss of the innocent people in New York that day to this day, but those types of losses happen daily in Bossims country.
The devastation they must constantly feel is unimaginable.
He doesn't hate the American people with everything he has?
If we all walked a mile in Basim's shoes, I'm positive we would have a very different idea about the Iraqi people.
I really enjoyed getting to hear Basim's story, and I am grateful that Sam allowed us all to experience something as raw as this.
LinkThe video I chose to reflect on is Introducing Basim Razzo.
The day in class when we skyped Basim was the most interesting and inspirational class I have ever been to.
The worst part of the situation is that the United States government only him a couple thousand dollars as if that was a reasonable apology.
If there was a war going on in the United States and a foreign country accidentally bombed a random civilians house, it would be the top news story for weeks.
It is so hard to believe that his story did not even make the daily neighborhood newspaper.
You never know what is going to happen next in your life, everything in the world is so unpredictable.
When i start to think about it, I do completley agree with you.
The united states is more divided now than it ever has been and its not going to change anytime soon.
I do believe that the use of violence on someone becasue they are a different religion is terrible.
We all have a choice in our lives on what we believe in.
That's also why I agree with you on your statement of the georgia Laws.
Im sure he was wondering why he was bombed because he has nothing to do with this war.
When the answer to the question why was that it was just a mistake, the only reaction I would have would be anger.
He had everything taken away from him because the United States military made an error in where to drop the bomb that day.
What makes it even worse is that as retribution for his family being killed he was given a very small amount of money to repay him for his loss.
However Bassim decided to take another approach.
They never forced me to pick a religion, but would rather I make my own choice.
Watching this lecture gave me a thought-provoking question, do we really need religion?
As a child, I never really saw the purpose of religion, as it seemed to create more problems than solutions in the world.
However, when a small portion of the Christian population participate in the Charlottesville Rally, endorsing violence, racism, and antisemitism, President Trump does not advocate to ban Christians from the United States.
Maybe religion is a destructive pillar in society, but it also has many benefits.
There are so many great qualities in religion, making it a shame how so many people can use it for hateful purposes.
In the video, Bassims Advice To The Class, he asks us to be more aware of people and places outside of the United States, and that we should all try to forgive people, even when it seems impossible.
Bassim said that it is much easier to be aware of what is going on in the world thanks to the technology that we have today.
He also said that we should always try to forgive people.
I think it is important for us to all learn how to forgive even when forgiving seems impossible.
Personally, I think that this forgiveness also extends to ourselves.
I think that we all need to be able to forgive, but not forget as all experiences, even the ones that are not as positive, shape us to be who we are.
I too could not believe how calm and at ease Bassim was after what had happened to him in his life.
He was able to take such grief and turn it into positivity and keep on living his life without hate.
I cannot imagine what your parents went through either, but I think everyone has different experiences and react in a different way.
I look up to Bassim for his calmness and forgiveness, but dont know if I myself could react in such way.
I have no idea what theyve been through, but I hope they can be able to live a happy live without the hate eating away at them.
He has every reason to label and hate all Americans.
Americans took everything he loved away from him.
It's shocking to me - the fact that we are constantly hearing about tragedies like this that happen to people in our own country, but the media turns a blind eye to the own atrocities we cause others.
I think about how too often they are all generalized as terrorists because of the acts of a few extremists.
This discussion, as with most discussions in this class so far, have helped me see things from an entirely different perspective.
In this video Bassin addresses the student body and gives his final remarks about his life and experiences.
To think that there are women and men serving in the military without knowing the country they will be fighting a war with seems bizarre and makes me wonder if this is a strategy to makes it easier to fight with people they know nothing about.
I agree with Bassim when he comments that the media controls everyone in the United States.
I believe this will allow individuals to view the world and other cultures within the United States as something to be celebrated instead of feared or persecuted.
On another note after hearing what happened I was very saddened but after actually talking to him on skype a whole other perspective of this situation came about because it made it so real and powerful.
High schools and colleges are doing their best to make sure that students are aware of the world around them, but there is just too much constantly happening to teach that in a classroom.
Bassim brings up a great point that the technology today allows for immediate access to any information that you could want to learn.
Being able to hear first hand from people living in parts of the world that often slip our minds is an amazing opportunity that this class provides to its students.
I am very grateful that I have been able to see exactly what it is like for different people around the globe and it has opened my eyes beyond the stereotypes.
Bassims experiences in Iraq have showed me that the whole country is not at war and there are many people living their lives very normally there and that they are not in constant fear of what is going to happen next.
A primary way these groups of people take over people and dominate societies is by controlling and limiting forms of communication.
Regardless of how advanced a society is or its varying histories, a civilization can always be brought to its knees when its forms of communication are determined by a governing entity.
This is what ISIS was doing when they cut the internet and satellite TV.
Not having preset lectures just opens the door for so many topics to discuss in class.
Also, I like how he talks about Islam often.
Muslims have such a negative stereotype in the U.S because of events that have happened in our history.
But we cannot blame an entire religion of 1.8 billion people based on a handful of Muslims.
I found this interesting because his response to what ISIS forced upon Iraq is how most people in America think Muslims are.
An example of this is bearded Muslim men; very stereotypical, but Basim said that they were forced to grow beards and shave mustaches.
The reality is that they are just normal people, not everyone wants to live so religiously, just like in America.
His response was not what I wouldve expected, which just goes to show how much I do not understand his situation.
You can hear about the lives of someone across the world, but if you have not experienced what they have experienced, then you will never truly understand.
When Sam invited Basim to talk about his experience and the outcome of him living in Mosul, it really opened my eyes to the effects war can have on a city and its people.
Basim is an example of a man whose life was completely altered due to the effects of war and the destruction it caused in one's life.
Basim realizes this and that's why he goes into talking about how he believes that his life in Mosul is probably over.
He knows Mosul will never be able to bounce back from this because its how the world works nowadays.
The video clip that I chose to watch is the class discussion with Basim Razzo.
I believe that this class was one of the most eye opening and interesting classes of the semester so far.
I realized that one of the things that I love the most in my life is my family.
When he said that he never gave up because him surviving the attack meant to him that god had a larger plan for him, I was truly moved.
However, all Muslims are not to blame for the actions of a few.
If Basim was able to come to this realization then why cant all Americans, or the entire rest of the world, as well?
While to us each president looks and acts differently, with a different political party and policy, to these other countries, they might as well be the same, given that they're invading and bombing their homeland.
I feel as though sympathy has gone out of the window for many of us.
He lost everything so some help getting him new things would have gone a long way.
We treated him horribly so I see why people would dislike America.
The empathy isnt in the world anymore but it is specifically lacking within many Americans.
I feel that opinions many have of others are really hindering moving forward in becoming decent human beings to each other.
Instead, he continued to believe in our people because he can see the shades of gray in the world.
Another reason I believe that Basim was able to forgive, besides his faith, which he also discussed in class, is because I think he wanted to heal and was eventually tired of being angry.
Its human nature to survive, and Basim had to let go of his anger in order to move forward in life.
I am proud of Basim for staying true to himself, his family, his friends (including his American friends), and his religion after the horrific, devastating life event.
Prior to hearing him in class, I was a person who held a lot of grudges.
When tragedies happen, if you are upset and angry at all times, that anger and sadness will eat you up and give you nothing to live for.
For example, an event like Charlottesville is a perfect example of an event we can learn from instead of just being upset about the events.
I truly think that that was the most important thing Basim taught us.
I myself try not to hold grudges because in my mind I really see no point.
What happened already happened and there is really nothing you can do about it.
I myself am not a religious person but he looks through religion to guide him and make him happy and it is amazing how it really does work.
Anger does nothing for a person but make them do stupid things and not be themselves.
Bassim has every reason to not want to go on, but he still does.
He continues to do so even knowing that things will never be the same.
It was not the American people who chose to make the decision to bomb the people in Mosul, and I think Basim in telling us this was attempting to raise awareness, so we as a country can work to prevent our government from letting these events continue to happen.
Like you said, if we took the time to respect this, we might actually be able to see a change in the world.
If only Sam could enlighten the rest of our society and encourage people to step outside their comfort zone and look at life through a different perspective.
This is a point that keeps reoccurring in my response because it is very powerful and the truth is sorry.
People formulate their opinions based on the information that is given to them.
The media controls the opinion of the people by showing only videos or stores of what they want them to think.
The world outside of the United States bubble is nothing like what the media is telling the people.
Almost his whole family was killed in the bombings (except his son).
People in the United States have started to act like its a norm when people in other countries die to bombings, attacks, etc.
So much more is going on in the world and Americans seem to not know anything about it.
It was humbling to hear about the way ordinary civilians live in Iraq when the war surrounds them everyday.
If Iraqians came to America and patrolled the streets likewise to how American soldiers do in Iraq, I wouldnt know how to live.
Would I listen to what they said in my homeland?
Bassim explained how he moved to a different city in Iraq, but does he miss his hometown?
Or is it too hard for him to stay in the place where his family was killed?
How can he just forgive America for the actions we have done?
It makes me think, why does the U.S. government have to be so harsh and mess around with ordinary civilians in another country?
It makes me sick to my stomach and I feel so bad for all the lives that were taken because of it.
Sam put together this visual of his life and made him a real person to us which some people may not have seen him as because of his race and religion.
Sam gave us images of this wonderful life he had.
Then when he told us how Basims house was bombed along with his brothers house and showed us the pictures and messages he sent I was completely heartbroken.
Sam made me imagine how I would feel if that happened to me.
How would I feel if a different countrys government came in and accidentally bombed my house with my family?
My thoughts the entire time was about what happened to Basim?
Sam found out about what Basim went through because of Basims post on Facebook.
We did not put it in the news that we destroyed a family.
Does it happen so much that we dont think we should let the American people know what we are actually doing?
This was very interesting to me because, after hearing about what Bassim went through, I dont think I could feel the same way that he does.
Because of my feelings towards this, I admire Bassim greatly and am so thankful that he spoke to the class about his feelings towards what happened as well as why he is not angry with us.
Another thing that I found interesting about this portion of the class was how Bassim talked about how he came to forgive us through religion.
This also got me thinking about another lecture we had where Sam pointed out how most religious teachings are essentially the same and how this applied to what Bassim was saying.
I would be so upset I would have to go into solitude or just be numb, as Basim said he was in the months following the murders of his family members.
It can sometimes be very hard to relate to some of the social injustices for minority ethnicities because, as a white male, I have not experienced what a person of a minority ethnic race has experience.
However, that goes the same for myself, it is unfair of someone to judge me based off of my ethnicity as well.
Its just unfair to assume one could do so.
Now, you may be able to gain a very basic sense of where that person is coming from, but it wont feel the same to you as it does to them.
That is part of the reason I find religion so fascinating, it is easy enough to understand the philosophy behind every religion if you put the time and effort into understanding it.
In today's society, people are used to hearing about bad events taking place all around the world via television or internet.
I was in complete shock when Sam opened Skype and Bassim was there staring back at the class.
Bassim spoke about a lot of striking topics such as Mosul today, his family, his job, etc, but the thing that stuck with me the most is the attached video clip above.
Because of an accidental bombing, Bassim lost several close family members, but does not carry hatred or anger in his heart toward America.
Also, Bassim is mature enough to acknowledge the fact that not all American's act the same way as our government.
He mentions that he lived in the United States for eight years and has a variety of American friends, some of which allowed Bassim to live with them and go on vacations together.
He also proves the stereotype that people who live in the Middle East are all violent and blood thirsty wrong.
I feel like too many people hold grudges and it only detracts from their social life.
To start, I think that the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 should be something that is discussed every year to remember all the people that lost their lives on that day in New York.
There were so many thoughts going through my head not even during class, but the next day as we talked about what happened in our lab groups.
I was raised a Catholic, and went to Catholic school my whole life.
Being raised a Catholic, I was also taught to forgive and to turn the other cheek when hit, but I was really shocked when he explained that he did not hate American people.
I also agree with your opinion that the September 11 terrorist attacks attacked as a great driving force that gave the American government even more reasoning to invade Iraq.
I find it awful though that the government tried to say that it was the sole purpose for invading Iraq, when clearly oil was a big part of that decision as well.
I also agree with your sports team analogy, it feels as though all of these other nations are rooting against us when in reality this is just untrue and based on the radical groups from these nations.
I couldnt agree more with you that being able to really speak with Basim live through skype was something very memorable.
Like the most of us, I also struggled trying to relate to the tragedy that this poor man has had to go through and you put it perfectly by saying that Basims response and attitude were incredibly respectable and honorable.
To see a man who has basically lost everything and still be able to live a happy life without any grudges is a miracle to see.
There was no one better who could have taught me that lesson then Basim himself who overcame the hardest obstacles I can possibly imagine.
We can use the information that Bassim has given to us in our everyday lives by challenging the rhetoric used within the politics driven by hate and bigotry to make the world a more equal place for all.
Bassim has gone through an immense amount of tragedy in his life.
Bassim's wife, daughter, brother and nephew were killed when American's bombed his house, as well as his brothers.
Bassim is just a regular man who was forever affected by an accident.
Thankfully, I have never experienced any kind of tragedy even remotely close to what Bassim has faced and I can't even imagine how difficult this is.
He does this in hope that we might help others who have experienced loss and to have people be more aware that there are great people like him in Iraq.
For his son he has to keep his drive.
If Bassim could keep going with this pain he carries, then I could overcome my worries.
I don't always go to church on Sunday, but I consider myself a good Catholic.
I find this class fascinating because we are able to talk to people from across the world about issues outside of the United States.
Sometimes are issues are so different and sometimes we might be surprised to find we have many things in common.
I even remember the class going dead silent when his face came on the screen as Sam introduced him.
I was completely blown away when he said that he forgave us for what had happened to him.
I just can't imagine being able to move past that event, when almost everything you know and love is stolen from you by a miscalculation.
And it really puts it into perspective to hear just what the war in the Middle East has done to some people.
He said that he was talking to a woman he had met before back in the States and that he has a new family member.
He said that policy hasn't really changed since each person has been president.
This is something that really resonated with me.
This is why this lecture was so eye opening for me.
I am so glad that I took it because it is different and amazing.
I also love the activities that we do during class.
Sam really makes you want to go to class and there are not many teachers you can say that about.
However, I didnt really find surprising that he said Iraq will never be the same after Isis.
I think at this point as well, ISIS completely changed the country and did so much damage.
Its amazing how he attributes this to his religion which is Islam, a religion that we Americans tend to attribute with violence and terrorism.
It completely changed my whole view on what it meant to be Muslim.
Basim is truly an example of what letting your religion guide you in life should be like, and hes truly someone who opened my eyes and completely flipped the script for me in terms of how I viewed being Muslim.
I think it takes a lot of courage to become so forgiving.
The fact that Basim even has such a good relationship with Sam who is an American.
This gave us all a huge reality check to be thankful for the things that we have and the country that we live in.
It really made me recognize how small my problems are compared to some people.
I think if people simply looked at other people with fresh eyes like you said we would live in a very different world.
I think that one of the most difficult things to do, is to see things fully from another perspective.
The one example I can always think of is hurricanes.
There is no possible way that we could relate to what happened to these people.
The thing that is important is you have to at least try.
The problem that is occurring here and all over the world is that people simply do not try to see things from other perspectives.
Taking steps is the process that needs to be done.
He subscribes to the school of thought that one shouldn't hold an entire nation responsible for what was done to him by their military.
He even says that the Americans that he met here took him into their home, became his friends and went on vacations with him.
That kind of pain usually leads to a dark rage that takes up a person's entire being and negatively affects their spiritual, mental and physical health.
Losing the most important things to you in life takes a huge toll on your emotions.
To be able to bounce back from such a terrible situation like that takes so much strength and willpower.
From my perspective, I would have thought Basim would try to get as far away as possible, but after hearing him speak I now realize how difficult that would be to do.
But his answer made a whole lot of sense, it was hurting me more than it was benefiting me.
He still finds peace with what he has left, him not dying in the bomb attack was a blessing of its own.
We need to start seeing life this way.
Bassim was completely right when he said that.
Yes, what happened to him was horrific and I can never imagine what he has went through but staying overly angry for the rest of his life and having so much hatred would just destroy him.
He needs to go on with life so he can get justice for his family with the American government.
I found his answer to be so profound on so many levels.
It reinforced my belief on forgiving others for yourself and not for them because staying hateful and angry only hurts yourself in the end.
I thought it was interesting that you said it shocked you when Basim's house and city were shown.
This is a common misconception that most people have about other countries mainly because of what they are exposed to from the media and just general ignorance.
Just like Basim said we need to not be so consumed with ourselves that we don't have compassion or care for those in other countries.
Reading up on what's going on around the world can clear up these misconceptions.
I'm glad that you have put some thought into how the media can portray places that suit the way they want Americans to see it.
I hear a lot of people generalize the idea that all muslims are violent, which leads to so many other false stereotypes.
Confusion and ignorance usually leads to generalizations and that is the last thing we want to do in order to understand what is preached in this class.
He also said Everything has changed.
What will this lifetime of chains do the younger generations?
It is so inspiring to know that he can forgive America.
But is makes me impossibly sad to know that in America, people who did not lose anything personally in 9 11 use their religion and religious differences to hate others.
I feel so lucky to be in this class because I get to experience people like Bassim who push my way of thinking.
I hope everyone takes the time to get to know people from all over the world who study here at Penn State.
Miranda, I completely agree with you in that we should not follow the Bible or the Quran word for word just because they are very old and times have changed a lot.
I cant understand why people still claim to say that they follow these books word for word but end up picking and choosing what they want to agree and disagree with.
For example, some people in the Christian or Muslim community still do not support gay marriage due to the fact that as stated in the Bible and Quran, it is a sin to be gay.
It makes me sad how sometimes horrible things happen and there is no relief or sense of closure for the people it happens to just because it deals with a section of government that we arent supposed to talk about.
How can people not imagine their own families when seeing these awful things done to other people.
Basim was such a delight to have as a guest in this class and I really appreciated hearing everything he had to say.
I think it takes a very very strong person to tell that story to a group of complete strangers, but he had no problems which I think really speaks to his character.
Basim, to have dealt with such a tragedy, is such a beautiful soul and truly was the light of the room during this class.
After this class I made all of my friends go back and watch these clips so they could understand why I walked home sobbing that day, but also so they could see what a truly amazing person looked like.
It is important for us to learn about the experiences innocent citizens in the middle east are having during the war, but it is not often shown in the media.
I know that I personally take for granted how safe the United States is while we are fighting a war.
They are strong for trying live a normal life despite that life taking place in the middle of a war zone.
First of all, this video was particularly interesting to me because I was wondering the same question myself.
How could that even be possible after what he described?
This also gained my attention because that is just like what the Bible says its followers are to do if they are true believers.
Although Basim does not say it in the video, I remember him saying that same line in class during the interview.
He started praying five times a day now and takes his studies more seriously now because his god did not let him die.
Im reacting to Will Iraq Ever Be the Same After ISIS video from SOC119 and it is really heartbreaking hearing someone who lived through Isiss takeover of Iraq say he has no hope in the foreseeable future for his country.
I never paid attention to what was going on over there in the middle east, all I knew is that there were bad people there with malicious intent.
It paints a picture of what we never are informed about.
We only hear about war when it comes to Iraq and its insane how we look over the people living there in the real struggle.
I sympathize with them because I put myself in their position.
Theyd probably restrict internet access which is extremely important to remain informed with world events today.
I feel really bad about not learning about this beforehand because I think its very important.
I mean I feel like whatever happens over there does have an impact on us over here in some manner.
I have the upmost respect for those forced to go under Isis rule, they do so to survive and to keep their families safe.
It is crazy to think about what would have been avoided if oil did not exist in Iraq.
Obviously when Sam told the class of Basims story I was in utter shock.
When Sam showed the message that Basim sent him shortly after his family was killed and his house was destroyed, my stomach dropped.
Something that I thought was crazy is how he moved past what happened to his family.
Also, it was also crazy how Sam brought up that the bombing was never important enough to make any newspapers, but for Basim and Sam it was a huge deal.
I think we as Americans forget to think about the innocent people of places that have been affected by our military and the destruction of war.
He actually had it in his heart to forgive the country that just uprooted his entire life, which takes so much to overcome.
We have to all appreciate the fact that Basim opened up to us because it showed us how war really can hit home for people and it's not just a thing to think about, because it's very real in effecting respectable people's lives.
How could a person not be completely consumed by hatred when they have nothing left.
Basim was stripped of everything he had in life due to an accident.
When asked by a student how are you not angry, Bassam gave a simple answer: anger was hurting me more than it was helping me.
The word Islam actually means peace, so its disheartening to hear Americans discriminate the entire religion just because of a few unfortunate events.
It is so easy for a person to construct their own views on an entire religion based on a few interactions.
Our nation could be on a much more progressive path, but leaders such as Trump are prolonging this stagnation.
I thought his connections to Americans was very important for his healing process after the events.
He thought about real people from the country that killed his family and realized no, it is not the peoples fault, it is the government.
I think it is important to know that the events that caused Basims tragedies are nothing new to the world.
That had really changed the idea about Islam in some states too.
I come from a Hindu family, my mother who is a Hindu as well she has a wrong opinion on the Muslims.
But after the conservative party (BJP) came to rule, there has been a lot of violence from the many Hindu groups in India.
It somewhat makes me feel as a hypocrite.
When a few group of people who claim to follow Muslim and cause destruction is labelled a terrorist but at the same time when someone who follows your religion cause destruction they are judged by the same eyes.
It was really important that Sam designed this class to show what it would be like if black people became the leaders in American society because it really shines light on the fact that white people have long abused their influential roles in this country.
This activity proved that African American people in this country have never been able to achieve equality in this country because this system in the United States has been devised only to suit the needs of white Americans.
I feel that we, in America, have progressed a lot since the times of slavery and Jim Crow Laws, but we certainly have not fully addressed the injustice against minorities that still exists in this country.
When we see events like this it really does make me question the thought process behind our government.
I also like the point you brought up about the power of forgiveness, now although he was able to forgive and move on what I think disturbs me most is that they offered him next to no compensation for the loss of his family.
Not that money will bring his family back or fix what happened but to me if I was Bassim I would have been offended.
Hi Rachel, I agree with Bassim's remarks on how the American citizens absorb too much information from the media without digesting it.
People tend to live in their own world where what they know is good, and what they are unsure of is thought of for them and deemed to be bad by the media.
I think that racism is a result of looking for the wrong side in a story, many believe the struggle in the middle east is over freedom and establishing democracy, but really we are stripping these people of both and leaving them in a state of misery and destitution.
I think that it is very hard to imagine actually living in a war zone for most Americans because we have never experienced it.
This lecture made me think how this war affects the good people who live in these areas, not just the radical hate groups who make up a very small percentage of the population.
At some points it felt really forced and kind of like awkwardly scripted to get points across but again that may have just been intentional to avoid awkwardness.
Overall though, I felt like it was a pretty insightful class.
I know that is only one aspect of getting jailed but it shows once again how corrupt our society is.
Something that he did as his religion tells him to do.
Forgiving is something really hard to do, and even more when your life may be completely broken due to other people,just like it happened to Basim.
The most possible think to happen to Basim if he didn'tforgive, is that he would have probably gone mad and crazy because of all the hate inside.
I think the advice Basim left to the class was very important, and is hopefully something we as Americans can work towards.
I would agree that many people get caught up in the news occurring in their own country, so much so that they become almost oblivious to the events occurring half way around the world because they are so far removed from them.
I also agree that the media is partially to blame, while the job of the media is to get the truth out; that isnt what always happens.
My political updates consist of seeing people tweet at Trump and getting CNN notifications when Trump tweets something dumb.
So when we began this class I actually had no clue what Sharia was.
I'm a Christian, so when Sam said that class was going to be about Christian Sharia my ears perked up.
Its interesting though because The Crusades were pretty much the Christian version of imposing terror on people that didn't agree with certain views.
It's important to know that when Americans say things like Muslims are terrorists it is such an inaccurate thought that its laughable.
A terrorist is not truly someone who is practicing Islam just like a KKK member is not a true Christian.
Like I said, I know from previous knowledge that not all Muslims are terrorists.
The fact that he went through something so terrible and was still able to realize that being so angry would harm him more than benefit him shocks me.
Another thing I found interesting about his situation is that hes planning on returning to Mosul soon.
I was actually shocked by this just because Ive never heard of someone wanting to go back to the place where their life was practically taken from them.
I feel like this shows in a sense how he isnt letting that horrible event completely define him life.
I think that it is really important for all people to be empathetic, however this can be tricky sometimes.
I liked how you said that in order to be empathetic, we need to step out of our comfort zones and embrace what it is like in someone else's shoes.
I think that we all need to constantly remind ourselves to be open-minded and see the world in as many different perspectives as we can.
he remarked that hopefully within 20 to 30 years their will be hope for that generation, but he has no hope for the foreseeable future.
This perspective on Afghanistan was very surprising to me because every video I see of Afghans they are always very optimistic and hopeful for their futures.
Although, it is understandable for him to be pessimistic when his country has been at war for decades.
It also shook me when he talked about having to change his entire lifestyle when ISIS came in.
However, I know that that is not what always happens.
I also thought for the longest time that all the people from those countries are militant and radical.
It truly warms my heart to see how he could forgive even though he has lost so much in such an unjust way.
He forgives but knows that it is a select group responsible and not all of the United States.
He is truly a role model and someone to look up to in the sense of true enlightenment.
While they may be followers of a specific religion they should not be indicative of that religion.
In this clip I feel like Sam did a very good job highlighting the fact that the Bible and the Quran can be perceived in many different ways and taken to many extremes based on who is interpreting them.
In their minds, their view is the only truth, and those they are directing their hate to are the horrible and twisted people that we see them as.
I feel like this disconnect comes from a lack of awareness of the fact that our perspective of anything is never the only one, and is far from any absolute truth.
In the case of the bible and the clip from class, some people may wonder why it is that others may interpret a passage in a way that completely contradicts their own interpretation of it.
They both place their faith in the same book, yet interpret it completely differently because of their life experiences and the culture they grew up in.
The bible is just one way to exemplify this concept, but it can be applied to anything.
The whole situation in thiscountry, and so many other countries that we do not know enough about.
This also definitely makes me feel lucky as well.
I also think that wars should not be fought at all.
Sam had told us before the discussion started that this particular class would be concerning empathy, but I was not prepared to face the extent in which empathy would be shown to us that day.
We viewed many pictures of Bassim along with his wife, his children, we saw his brother, his nephew, we even saw images of their homes.
They loved one another and it was very obvious to see that through the photos and the words Sam had said about Bassim and his family.
Both of their homes were destroyed as we saw in the images, their beautiful homes were now piles of rubble.
I was beyond upset, horrified, guilty and felt many other emotions while thinking to myself that my own government had ruined the lives of these innocent individuals.
I know that if I were him, what happened would be unforgivable in my eyes.
Bassim had said that he does not hate us and he is not angry because he knows that our government's goal was only to protect the citizens and not to hurt him.
Although it can be diminishing, it is also very intriguing and makes me actually want to learn about it and listen to people from different parts of the world, like Bassim, so that I can gain that kind of knowledge.
You hear stories about war and feel bad for the victims, but then you just kind of move on with your life.
When Basim appeared on the screen, I immediately shed a tear.
Everyone he cared about was gone in an instant and here he was casually talking to a class of American students.
If a foreign government came to my land in search of my resources and my life was destroyed, I would hate them.
The first time I was introduced to a different perspective on war was in one of my comparative literature classes at Penn State.
It was a human rights violations class and my professor focused on the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Basims answer was the most amazing response to this question that I could have imagined.
He explained that at first, he was numb to what had occurred, then he stated that he became so angry for a long time.
After that, he explains that the anger was so intense that it was eating him.
At this point I had to stop and take a step back to try to imagine what this must have been like.
Personally, I did not really have much of an idea what the everyday Afghani man was like, but wow did they give me a good opening impression with this incredible man Bassim.
Hopefully, hearing what Basim had to say will have an impact an all who listened and will make them realize things from the other side.
Hes saying there is no point in holding grudges or staying angry with people because it does nothing positive for you.
Another thing I found interesting from Basims response was he reasoning behind why he is not angry at America.
Basim went to college here and would have stayed here permanent if not for his father making him promise to return back to Mosul.
I thought if he did not experience American culture and people first hand would he have been able to have the same feelings to use.
And this opened my eyes because I was able to see why some of the people from these areas feel the way about America as they do.
I think its very easy to have a warped perception of us when all you see was a negative.
Can a person really be oppressed if they don't feel oppressed.
And who am I as a third party to say if someone is oppressed when they deny that they are oppressed.
Instead, the hijab is part of the muslim religion and so the women that wear the hijab do not see it as sexist.
However I do believe that the true identity of the hijab lies with the people who wear them.
I do not believe that there are right and wrong answers to this discussion but truth of the matter ultimately rest with the women who wear them.
In 14 years, we have had three different presidents and still have seen that nothing has really changed.
Between the Americans and Iraqi people, there seems to be the same problems that existed before.
Every presidential administration has promised that it would do something to fix the corruption that is taking place in this country; instead, Basim is telling us that nothing is being done to improve the tension taking place in Iraq whatsoever.
I feel that our presidents must do more when it comes to Iraq.
The standard of living there is very different compared to that here in the United States.
I feel that the President should have more responsibility in fixing tensions that may occur between his her country and other.
It looks bad that we have had issues with Iraq and Iraqis feel hopeless to an extent because they want change in some way to fix problems.
This is something that I was recently shocked to discover as well.
It was not until the Russians came during the Cold War that the country had been devastated and the society was ruined and the population displaced.
It is very disheartening to see such things happen across the world in different places as well.
There has been an increased fear in America since the 9 11 attack.
People hating muslins because of something someone with the same faith did is pure ignorance.
The fact that Basim forgives us shows what kind of person he and many others are.
This is a very hard hitting question and the answer Basim gave was extremely beautiful.
He knows that those that went through with the bombing were not average American citizens.
If I were Basim I am not sure I could forgive that easily but I hope my heart would open to see the bigger picture.
Calling Muslims violent oppressive people who infringe on their beliefs.
Him speaking makes it real we hear about bombings in the middle east all the time on the news but never the repercussions it has on the normal people who live there.
War is never a good thing and I thought it was cool how Sam presented one of the main reasons we entered Iraq to begin with, oil.
Many in our country don't realize how many innocent civilians lost their lives because of this senseless war.
Just imagine if you were sleeping at night and another countries military accidentally bombed your house killing much of your family and losing pretty much everything you have?
Even through all these horrors of war it seems war is glorified in the United States.
As for Basim, I also found it truly interesting how all the media wants you to think of when you think of Islam is sharia law, violence, and terrorism, and yet its actually what helped Basim forgive and dispel his anger.
The learning process may take longer than it should, but I have been able to move past that hatred for the Muslim religion as a whole and see it for what it is.
I agree with a lot of what you said Jessica.
I feel like you did a better job of saying some of the things I wanted to saying my own post.
I completely agree with what you had to say and I have so much admiration for Bassim because of the level of maturity, positivity, and empathy he is able to enlighten us with.
Additionally, I agree that it is so crucial to educate oneself and to learn research more that is given from one single article, tweet, or any social media post.
I do not have to worry about being killed for not following a stupid rule put in place by people that i did not vote for.
I also can not imagine having my family stolen and decimated the way his was.
They have been extraordinarily influential in my shaping of my personality.
This gave a real perspective as to the many different ways things can be interpreted.
Similar to Islam, the Bible has a bunch of rules that are left to be interpreted by whoever reads it.
This says a lot about the way people can interpret religious readings because we then started talking about how radical ideas can come to be.
For example, ISIS and the Taliban are terroristic groups that make Muslims have the stereotype of being dangerous, especially in American culture.
However, citizens in other countries might view all US presidents the same because, even if US presidents claim they will change their foreign policy from the previous president, citizens in other countries barely experience the difference.
Unfortunately, Basim provided numerous examples of ways in which US intervention in Iraq has compounded the several problems already in the area.
It's crazy to see how the bible can be interpreted by different types of people.
I am raised in a Catholic church but I have not really sat down and interpreted the bible.
Some people take the bible veryseriously and some just read the passages during church.
Some people use the bible as a guide through life and only follow the what the bible says.
I too, am not really that religious, although I was raised Catholic.
Religion does seem like a means of hope for some, but when others use it as a crutch to back up certain beliefs just because the Bible says so, then it seems like it is doing more hurting than helping.
People like Rafi and his children have to go thru it, his children do not know another world other than the one they see in Afghanistan.
Many soldiers from the US army have been killed in combat for fighting in a war that most people do not even know why we are fighting in.
Whenever I thought about Afghanistan I thought of the desert and not many people living there other than terrorists.
After these lectures, I realized that there is people on both sides, soldiers going into a country that they have no business being in, and civilians of Afghanistan that have to continue to deal with bombings and their own civilians being killed.
First and foremost, I thought it was intriguing to Skype with a Mosul citizen who had a firsthand experience with the American government.
Unfortunately, these mistakes can negatively alter the lives of those who are innocent or undeserving.
Stories such as these are one's that don't typically make the news, which is why many individuals are unaware of these types of incidents.
Living in a growing era of technology, I am hopeful that a more precise system to detect our enemies will be created, and can prevent reduce the number of those who are unintentionally sought out.
I put myself in his shoes for a minute, and tried to imagine what life would be like if a group of people randomly came in and changed my whole way of life one day.
If all of our bridges were bombed, it would simply be impossible to get anywhere.
There would be a massive loss of income due to the amount of people unable to get to work, which is one huge problem on it's own.
Stating that a this class is a class on empathy and not just learning about race and sociology.
It broads the horizons of how people think of other races and connects different races showing that we truly are not that different except for the color of our skins.
Lucas, I completely agree with your point because I too always had a general view on war, but never seen the affects and aftermath of such.
Having a real life person tell you about he personally was affected by the war really puts it into perspective.
Forgiveness is a hard thing to do but is so liberating once it is done.
We are in control of our happiness and how we react to difficult situations really shows us who we are.
I think you got to put in his feet and think forward in your life.
Even though his country is a country of war, it would make sense that he would want to be in his homeland just like the citizens who live there continue to live there throughout the war.
(Id also like to add that the girl with her jaw dropped around 9:45 in the video is exactly how I reacted to the tear jerking story of Basim and his family.)
I was completely stunned and speechless in what he had told the room.
How in the world can you put a price on someone's life?
It won't fix any damage done to his life other than materialistic and physical things.
It got me thinking about war and if it is necessary.
When I thought about it, this kind of stuff happens all the time around the world.
It's a sad thought, but it's a fact.
Basim's response to the bombings of forgiving the United States is a true testament to the man that he is.
I dont think many of us in that lecture could say we could forgive and move forward the way he has.
They are normal people with families who work, go to school and want to live a peaceful life just like us.
He coped with his loss in a very respectable manner, and I understand why he was so numb in the beginning of the process.
You were dead on when you said it was amazing how he dealt with the situation.
I appreciate Bassim and the lessons he taught our Soc 119 class.
In a world surrounded by technology, people often disregard the thoughts and feelings of one another, and lack empathy towards others.
This is something that was passed down from our parents and grandparents, but has been more inflated due to our access to technology and different information surrounding it.
However, peoples eyes need to open up to the other side of things like that, so we can have empathy towards people like Basam.
This was surprising to me only because I honestly never knew how they felt.
Overall though, this was definitely one of my favorite activities performed in class.
I also am in disbelief on Bassims ability to be so forgiving to people from the country that caused a very dark time in his life.
He seems to be very open minded because of his religion.
He has inspired me to keep my eyes open to more things that are going on around me and to not let previous negative events cloud my judgement on something.
It was great that he is trying to teach his way of viewing life to the students here.
One thing that I noticed was that Isis is terrible but only an outlier to what the people are were really like there.
After listening to the man speak as well as the pictures that I've seem, Mosul will never be the same.
Those are the places that they patrol at least.
I don't think that higher officials of our government understand the responsibility that they need to uphold and the impact that they have on the future.
Listening to the man speak made it sound like living in Mosul was like being caught between a rock and a hard place.
I agree with absolutely everything that you had said in your post, as I too chose this particular discussion to write my post about.
Many Americans live their lives not knowing the disasters that are occurring every single day in other parts of the world and being simply unaware that their own government could quite possibly be destroying the lives of others.
As this country is learning to grow upon by hatred, you are extremely correct by saying that what we need right now is to forgive.
Also, I find it ironic that modern-day Asians get much better treatment here in the United States than the Native Americans do!
According to Sams map, Asians (who eventually evolved into their Native American group) were in North America far longer than any European.
A group who is native to this country should be respected, not just pushed over to the side like they dont matter.
If their drillings caused a predominately white town to be uprooted, there would be tons of backlashes in the media.
I thought it was awesome that we were able to actually speak to Basim Razzo and physically see him on the screen as he was answering the class' questions.
I don't know how someone would not be full of anger when they lost basically everything.
I think its amazing that so many of us could come to this conclusion from hearing the man talk one time.
I think that it says a lot about the way Basim views humanity.
I also thought that it was interesting that he was able to completely recognize his stages of grief.
I felt like this gave a insight by connecting it to an issue that I did not expect.
They had this will imposed on them, while our country is the one imposing our will on Syria.
Also we are different from North Korea as they are a dictatorship, while we have the right to elect our leaders.
The citizens of North Korea are not responsible for their leaders actions as they have no real possibility to change their leaders, while we do.
I can not imagine having been in his position because I feel like I would be so bitter after having my life nearly destroyed by another country that is not even my own.
I could tell that Basim had given this a lot of thought over the years of dealing with these tragedies because of how genuine he was during class.
Basim truly opened my eyes to the harsh reality of what is going on across the world.
Often times I do not recognize this because I am so sheltered in America.
I can not help but feel sympathy for those who live in places plagued with war and hatred.
It is not often that I get to learn about different cultures especially from someone who has been through so much.
Often times viewers will have to question whether they can trust the sources and many will just not take the time at all.
The best thing to do would be to read pieces from each different perspective and truly try to understand a topic but instead were given a news market of people either totally uninformed or woefully misinformed.
Up until that lecture my access to the Iraqi population perspective was virtually zero, this is true for issues across both social and international borders.
Many innocent people died in ways that are impossible to comprehend.
This day was the day that America decided to go to war.
America by accident bombed his house and killed his wife and daughter.
They also bombed his brothers house and killed his son who was Basims nephew.
Its truly sad to see these people face to face and just be able to tell that their entire life has revolved around the war and always living in fear.
I couldnt imagine trying to live a life like that.
Its the government, not me, and people need to understand that, that there is more to a country than its government, especially when deciding to form an opinion on that countries people.
It is obviously a lot easier said than done especially when dealing with a tragedy of this magnitude.
His character is strong I say this, but if the same type of thing were to happen to me and my family I really don't know if I could ever forgive.
You can't put a price on human life there is no amount of money that could ever make this all better.
I was also shocked at the fact that Basam could forgive the people that had done this to his home and family.
The fact that he is so connected to his faith after an accident like this should be applauded.
When it comes to the closeness of Muslim religion and Christianity, it shows that Muslim religion has a more empathetic side to their beliefs.
Christians often preach their beliefs to be better than others, and dont accept the beliefs of some.
To go through such a tragedy and still come out on the other side with such grace and a positive outlook on life is honestly so inspiring, and although nobody should ever have to go through something like that he really made the most out of the situation and seems like a happier person now because of it.
Something that I found really sad is that we never saw his story on the news here in America.
Should we not be aware of these things when they happen?
I'm very happy he's suing the U.S. government because after going through what he did, he deserves way more than that.
It is easy for individuals to become blinded by their anger, which causes a great level of ignorance.
It makes me think, if 9 11 never occurred, would people still behave in this manner?
If Bassim did not generalize our people after what was done to him, we should not generalize his people.
Speaking for myself, I am a see the glass as half full kind of person, but I also understand that positive is not the only possibility in the world.
I think its amazing that he realized that being angry at America won't help him at all and if anything it could make him feel worse about it.
He decided that its best if he forgives because he knows that there is nothing he can do about it now and that he shouldn't spend the rest of his life being angry.
One cannot have empathy without a degree of sympathy; they are two different things.
In a second, almost everything you have in the world is gone.
Maybe even your pets.The idea that your entire life can be torn away in a second is a terrifying one and most of the Iraqi people lived it almost everyday of their lives.
This is why I find it so incredible that Bassim had everything taken from him, only to turn around and say he does not feel anger towards the American people.
The generalizations people make against certain groups of people are hateful and are learned from media and their peers or family.
It is a shame to consistently see Muslims from all over the world because of their religion meanwhile Christians have been doing worse all across the world also.
When Sam described the reasons we invaded Iraq, it helped clear up a lot of the confusion I had on the topic.
It was also interesting when Sam brought up his Ted Talk video about the U.S. invasion.
So how a person goes about handling tragedies like this and their responses, to me, all depends on their upbringing.
Our society is constantly focused on equality and giving everybody equal opportunities.
Those are ideals that we preach as a nation.
But when it comes down to it, how free and equal are we really.
This story just demoralizes me because I have never even considered something like that happening to me.
This is one of the most horrific stories I have ever heard and it's crazy to think that everyone who lived in Mosul has to fear about their lives every second of the day.
Bassim has really inspired me to become a more forgiving person and he made me realize that the problems in our life in the US are so miniscule to what he has endured.
Although emotional and tough to hear, it was important and I think he left a lasting impression on many students.
I think many of us want to deny the censorship the United States has over the media stream.
I also agree this was excellent advice to college students.
Listening to Basims story genuinely broke my heart and during this class I cried tears of sadness and repentsadness because of his unimaginable pain and repent for what my country had done to his family and their carless efforts of repayment for his familys deaths.
If something like this had happened to me, I would not only hate, but never trust any American ever again.
I wish to be as strong as this man one day because Lord knows I would have been on a rampage if anything like this were to happen to me.
The craziest thing is that they get no recognition for what they do.
I want them to know they are appreciated and what they do has a huge impact, especially on people like my classmates and I.
This is something I can see happening in anyones life.
You can not solve a problem with anger, but if you channel that anger into something more useful thats how you can feel better.
However, he does mention that he lived in America and all he saw was the good in people.
He also states that he has lived in America for 8 years and that every individual he has met has been kind and caring and therefore he cannot be angry at all Americans.
This line really hit me hard when I was listening to Bassim speak.
Bassim had gone through, in my mind, the worst possible tragedy a parent could encounter.
I continuously question the leadership of America, something that I had never done seriously before.
This post is about the character and morals of the man that was elected to lead or country.
Trump is living in his own world and as long as he is, we will never be the same great nation that once created great changes throughout the world.
When listening to Sam talk about all of the Christians who have done horrible things, it really throws me back.
The story about a Christian boy killing black people in a church makes me realize that there are some people who interpret the bible so differently.
For the longest time, I thought that people that lived through the Christian faith had the same mindset that I do.
I used to have something against Islam because I have heard of these heart wrenching stories, but I will no longer think this way.
I am guilty of this type of thinking as well, but this class helped to change it.
I respect everything he said in the video and I totally understand what he has to go through as a person who loses a house to a catastrophic disaster.
The fact that he is able to stay strong and live life again is just impressive.
The unexpected flood occurred at a very rapid rate that my friends were unable to prepare before hand.
In this case is the similarity between my friends and Basim that, although they were casualties in their situation; they were still able to forgive and not get stuck on their loss.
Furthermore, I truly respect Basim in the fact that even though he has American friends, he had no intention to put the mistakes of American Army on them.
The fact that he is able to put the hate aside and use forgivenessas a motivation to continue living his life is impressive.
I thought his response to this question was extremely powerful.
Basim lost absolutely everything when his house was bombed accidentally by Americans.
However, Basims response shows how to take the high road and realize that one persons actions cannot change your view on an entire population of people.
One American who took everything away from him does NOT represent America as a whole.
Many Americans view Muslims in a negative light due to events like 9 11 that were clear terrorist attacks on our country.
I found it interesting when he said that no matter who the president, the effects of war have always been the same and that he is angry at the U.S. government, not the citizens themselves.
His city is rubble but his love for his family makes him want to go back home, this made my heart warm and restored my faith in humanity.
As Sam soon stated Basim was an average guy from Afghan with a normal life.
Sams personal history with Basim made the story even more emotional to listen to.
After this week, I have continued to reflect on the interactions we had with Bosim.
No matter the religion a person practices, no person should have to under go what happened to Bosim.
This tragedy clearly made him a stronger person, which allowed him to take his knowledge further into the lives of others.
However, I do not believe that I am the only person in the world who makes this assumption.
He was able to make such a name for himself in the Afghani world and to have his whole life destroyed from the accidental bombing of Americans is something so tragic and hard to listen to.
If this were an American family being accidentally bombed by the Afghani people, it would be all over the news.
I could not imagine having gone through what Bassim has been through.
I agree with you about the fact that Muslims are not portrayed well in society.
The one thing I found cool and funny were the slides.
This made me think... what would it be like if it were normal to hear news like this?
I think we would see many more Americans opposing war or even just advocating for change if hearing stories about the atrocities we commit were more normal.
This idea is very empowering to think about because people all around the world judge others without even giving them a chance.
This class, Sociology 119, is teaching Penn State students to be aware of their surroundings and to be more accepting of everyone.
These stigmas that people hold about others is shaping the world into a place that is not accepting of most people and tends to create a hostile environment in many situations.
I know for myself that this class has already changed the way I think about so many things.
In my life I try to be accepting of all people but after taking this class I am even more aware of how I look at others.
This lesson on empathy and the rest of the lessons taught in this class are things that are hard to teach but are so important to know about.
In my response, I talked about how the radicalization of these religious readings can be interpreted in different ways and can lead to the formation of some of the group you mentioned in your response.
This goes back to the idea you mentioned about being fair and try to gain full knowledge of what is really going on without making rash assumptions.
I obviously cant speak for everyone in every situation, but typically members of your own group will always be more important than members of someone else's.
Even within the United States, subjects like living wages, quality public school systems, healthcare, and more are considered controversial and difficult topics.
It gets even more saddening when we take it outside of the US.
We have to also be empathetic toward those who are not a part of the us.
During the bombing, multiple members of Bassims family were murdered including his wife.
Bassim has gone through more tragedy in his life than anyone I have ever met and somehow he is able to give off such positive energy.
When asked by a student how he has the internal fornitude to be able to due this, he responded in basically saying that he doesnt really have a choice.
I cant imagine what Id do if I were in his position as I would most definitely not be able to handle it the way he is able to.
It is truly an eye opening story that unfortunately shows how cruel this world can be.
This group can be compared to groups like ISIS who also use the Quran to justify their practices of hate on a much more extreme scale.
When Sam was introducing this story he said something that caught my attention.
He said, what if some foreign military came into the United States and infiltrated our cities and streets just to get natural resources.
When he flipped that perspective, I thought about how I would feel.
How could somebody do this to me?
What did I do to deserve this when I'm simply living my life day to day conflict free?
And like you said, dominant groups like to have an us vs. them mentality, which makes them feel more powerful.
In reality, we all share 99.9% of our DNA and no one race or religion is better than another, but its a horrible part about human nature when people start to feel superior to everyone else.
I was also heartbroken after hearing Bassim's story, but his outlook on life post incident was incredibly inspiring.
A student in the class asked how has the change of the US presidency affected Iraq since 2003.
To my knowledge, I thought it would have affected it a lot because the President in the commander in chief dictates if we go to war or not.
However, I am not surprised to find corruption in Iraq.
It is sad and immoral that this is true but the politicians, as was mentioned in the video, accept illegal money to help their own cause.
I also feel bad for the Iraq citizens because of talk of decreasing their already low wages even more.
Time are tough right now, it is hard to find hope, but hope is very much needed in this time.
Talking about perspective is something that I think is important.
When Sam asked how often we correct people when they say ISIS are Muslims, it grabbed my attention.
Like Sam mentioned in class, we tend to have a sort of Islamophobia perspective on people in this nation, and I feel that part of that stems from the media.
Thats something that takes extreme strength and wisdom.
Its not that Bassim no longer feels pain from the loss of his family, but that he has felt that pain and accepted it, which allowed him to move on and focus on his future, rather than trying to change the past.
Somehow people need to be taught about the rest of the world, really grasping a better view of each part of the world.
It would be beneficial for the world to start teaching younger generations about how people of different religions and backgrounds are no different than those who you are surrounded by and live with.
The simple things we take for granted everyday of our lives had just vanished for him.
This video puts into perspective again, all of the lives that are being changed by this war.
Lastly, I believe Sam is right when he talks about how we do not understand what effect history has on the world.
Going into the lecture, I already had a sense of what Sam was showing us.
I had a terrible feeling when Sam showed us his house.
Even if it is is small ways it still pervades our everyday society.
But the reality is, it is just a cultural difference.
When it comes down to it we are all trying to survive and judging people before getting to know them and generalizing cultural characteristics gets in the way of our judgement.
I am not sure what I would do if I faced something like what Bassim faced.
I think that the message that Basim gave us was very important.
We also let the media change our perspective of different places, it is our decision whether to take the information the way the media wants to deliver it to us or we can research and see what is actually going on in the world.
I also find it extremely shocking that he is going to be returning to Mosul in the years to come.
I definitely had made the assumption that all Muslims hated Americans, however Bosim showed us all that this is in no way true.
He has every right to voice his opinion on who the American government needs to change their actions towards the Afghani citizens, since it has taken the lives of so many innocent people.
It was extremely inspiring to hear about his life following the bombings, and how he manages to stay so optimistic.
He uses his religion to guide him through life, and by doing so he is able to be compassionate towards others.
Its hard to believe that someone who has endured so much tragedy still has the power to be so positive and forgiving.
Like you said our only media we see of Afghanistan is terrorists and war, that is why we have the negative images in our head and think so poorly of that country.
I've always just thought of the military as 100% devoted to sole protection.
Again, another opportunity for seeing things from a different perspective arises.
Sam brought up the fact that both countries share so many normal families, people, and things.
Once you can take a step back and look at things in a different way, your understanding or things and ideas that aren't your own suddenly becomes deeper.
Every other class I have ever taken is always based on the past.
I had never thought to think about the innocent people in these countries especially because I feel like our media only portrays the bad people like the terrorists.
Hearing their stories has really made me want to change my life.
I really hope Basim and Rafi can make differences in their countries and help their country rebuild as it should have been ages ago.
Sometimes, it would be easier to just have an Islamic type of divorce instead of settling everything and going back and forth for years and years.
I think that this is where the empathy comes in.
This portion of class I found to be particularly interesting because, once again, I was challenged to look at an aspect of life I was aware of in a whole new life.
Sharia Law is something I had been hearing about since middle school and never really thought much of it.
I thought it seemed like a ridiculous way to govern a society, but I thought it was mostly practiced by terrorist like the Taliban.
Professor Richards enlightened me on the topic of Sharia Law and even put me in the shoes of a person who practices Sharia Law.
You cannot base your laws on a book that is up for interpretation.
Peaceful men like them are hidden behind the violent headlines that Sharia Law causes.
I also felt that it was very redundant and many of the points that the main participants were making weren't really explained or elaborated on.
Additionally, I felt that, as a listener, I was completely uninvolved in the class because Sam was mostly addressing the people acting out the skit.
The time it took to get through the historical part of the lecture left little time to have the class discussion.
I understood the idea behind it, but it just didn't keep my interest.
You mention that the participants had scripts that they had to follow, but I ultimately think that that made the debate weaker, as it didn't allow them to give their actual opinions on the subject.
As a citizen of America, I was not taught about cultures around the world in my education so personally, it was terrible hearing Basim's story.
When you said that this would be all over the news if it happened in America, I believe there would be much more than just news coverage.
The things we get angry about, instantly become meaningless trash when we look from Bassims perspective.
Also, I love how this incident didnt cause him to look at all Americans as one.
It made me so angry to sit and listen to the lack of reparations given to Bassim post tragedy.
This could be because members of ISIS do not look like most of America, or because much of America does not know much about Islam.
I often wonder what it would have been like to take this class the first semester it was taught.
This class forces you to challenge the way you think about things, at least it has for me.
A class like soc 119 needs to be something that people everywhere get to experience and learn from.
Now that we are in college it is too late for many people to gain an opportunity to learn the very important lesson of empathy for those everywhere.
I also find it very interesting that we, here in the United States, never hear of things like this happening.
Schools should be shaping the minds of children, expanding their horizon and actually teaching them about things that matter.
I am sure he felt completely numb at first that is something no one could ever think of on another human being by taking away their family and home.
On top of that, he has no anger against America even with what America had done to his family when they did not deserve anything that had happened.
I agree that anger is a strong emotion that can take over your entire life whether it be a couple days or a couple months.
I am happy to have heard that he is no longer angry anymore and that he had realized in his life that his anger was taking over him and was detrimental to his life.
We have always taken our safety for granted and were raised thinking that it was a good thing that we were sending troops into Afghanistan because that meant that we were going to be kept safe.
Therefore, they have no emotional connection to it that makes them care.
Americans also do not recognize their own faults.
Or if they do it's usually about the terrorist groups in those areas we are trying to take down, rather than the lives of people who are trying to fix their country.
Our generation could be the one to change the stereotype that surrounds the US media and begin to tell whole nation what is actually going on outside of this country.
I agree with everything Hannah said.
There are many people in this world who want to end their lives because they lost everything.
We should use Basim's story to be an example to them that life is precious.
Take the North Korea issue that is going on right now.
I realize that such an experiment may not follow a very scientific approach, but it is enough to make a point.
If the public does not actively keep the government in check then they are forfeiting a lot of power for a select few humans who will, almost definitely, act selfishly.
All resulting in a disaster that leads to something like the current situation in the Middle East and its reputation.
The tragedy of his family's death is one that I wouldn't expect anyone to bounce back from easily.
Bassim's words were very inspiring to me, because I can't imagine having to continue living on after such a tragedy and still be capable of speaking out about it every year.
It comes as no surprise to me the kind of vengeful hatred that is created as an effect of such a taxing war in Afghanistan, but Bassim's story was enlightening.
To know that there are people out there who can forgive such destruction is a model worldview that the rest of the world deserves to understand.
The rest of this world also needs to better interpret their religious beliefs, just as Bassim has in his life.
Most all religious ideologies around the world support the idea of forgiving your fellow man for their actions, yet there have been wars fought all upon the difference of ideologies.
The first question is one that I have personally been wondering about the citizens of Iraq and Basims answer was inspirational.
When listening to his reasoning, it sounded familiar to my own religion of Christianity and that was touched upon by a student who spoke up after Basims answer.
He mentioned that it sounded similar to other religions beliefs and if everyone practiced what they preached the world would be a much more forgiving place.
I chose this video because I really thought this was such a moving part of class-- at least for me.
Especially with the Donald Trump America we are living in today, people do not realize the consequences of kicking immigrants out of our country, especially ones that have lived here all of their lives.
The other part of your post that I thought was good was how you described how he kept going.
Peace was a big part of what Rafi was talking about.
It really makes you see how wrong some people are about the Afghan world.
I think divorce in a family is a curveball you can never fully be prepared for.
In a way, I think it would almost be easier if you could get divorced in a simpler way because it wouldnt make the process drag out so long.
If the divorce just settled fast then I could better acclimate to the new lifestyle changes.
I agree that I am very interested in hearing how the effects of divorce to a person whose parents divorced so quickly like the Quaran says opposed my parents divorce who has been a very long and dragged out process.
These countries all only care about what we are willing to do for them and nothing more than that.
They only care about what the impact is on their own country while that president is in charge for us.
This makes me wonder whether the U.S should be trying to help more, or if we should simply pull out of the country altogether.
It is a hard decision to make because American soldiers are constantly dying in battle over there in an area that often times seems to be running low on hope.
I love how we are learning about things that are actually relevant to our lives and we don't have that disconnect with what is going on around us.
Now I don't really know how to look to far into this but it is odd to me that we tend to, by default, blame religion when its not our own but call people crazy when its a religion thats dominant in our area.
It says something about our country and how our brains are wired.
It also says something about the way we put blame on others.
When Sam explained how he got on Facebook and saw Basims post about how the Americans bombed his house and his brothers house and all of his family members died, my heart dropped.
If all the light in your life was just taken away in a second from a miscalculated bomb that Basim and his family did nothing to deserve.
When I heard this, my mind was racing a mile a minute and I was just so shocked to hear that.
When Sam was going through Basims story, showing pictures, you could hear a pin drop in the 700 person class.
Like I said in my last response, countries in which we are at war with I find hard to picture as regular developed country, but Sam showed me yet again in this video that this is not the case.
We were shown his house, his wife, and his past and I was almost able to establish a great understanding of this man.
I think what is common for people to do is to generalize a whole country to be bad especially when countries go to war or they hear something in the media.
They realized the soldiers they were killing were just like them, and they felt empathy for each other.
Overall, I think people need not to be so quick to assume that a group of people who seem different to them are bad.
Youre supposed to judge people individually based off of their character, and even when doing that don't assume that all people are going to be like them.
Just imagine if everything you cared about was taken from you all at once.
There are so many innocent casualties of war, but that doesn't lessen the suffering that people like Basim go through.
We live in a generation that is largely numb to violence until it is on our doorstep.
I can't even imagine growing up in a place like Iraq that is constantly ravaged by unending warfare.
We wonder why America has so many enemies in the Middle East.
At least some victims are bound to be resentful, and with their way of life taken away, they have nothing left to lose.
I'm not saying that our actions justify terrorism in any form, just that maybe our strategy to oust ISIS is having adverse effects.
I watched the video how are you not angrier with Americans.
He was extremely sad at first, and then very angry, however realized that the anger wasn't good for him and was eating him up.
The war on terror has created such a fear in everyone that lives on America and they are unable to forgive so I find it extremely admirable that Bassim is able to forgive after what was done to him.
By the way he describes his country, it seems clear that corruption is a serious issue in Iraq.
He later mentioned (in a different portion of class) that he has no hope for the immediate future of Iraq, and these two issues are obviously linked.
He also speaks of how the U.S. government must fix the problems they have created.
All of these things lead me to believe that we need a dramatic shift in foreign policy here in the United States.
Although I do not know exactly how this should be done, it is clear that the United States is directly responsible for a lot of the damage in the Middle East, and we are also responsible for the threat of ISIS, as the United States originally funded and armed them as rebels.
For almost two decades, and almost my entire life since I can remember things, the media would show us the extremes, nations that are constantly fighting to the point that we think everyone in that part of the world is like that.
He lead a normal life, had a house similar to what we have in the States, shopped in malls that are similar, and he had a family he loved.
I learned something important that day, that not everyone there hates the US.
He wanted to do good in this life and he took the initiative to do so.
It's crazy how the media depicts people from the Middle East as savages who live in a war crazed culture.
I have a couple of friends who were stationed in Mosul to fight against Isis and liberate them from the city.
All of them say the same things as Sam and have had good interactions with most of the people that are still left there.
They can also contest that Mosul will never be the same again like Basim mentioned.
Someone made a mistake on the job, which caused Basim to lose almost everything he held dear.
I worked for a defense company this past summer and they manufactured some of the aircraft used in the military.
The very same vehicles were also causing destruction on innocent lives.
We have been fortunate enough to since then not have major terrorist attacks.
A lot of them people who used their cars to mow down pedestrians.
A group of protestors were run over by a deranged person.
Sam brings up topics and asks questions that some people would be uncomfortable to ask, or afraid to talk about.
Racial stereotypes, religious views, differing beliefs, and other borderline topics that really do need to be discussed, or else nobody will change their ways of thinking and therefore making no process towards a more peaceful and equal society.
Because Americans only see the violence that radical Muslims have created, they are more likely to believe that these extremists come from a bad religion.
Coming back to what Sam says about empathy.
Empathy is the connection between people who believe in a different God.
I also agree with you, it is very hard to hear that people are suffering because of what America is doing in other peoples countries.
Ive never gotten the chance to speak to someone with such a tragic situation that relates to something Im learning in one of my classes.
I cant believe he isnt an angrier person than he comes off as when we spoke to him in class.
That was the first question that popped into my head, and it was one of the first things a student asked him.
It was as if he knew the question was coming and shook his head before the student could finish asking.
I really agree with everything that you said.
When Sam said his line, they are actually elevated, not oppressed.
Never have I ever thought about the idea that these women are so confident and so respectful of themselves that they have the courage to be who they are and not care what others think of them.
This, in itself, was inspiring to hear and really made me think about the way I view people in society who are different than myself.
I also analyzed this video for my response but I did not discuss the same things that you did.
I talked more generally about how having empathy towards others is so important to make the world a more accepting place but I loved how you discussed the terrorism aspect of this lecture.
Ive always struggled with the fact that marriage is something controlled by the church and the law.
I think for me, it was the picture of the dog that didnt make it that did me in.
Obviously, members of his family passing is horrifically tragic.
I liked what you said about it being a reminder that people need to work together to stop these kinds of conflicts.
I do not think many people can really relate to how he feels with his life because what has happened was truly a tragedy.
I do agree that wars should not be fought this way and that it is unhuman to send bombs on innocent humans because they are human just like we are.
Not only by asking the Iraqi people to change their ways are ISIS intruding on their freedom, but also they are taking over the Iraqi way of life entirely.
Basim used some examples involving clothing, business practices, cultural shifts, and even physical appearance as things that were altered due to the ISIS takeover.
From my previous understanding, ISIS was a terrorist group that hid away in caves and plotted terror attacks, I had no idea just how culturally intrusive they had become.
In America, we view all of our presidents from being different from each other.
They are from different backgrounds, have different policies and belong to different politic parties.
American citizens carefully choose their candidate they want to elect partly based on who they think is going to be able to effectively end the conflicts in the middle east.
This need to project our ideals on other countries leads to insensitivity to the people that live there.
Also, I didn't really think about how his story never even made it to the United States.
That is so messd up to think about... And his story was only one of hundreds probably.
Imagine hearing every single heart-wrenching story that happened to countries we've involved ourselves in.
This is interesting because we believe that each President has their own values, morals and different problems that they would like to solve, but Basim shows us that this is not true.
Putting faces to the Middle Eastern people and truly seeing their struggle opened my eyes to how difficult things really are for them.
To which responded by saying something along the lines of how being angry all the time doesn't change the situation.
This point stuck out to me because many times people go through things in life that may change the course of their life and how they respond to it determines how the rest of their life will be.
But coming into college there were many lessons that i was taught, and most importantly I learned how to see the world in a much more vivid, colorful light.
I find it commendable that Basim has overcame his anger for what happened to his family.
Not that I am trying to make this about myself, but I feel Basim is an inspiration to many who face adversity.
If America faced these same problems, how would we react?
These are the thoughts that ran through my head, which leads me to my next thought.
In turn, our awareness will translate into a more educated society, focusing on the betterment of our relations with other countries.
As Basim has demonstrated, our anger will only get us so far.
I also felt that his comments about holding anger were very poignant.
I have a feeling that helped him show some forgiveness to us tremendously.
When Bassim detailed the events that happened to his family, I was traumatized.
I agree with everything you said here.
Sam starts the video by talking about how his class has evolved and how its so different every year.
I personally love the story about how Sam accidentally converted to Islam, its so funny.
Sam goes onto say how empathy is truly putting yourself in someone elses shoes.
Why do I get uneasy when I see someone with a hijab in an airport?
To simplify the world if you would.
Because I dont understand why 9 11 happened, but 9 11 wasnt caused by everyone whos Muslim and I guess thats where my brain goes astray.
On the top of empathy I feel as though it is a really hard thing to convey.
I really want to start thinking differently than that.
When people from other backgrounds talk about where theyre from I find it so interesting.
It is super important to put yourself in other peoples shoes and to try and see things from all perspectives because then that is how you can fully understand what is going on.
In order to grow, we need to have empathy since it is crucial for a positive learning experience.
I thought this was a great class to sit in on due to the unique dynamic Sam had set up by having race roles reversed.
It was a great idea to have the roles reversed because everyone viewing the lecture had the ability to see the raw emotion of the students who were chosen to speak.
I was a little disappointed with how the group took it, because I felt that it dragged on very long due to the fact that they kept repeating the same come backs.
I understand the point of repetition, since African Americans do hear the same responses repeated over and over again day in and day out But, I feel that everyone should have brought up other points that affect them in their personal lives, like more current day issues.
It would have been great if they expanded upon more issues because this could have brought greater awareness to the audience.
I also feel that other races could have been brought into the mix in the scenario set up in class.
There are many citizens in the Unites States who do not fall under the black or white category.
Hearing a real life story of a human being who was directly affected by the war we are in but know nothing about.
The power of forgiveness in this particular situation is something I don't believe we will be expected to fathom but it is admirable from an outside perspective.
It makes me wonder how things might be different if events such as the one that took place at Basim's house were being reported to the U.S people.
If the army were forced to admit to the acts they were committing they couldn't just sweep these atrocities under the rug and act like they were no big deal.
If they were responsible for being honest with their people I think there would be less bloodshed.
While many people will always turn a blind eye, if Americans knew what we were doing I think there would be efforts to lessen the attacks by the U.S because the government wants to look good in our eyes and wouldn't want the backlash that it isn't receiving by keeping their actions a secret.
Thats the only way a change can ever be made.
I also discussed my opinion of this video and we said a lot of the same things!
If a lot of people would take the time to do what you did, I believe we would do a lot of things so much differently.
Its so admirable to be as forgiving as Bassim is!
Also, I love how Bassim was able to confidently speak on his religion and he didnt care who agreed or disagreed.
I am a spiritual person and I also believe in God.
I too learned about the way muslim women have way more rights than we think they do, it was crazy to hear about how they can divorce freely while so many religions that I know here, people just can't go about doing that.
I would be curious to hear what other things your media has taught you about muslims, as a lot of our media sources tend to have this negative connotation about the religion as a whole.
I think it is the most impressive thing how Basim has not let anger consume his life, and he has forgiven what has happened to his family.
Basim lost everything he loved, The lights of his life.
If I was in Basim's position I would have a hard time saying that statement truthfully.
I think that it is the most respectful thing that Basim has no resentment or hate, loves his American friends still, and does not let the hate of the American government eat him up.
I have the upmost respect for Basim, and I think everyone should take a learning lesson from him about opening our minds and hearts to not let anger consume us.
The question was In your opinion, do you see any difference between the three United States presidents there has been since the invasion of Iraq: Bush, Obama, and Trump.
Although we hear a lot about change, and making America great again, things rarely ever changes from day to day life.
Although the sentiment is the same, things are different in Iraq.
Afghanistan and Iraq usually get lumped together and thought of as being basically the same by many Americans (I was guilty of this myself for the majority of my life), but these past few weeks have been an excellent way of showing that that isn't the case.
But as Basim said, anger will only eat you alive if it is dwelled upon.
Basim stated that his religion helped his deal with these difficult circumstances.
Personally,I am a Christian, andI would certainly rely on my faith when faced with steep adversity.
When he described how this class is a semester on empathy, it made a lot of sense to me.
As Sam said, I saw lens from a different perspective and it is something I think everyone should experience.
Empathy is an intellectual development, which I never thought about before.
Opening yourself up and becoming an empathetic person changes your perspective; people who tend to generalize a population, such as Muslims, as being violent have not opened themselves up to look through another lens, to see the world from someone elses view rather than their own.
Sadly this is what happened to Basim and his family.
To be honest I didn't have this viewpoint coming into this lecture, but am glad to have walked out with a new perspective.
I could not agree more with everything you have said.
Personally, I have lost family members and close family friends.
The fact that Basim attributes his ability to forgive to his faith is a very familiar standpoint that many Americans hold to be true.
How could you not hate something that took your family away?
He spoke about how he felt as though his life had been taken away.
And if this is the case, I am struggling to see how there is no resentment for the institution that took away my family.
I also thought it was interesting to hear a first person account of someone who has lost something irreplaceable by our military.
We tend to think of these countries as violent and associate them too closely with the war when there are real people that live there.
There are families that live there and operate just as our families do in the United States.
That Ifeel would be much more powerful than having to side-step the channel of how the message is delivered.
One benefit from this class so far is finally being able to understand other cultures and other religions that are typically stereotyped as dangerous and see how they really are.
I was not raised Catholic, or had ever experienced the religion much at all, but it was a good education so my parents sent me there.
I was given the opportunity to see first hand if this was something I wanted to believe in.
I was furious when she said this because I was raised in a mostly open family who never mentioned to me that being gay was frowned upon in religions.
He is not a threat to anyone who is living in the United States.
But the Unites States Government decided that bombing his house was somehow beneficial and keeping Americans safe.
I can personally understand if Bassim were to have some sort of hatred towards the American government.
The United States even then offered him a small monetary value as compensation, as if that is at all of equal value as his families lives.
But it is clear after talking to Bassim that that is not the case at all.
Bassim uses his religion to forgive a country full of people who murdered his family in cold blood.
If religion can do that for a man, it clearly has to have some good in it.
Never would I have though I would feel so many emotions in a classroom before.
I chose the video: Introducing Basim Razzo because it was the part of the class that struck me the most.
When he had said everything we needed to know, he then changed the whole class environment in a couple seconds.
It was that moment that Sam explained what had happened to Basim.
I could hear these words resonate in my head and I could feel them stirring my stomach.
Pictures on the slides of the bombing sites just contributed to the shock I was already experiencing.
As we saw all those pictures Basim keep telling us about how he had to deal with everything after the disaster.
The point in the specific discussion which really hit me was the point Dr. Richards made on seeing things from the scopes of other people and religions.
Empathy is something that has been neglected by several White Americans who only see things from the way in which they were brought up.
It was so upsetting to realize that we take so many simple things in our life for granted.
I also thought that Afghanistan till this day was a war torn country with nothing really to offer to its citizens.
Basim will unfortunately never be the same after that day his life had changed forever.
Sharia is a set of religious principles which form part of the Islamic tradition.
Christian sharia is not that any different, many preaches or religious leaders have specific goals in mind they want to achieve.
Facetiming with Basim was very emotional and opened up many doors to the way I think.
A girl in our class asked why he wasnt angry with Americans after everything that happened.
He has many friends that are Americans and they are all good people.
His religion tells him to forgive which I thought was interesting because it was similar to what the past guest speaker, who was Muslim, told us about his beliefs.
I think this is something we should learn from.
Sometimes it is hard to forgive someone for what they did, but after listening to Basim I realized how important it is to forgive.
No matter what religion, it is the right thing to do, even though it is extremely hard.
The clip I chose was what really stood out to me after thinking about the conversation in class.
I always wondered what reactions of Iraqi citizens are when there is deaths of innocent people at the hands of American military.
As seen in the video, the girl asking the question said she would be very angry if that had happened to her.
Basim took us through his emotions when dealing with the tragedy and went on to explain why he doesnt hate American people.
Basim explained that the problem many Iraqi people have with America is with the government.
We should promote the interaction of people from all backgrounds in order to break down barriers we currently have.
I was really taken by surprise when Sam told the story and had him on Skype the whole time.
His story was absolutely incredible and I enjoyed the skype call a lot.
The question she asked was definitely the one at the top of the list in my mind.
Being born into a war torn flag is a crazy scenario and unlike anything that happens in america.
You're certainly right that the impact of war weighs heavier on the people of Iraq, but what also is scary to realize is how distant they are from the dangers that goes around them.
it's a daunting circumstance and I hope it will soon be history rather than news.
If our world was more empathetic, half of the problems that occur wouldn't be there in a sense.
People are so quick to judge or make impulsive actions and even say things impulsively that they can not take back, maybe some they regret, maybe some they do not.
It is amazing how he does not hate the American people for what happened to his family which may sound logical on our end but it was probably harder to forgive than to hate.
He also stated feeling angry for a few months.
This hate could have prolonged and become of something worse because of what the American government did to his family.
While I appreciate and respect their system, it's very dehumanizing to women and is much more of a patriarchal society than we have here in America, at least more blatant.
Forcing a woman who doesn't want to be in a marriage to stay in a marriage is oppression, period!
As someone who was raised Catholic I feel for this topic.
This is kind of beside the point you make however.
Its horrible that the Bible taken literally or even out of context can justificate peoples hatred for a race, gender, etc.
Its also kind of funny because if we did interpret it literally, which you would think would be the best way, we would be stoning people to death and completely unprogressive.
A Class on Empathy.In this video Sam discusses the different ways individuals view people of other religions.
Sam also discusses the common conversation that many people today say.
When we look through the eyes of someone else, our whole perspective changes and our life is sure to be changed.
People need to stop putting the blame on people that are different than them.
Judgements are uneducated people saying things that are completely irrelevant to feel better about themselves.
I agree with you on the point that that ability to take the perspective of another person is a largely important attribute in life.
Having the ability to do this effectively will allow someone to relate to people after seeing it from their point of view.
To truly expand my perspective, I would need to travel the world and live with people in different countries and actually experience their lives first hand.
Until then, taking the perspective of these foreign people who I have previously considered outsiders will help to broaden my perception.
Although everyone in the class knew, historically, the events happened the other way around, even just trying to imagine it being reversed was intended to make the white people in the room think hard about the injustices that have been and are being done to Black Americans.
People often have a tendency to think that those of other backgrounds are exaggerating or even fabricating things to try to make themselves seem like the victim, which rarely is the case.
On another note, I was also pretty floored when I heard the statistic about job prospects for white felons vs. uncharged black applicants.
It was absolutely awe inspiring to me to listen to Basim share his story with us in class.
I cannot even fathom living through the tragedy that he survived.
Not only did he survive physically but his soul survived.
It just really made me start thinking about Americans and the grudges that we hold as a nation.
This man literally had everything blown away in one moment because of wrong coordinates.
But I think that maybe we let that single event influence a lot of our thinking about middle eastern nations.
Im so thankful to have been able to listen to Basim, Raffi, and the US solider talk about their experiences.
It truly has changed my view about what I thought I knew about Islam.
I really appreciated the strength that it took for Basim to speak about the events that happened to him.
I think that if we all tried to live our lives more like Basim, the world would be a better place.
I also admire Basim because I have lost very close family members to tragedy.
Sociology 119 is a class made to openly discuss the universal issues happening currently.
However, most people feel like we are talking about Islam too often during lecture.
As Sam pointed out, this is because Islamophobia is present very openly in society.
The whole point of the class that we are ALL taking by personal choice this semester is to open up our eyes to the problems of the world.
Empathy is a big value that sociology 199 is trying to imprint in Penn State students for a long time.
But if something is broken, then why do things the same each time a presidents term is over?
I also do hope that someone breaks this cycle.
I agree with you also that this was a very eye opening class.
Imagine personally if a U.S solider accidentally killed your family in the hunt for a terrorist.
I think that everything you are saying is completely right.
Our nation was meant to be a place for religious freedom, somewhere anyone could escape from religious persecution.
If all you ever needed to get there was just to be a good person in life, why does it matter whether people follow the bible word for word?
They don't take in news from multiple sources so they can make their own informed decisions.
These are questions I'll almost definitely never know the answer to, but people like Basim might.
I completely agree with what you are saying here.
For me, personally, I view Afghanistan way more positively than I did a month ago because of these two men.
Basims house and family was destroyed by Americans, yet he does not hold any animosity toward our country.
I think that is an amazing hobby that you have found to love.
Having the mindset of openness to actually going out and meet new people or try new activities truly makes life more worthwhile.
We do have a habit of sugar-coating our history, and usually present it in a way that favors America.
This does us no favors in growing in solidarity to become a stronger country.
It is almost as if kids are raised in a bubble throughout their education, only to find that the real world is much different than the idealized world they were presented with.
I think that in some cases the ability to interpret spiritual writings is very important because we all have different life experiences.
This can be very beneficial because people tend to read things in a way that they benefit from it.
I completely agree with everything you have said in this response.
I personally found this class to be my favorite one thus far.
Ithink that Basim has to be one of the kindest most genuine people I have ever interacted with.
Basim inspired me to also really take a good look at my life and learn to appreciate the relationships that I have.
He also has motivated me to get back in touch with my faith.
I do consider myself to be a Christian, but I don't keep up with my faith as well as I should, and if Basim was able to learn to forgive the United States for all of the pain that they had caused him, simply because that is what God wants, then I think that establishing a faith like that is something that I believe will be extremely beneficial to my outlook on what life throws my way.
I did miss class one day on a Tuesday so maybe this is that class.
However, I chose to watch and respond to this particular video because the heading really caught my interest.
I kind of laugh at how people from outside of the United States see no difference in the presidents here when it seems that us, Americans, cannot stop talking about it.
Many people do not like it and are constantly bashing him when compared to the past president.
It funny how despite all the differences between them, they all seem to agree on the corrupt policies that have to do with the Iraqi people.
Prior to this course, if you would mention Iraq people to me I would have ill thoughts towards them because of the war but now I realize that that isnt the case.
Whites aren't usually pressed when it comes to racism.
And I agree with the stance of the invincible feeling of the weather not effecting me personally and it is easy to stand by.
But we must take steps, donate, raise awareness to do everything in our power to help.
I can relate to this response because I as well read A Thousand Splendid Sons and have dealt with divorce from a personal level as well.
However, after this lecture, I will begin to see things from a different perspective and be less susceptible to judging.
I come from a Christian home and sometimes neglect to see other cultures eye to eye because I am involved in only my practices.
I personally tend to be someone to hold grudges and get angry, so something like this would have ruined me.
This is something I think many people struggle with; as you said, he understood this is a war against governments, not people, which can be a hard concept to grasp.
This tells you that the world around us is constantly evolving around is, so that means we can talk about various issues and topics each year.
I see him as having so much strength.
It would be extremely hard for anyone to forgive and not be angry, but especially when it was caused by an enemy.
It opened my eyes to a lot and made me think more critically about the way we see the world.
I found it so inspiring how Basim said he doesnt hate America; it just shows how kind and genuine he is.
I think that if I were in his position, it would be hard for me to accept America as a whole.
I truly was able to see who Basim really is throughout the short conversation we had with him.
I always believed that it was so different but i never really bothered to look in to it.
After realizing that Bassim and his family lived a life very similar to mine, I thought to myself that if that happened in the United States, it would be all over the news.
The most amazing thing that I saw that day was how forgiving Bassim was.
Forgiveness is I think something that takes courage and is not easy for some people to do.
Most religions hold the same common moral and human values and should not be discriminated against because of the few bad nuts in each.
I never find a person so willing to accept many different religions, or none at all (he also said he was willing to be called an atheist).
I am so perplexed by how it is someone could live by so many different mantras.
Furthermore, I am curious how a Islamic person would feel if he claimed to be Islamic just because he was in a mosque.
But to travel there and experience something like a culture or a religion in the most complete way possible is in my opinion the only way one could even consider calling themselves someone from another religion.
I agree with everything you are talking about.
After all the reading videos we watched for class, it opened my eyes to how similar we are to other countries.
When thinking of some other countries we automatically think of war, terrorism, etc.
I feel as though us Americans are so closed minded to life in other countries and have opinions about them when in reality we know nothing about them.
We have so much to be thankful and can only hope such horror won't be seen in our country one of these days.
China had massive wars and genocides every 50 years or so.
China also engaged in war with Russia and Japan often, and, would you have guessed more people died?
Life is suffering.
We need to compare the past of our environments with others, if we are truly going to dislike America.
It's really atrocious that we have to work to get unbiased legitimate news and thats its nearly impossible to get news about things like that which happened to Basim.
Sam Richards is right the military is to protect us but it is also a business.
If another country came to America for our natural resources, we would not allow that.
I was wondering the same thing that Stacy asked, which was when she asked him how is he not angry with the United States.
His religion believes in forgiveness, and that's what he did.
We never get to hear personal stories such as Basim's, so, listening to his story made me feel completely awful.
I found this topic very interesting too because I felt like it was very different from the way it is here in America.
The whole money aspect of the divorces confuse me but it was interesting learning more about that topic.
I thought it was a strange thing that despite being divorced, the father still has to provide for the children.
Like Ilana said, it makes sense because then the mother will not be completely on her own to take care of the children.
I would've snapped and I don't know if I would've ever been able to be myoriginalself again.
But I really enjoyed the parallel you drew between the Muslim religion and Christianity.
I think that this is something that is too often overlooked by Americans.
I think that a lot of these stereotypes come from what we think about the Taliban, 911, etc.
Just because a few bad people come together with these radical ideas- should not reflect on a nation in its entirety.
I think as a country we continue to take two steps forward and then two steps back and no matter what there is some sort of racism or at least negative stereotyping of other cultures religions countries.
Is an act only terrorism if its done against US citizens?
Is it only considered terrorism if the perpetrator does it in the name of Allah?
Theres something to be changed in our morality, and it can only truly be reached through dialogue.
When Donald Trump came into office, his plan to bring troops back into Afghanistanhas been under some scrutiny.
The government is still not the best, but people were doing what they can to stay alive.
I do understand it can be hard to get the laws and policies of the country changed, however it seems as though no President has taken action to do so.
Because the media makes it seem as though recent presidents such as Obama were solving problems in the middle east, however what we see as a problem may be different than what Basim sees as a problem.
I also think that Americans believe that they are more involved in other countries than they are.
Although, the class later learns through skyping Basim that he has very little resentment towards the United States.
He said he believe god chose him to survive to move forward and further achieve his goals in life.
So it was good for the class to see a different way of perceiving things.
I personally loved the stories that Basim shared and the personal reactions he presented to us.
It is an unspeakable tragedy that Bassim cannot realistically foresee the children living in a better, safer Iraq than the one he has been subject to for decadesbecause Bush and Clinton politics are not anything knew.
And still I wonder, if the United States does not intervene, who will save the Iraqi people from another brutal dictator?
An important chord that Bassim struck with me was the point that Iraqs true problem is corruption.
This contributes to the bleakness that permeates Bassims vision of Iraq in the future.
I could not imagine what it would be like to lose almost everyone you love at the hands of another country for essentially no reason.
He lives his life with hope and is thankful for what he has and does not go around spreading hate and anger.
After hearing Bassim speak and tell his story I almost could not believe it was a true story; everything he went through and how he was treated was completely unacceptable.
It astonishes me that he has the fortitude to continue to live his life the way he does because if I were in his position I do not think I would be able to be as calm as he is.
I would never let that go and I would never forgive the people who caused me that sort of pain.
Basim said that at first, after the accident he was angry but eventually he realized that the anger was hurting him more than it was benefiting him.
However, Basim was able to forgive Americans over probably the biggest devastation he will ever experience in his life, and I think that is truly inspiring.
What happened to Basim's family, as a result of American's is something that I myself can't imagine every being able to forgive.
He was able to forgive the people that caused his home to get bombed and move on to a more tranquil stage of his life.
It honestly gives me hope that some people can understand that you shouldnt generalize a whole group of people because a few did something evil.
I appreciate that we were able to directly communicate with him because it was an interesting learning experience.
One thing thats important that we can take away from that lesson though was that you can't come to hate an entire group of people for the wrong doings of a few people.
The numbness and disconnection from the rest of the world would've been so isolating any man would be at the edge.
So for Bassim to be able to make it out of that numb stage alone is no small feet at all, rather that itself is an incredible achievement.
However, Bassim got passed that as well.
Yet, he did not even bother to talk about it because he immediately talked about his forgiveness.
That last one is arguable, but the story we are told of the Revolutionary War and Civil War do not match up quite to the reality.
If anything, its more of a war about the fear of the slaves being freed, since, of course, the South seceded before this freeing occurred.
I was again surprised by many of the statistics that I found.
The American soldier was not alone, 63 percent of young Americans are unable to find Iraq on a map according to the National Geophic Societys Roper poll.
The same survey also found that 75 percent of Americans could not find Israel or Iran.
I wonder why one of the richest and most powerful countries in the world struggles so much with world geography.
Bassim Razzo advice to the class brought up a good point which also made me a little bit scared.
The geographical barriers which created social barriers are becoming increasingly irrelevant as technology advances.
The media uses that term immediatelywhen a Muslim commits an act of crime.
These individuals also usually consider themselves to be devout Christians.
Basim was one of those innocent people whose home was destroyed.
When Sam showed us the pictures of his beautiful home and family before the mistaken bomb struck his home I felt sympathy for him.
He lost his wife, daughter, brother, his nephew, and his dog yet he forgave.
So many innocent people die daily, but the public chooses to show what they think is important and ignore the causalities of the minorities.
I think that this is very clear in your response and you conveyed it with great detail and sympathy especially when you mentioned that the American bashing should stop because the discussion of American history and previous mistakes in a sociology lecture should be a lesson for future generations.
No one should have to go through what Bassim has had to go through in his life.
The unfortunate part about the entire situation is that there are many more people in a similar position and situation as Bassim that no one knows about.
How can you take so much from a person, acknowledge you made a mistake, and then refuse to help that person?
We might be from different places and live in different countries but we are all human beings.
His explanation made perfect sense and showed the strength and faith he had in his life.
He realized that without forgiveness he wouldn't be able to continue living his life.
The anger, the emotions, the shock he felt was crippling and was causing him to diminish the opportunity he had since his life was spared.
So when Basim mentioned that, I automatically understood what he meant.
Something that I think was surprising to a majority of the class was the actions the United States government had taken.
There was no justice or accountability for our actions, which now is all Basim desires.
In a way its a really scary thought to think that the people who are supposed to be the one protecting us can be the ones who are the most careless.
It makes me feel sadness for the pain that he went through because it honestly couldve easily been avoided if the United States had been more careful.
I, like many other people, thought that these women were oppressed by the men in their culture.
I liked what one of the girls said about how wearing a hijab lets you behave more freely because youre thinking less about your appearance and more about the experiences you have.
I think we need to have more lectures like this one because it shows the importance of conversation and how they help break common assumptions.
I also feel like I do not think about this kind of thing enough, but I wonder if it is our fault.
it seems like our country tends to avoid reporting on such gruesome and tragic stories.
His response is what truly caught my attention.
He was always taught to forgive and this was an incident where very few people would handle it the way Basim did.
If more Americans spent time in Iraq and met people like Basim I feel major changes could be made.
I have rarely met citizens outside the United States, let alone the country we are at war with.
I knew there were innocent people like Basim being affected by this war, but to actually see it in person was what really made the war a reality.
Therefore, change can only be made one person at a time and if all learn to forgive the way Basim did, then there is a chance the world can be a better place again.
The Reason being that we are looking at the wrong end of the problem .
He states that it is absolutely important to view other cultures from their perspective.
For example, black people are not darker in skin color because they are less evolved and closer to primate ancestors that white people ar.
This is a level of grace that cannot be said for a lot of Americans here.
I always thought that we have every right to get involved in the war.
Don't get me wrong, I still feel that we needed to react with some type of action like dropping a bomb for the loss that we, Americans, faced on September 11th.
Not all Americans support the war and it certainly wasn't all of our decisions to do what we did so I sure hope that he doesn't hate all of us in America.
I really respect his efforts of living a life in peace and think that many others should give it a try too.
Next, Mr. Razzobegins by discussing the changes ISIS brought to his home city of Mosul.
It is really inspiring listening to people like Razzo talk about their experience living life in a war.
It is a perspective that most of us have not and will not ever experience in our lifetimes, which makes it that much more important to hear from a man who went through this suffering first handedly.
But maybe that's the problem some people don't know the distinction.
Some people who commit heinous acts and justify it with their religion actually believe what they're doing is good.
But again, if people only focused on the good, we could only hope we'd see better outcomes.
Many people stereotype, but dont understand how similar we are.
Media only shows us the violence that some Muslims have created, which makes us believe that is how they all are.
The opposite can apply as well, if Muslims only saw all of the hate Christians perform, they would not have very good images of us as well.
I also agree with you that people should set aside their judgement, we would be able to create empathy between each other.
I like how you bring up how the conversion from christianity to muslim that there is so much acceptance for other peoples views that you can take them home with you and practice something from a different culture.
We don't always get to see the other view point because it is so hard to relate but Sam makes it pretty easy to see the other side and really embrace it.
I like how you highlight about how people bring up radical islam but there is little said about christians.
When these bad things happen in the U.S. with religious people it is immediately disassociated with the religion and instead it's just inherently awful person.
Everything that happens in our country always seems like its the most important thing in the world, when in reality there are so many other things going on in the world.
The only issues we seem to hear about from other countries are major events that come nowhere near to grasping the reality of the situation in foreign nations.
It is almost like they never left the United States because they do the same things they would do at home.
I too couldn't help notice the similarities that Basim has to a typical family here in the United States.
But that could not be more wrong.
I believe that class really opened my eyes and the eyes of everyone in that class when regarding loss of life from war.
It's easy not to think about death from war because the casualty numbers are usually high and made up of people we do not know personally.
However, stories like Basim's make everyone realize that when people die in war, real families are affected deeply by their losses.
And also, why did you think they were all terrorists?
The reason this post is so interesting to me, because I think we need to understand why people believe what they do.
Coming from a very chaotic country as is Venezuela, I cannot bring myself to forgive the people from the government that has brought my family, friends and fellow Venezuelans so much pain.
Meanwhile, I think we can all agree that his story is an inspiration to all of us and it helped us learn that we can always move forward and overcome whatever we are going through by looking for peace elsewhere.
To see a specific example of the ramifications of the US's involvement in Iraq really gives you a new perspective on the war.
I never really imagined ordinary working class people, like those you would find in the US, who were just trying to get by and were not greatly concerned with religion.
This video shows us a man who seemed to be very well off.
I think the reason for this and the media's depiction of Iraq, is to maintain support for the war.
So we aren't shown the Muslims who live like we do.
I think that it is often forgotten when the realization comes of what happens after the war?
Families living in these war-torn countries must decide between leaving their home (if they are able to) or stay and hope that their family and property isn't destroyed.
It was beyond hard to hear Basim's answer to the question of if he thinks Mosul or Iran will ever be the same.
So many countries have come from the ashes of war but the Middle East has been affected in a way that almost does seem irreversible.
This is a realization not everyone comes to after a tragedy.
He states that he does not have hatred for any American, because all he witnessed was the good.
Even in tragedy, some can still find the good in the world.
We should all take a lesson from him and let go of our anger over things that are much less significant.
Basim responded by revealing that because of his Muslim traditions, he forgives America despite the loss of his family and his home in Iraq.
Therefore, the best option based on his religious beliefs was to forgive America.
Barely having a father figure in my life took a toll on me growing up, so he and I stopped talking for five years.
We made amends and I feel so much better.
Granted, its fine to be angry, but its not healthy to hold on to that anger for so long; forgiveness is key.
I think about them in my head and common association include those extremists groups that are doing terrible things to people all the over the world at the moment.
Most people would be angry and would naturally want revenge, despite their religion, for a tragedy like his but Basim keeps that peaceful mindset which is truly admirable.
I can not say I've been through what he's gone through but I can sympathize.
We should show some sympathy with these other people that are going through these things because of our country instead of believing the media like all Muslims are terrorists.
Even though this phrase is not always physically impossible, its mentally, extremely challenging.
Getting to know someones personality and mannerisms can give you a sense of who the person is and how they deal with things.
Despite physical appearance, you can sometimes find many similarities between you and someone else by just learning a little more about them and maybe asking a few questions.
Doing this can help you become more of an open-minded person, your views on the world and others will change.
I cannot fathom how much it takes to not hate the people that killed your family, yet at the same time I can not comprehend how much it takes to be understanding.
This man understands that it was not all of the American people that did this to him.
This also translates to how Americans think about other people.
it is because it took one group of people to change the way we think about their race of people.
I think that fear is a divisive tool that can prevent even the best intentioned people from feeling empathetic towards another human being.
Sometimes it feels as if the media works to fuel fear about certain religious groups like Muslims, but downplays acts of christian violence and talks about them as if they are outliers isolated incidences and refrain from using language relating to terrorism, even when christians commit acts of terror.
I also appreciate that Sam describes this class and teaches it as a class on empathy.
Sam tackles hard subjects gracefully: homeland security after 9 11 and the military operations that the United States has taken.
I think that's a result of growing up in a closed community but by a community, I do not mean your neighborhood.
If the caretaker incorporated an open-world policy of acceptance and empathy similar to that of Sam's TED Talk, I believe that the world would not only be better informed but a better place as well.
To circumvent this, Sam humanized Basim's life.
Sam demonstrates that the Iraqis were living life normally before the war and that their lives were not so different from you and I's.
Then the normal life that most Iraqis lived changed so dramatically.
Downtown Mosul is a fragment of the bustling city it used to be.
I would feel angry and demand an explanation at first, but that would change to worthlessness and lost hope.
He has forgiven the Americans who did this, which is unfathomable to me.
Would someone have put a stop to the madness?
Despite all of the clear problems that exist throughout their culture, the government seems to never change anything.
There are many governments throughout the world that are full of corruption and unable to change, or just unbothered by the fact that there are many problems that impede those living in their society.
Thankfully, I am part of a government that cares about their people, although it doesn't seem like we care about others.
Being selfish in this case, isn't entirely a bad thing and trumps a government that is corrupt and uses their people to propel themselves forward.
I would not be able to walk in his shoes at all, like you said i would constantly be seeking revenge also, I already can't live without my family and if that happened I don't know what I would do it would constantly haunt me day and night.
I agree with what you said about how the bombings and horrible acts of war committed was the U.S. Government not the people.
When I talk to most Americans they have such pride in this country.
I do not think that most people really know much about what is going on with the United States involvement with the Middle East.
I have heard statistics about the number of civilians the U.S. armed forces have killed but talking to someone affected by it makes it so much more real.
I hope awareness can be raised and that as a country we can do better.
So all people who want to achieve their goal of going to heaven or reach god must partake in a set of steps to achieve that goal.
Anyhow both will lead to lack of human progress in life.We can fight this sets of ideas that happen to be extreme, regressive or ultra conservative.
While sitting in class, I also had the same thoughts.
It is a tragedy that this happens regularly, and bringing more troops in will not solve the problem.
This is why communication is important, so individuals can understand that not everyone is astereotype.
It is almost unfathomable to even make one step towards forgiving the people and the flag that took away your loved ones.
Bassim is a better person than the rest of us for truly defining what it means to be strong and brave.
His forgiveness is given in the hopes that something good will come out of all this evil and death and suffering.
Bassim taught a classroom of college kids some lessons that we would never get, otherwise.
I think it is truly amazing how much Bassim forgives America for what was done to him.
His faith is so strong that he can use it to guide him to forgiveness.
Bassim lived in America for a little while, therefore he had the opportunity to experience the average American male.
I wonder whatit would be like if many Americans had the chance to go live there and experience the average Muslim man.
I also thought it was interesting to hear Basim share his story with us.
No one should ever have to go through the tragedy that he experienced, and listening to him talk about what he went through in front of 500 strangers was very inspirational.
However, he declines this recommendation, even though he has two daughters to keep in mind.
What motivates this man to put his life on the line every day?
It takes a mature and influential type of person to chase after his or her dream of peace, ignoring the potential restrictions.
I feel inspired that his understood encouragement by his people of Afghanistan compels him to continue to fight against the people who wish harm.
The statements he makes are all valid in my opinion and I think they are worth being noted.
When Bassim opens up about the schooling around us it really begins to open my eye.
He stated that he believes there is a significant lack of geography in our teaching.
I completely agree with this statement because I feel like even myself would like to know more about geography.
I also like this video a lot because he brings up media in our American society.
I think we should take his advice and try to avoid the media as much as we can, especially if its negative media.
But to fight off that last detail, that thought is probably because theres so much to cover.
Eventually, theyll turn on each other because theyll always be thinking about how their own selves are going to survive.
Lots of times in history including social-psychology experiment teach this about human nature.
However, if the worst parts of Christianity or insert whatever religion here were to have a total reset in their community and overall religion, it would drastically change the world for the better.
If we want a class about empathy, other than learning the histories of other backgrounds, we should consider defining our own values as individual humans.
Listening to Bassim speak about forgiveness and moving on really gave me perspective of the culture of the afghan people who populated the warzones our own military fought at.
I also have the utmost respect for him and letting his religion guide his everyday decisions.
I am so lucky to have been able to witness this interview in a classroom setting.
He had his entire life change in an instant due to an American bombing that hit the wrong location.
We have been fortunate to not have any wars in our country so I dont think we truly understand what it is like.
The media portrays us as the best country in every situation which may not always be true.
My final thoughts have to do with the reason we got involved with Iraq in the first place.
It makes sense that they could have been monopolizing the prices but I feel like those issues couldve been resolved without any violence and killing.
When Basim was asked about his thoughts on seeing Mosul return to a normal way of life in the future, he answered with a resounding no.
The people of Mosul and the rest of the area that is involved with ISIS must continue to fight back and show the rest of the world what they believe their real image should be.
We never ask questions to people that we may not understand.
All in all, I really like your call for discussion because it would alleviate so many pressures we face today.
The random connection that Basim and Sam made after his TED talk became popular is a great story by itself, but Basim's experience and attitude is even more incredible.
I can't imagine losing seemingly everything in an instant the way that Basim did.
By the end of Sam's slideshow, I was feeling angry on behalf of Basim and imagining the rage he feels towards the United States.
It was crazy and surprising to see him just appear on the screen and talk to us about his life since then.
I'm still not really sure what the answer is in terms of a solution for military conflicts like Iraq in the Middle East, but I do think that allowing more people to have interactions with people like Basim would go a long way towards building understanding between cultures and nations.
To hear from him first hand and to listen to him describe his loss was absolutely devastating.
I agree with what you said about how our governments actions should not reflect on all of the American people.
I also agree with you that the American government should create some type of organization that will help those wrongly affected in the Middle East like Bassim.
Every day I hear news about the United States and the role that it plays in the world, especially with the current war on terror in the greater Middle East.
I find that often Americans hear news of radical terrorists who threatento destroythe United States, yet there is another side of the news that very rarely gets reported.
Also, the machinery used nowadays is much more advanced and the tactics involved are much sneakier.
That is why Basim's family was the target of an accidental bombing.
However, Basim does not hold any malice towards Americans becausehe realizes that we are not our government.
He also said that living with hate would get him nowhere in life and would only making going on without his loved ones much harder.
This slave trade not only targeted a specific ethnicity of people, with a specific religion, but also did not enslave any Muslims within this system.
This could be a decent retort, if the Islamic peoples of the Middle East did not first raid Spain, killing thousands of Christiansfirst.
He explains how he feels comfortable labeling himself as basically any belief, which I believe, enables him to touch on any subject revolving around those religions.
Sam used a great example on how people are quick to judge another religion like Islam, and say that Muslims are violent people because of acts that have been carried out by few.
It is ignorant to think of oneself as above others when the reasons for seeing them as lesser can be applied to oneself as well.
It is hard to say what is right and wrong with religion because no one really knows.
Well, everyone who is some type of religious will defend that they do know, but because there are so many knowns it becomes unknown.
Christianity itself is split into different branches for a reason.
Most of society connects it to the radicals who act in violence rooted in their faith of God.
There will never be just one way to interpret religion, and society for some reason is still not in tune with that, and is ready to call out the bad for some, while never really seeing the good.
When Basim saidhe didn't see change throughout the different administrations I was surprised and disheartened.
However after hearing Basim speak, I also felt powerless.
I realize there is no recipe for change, but it seems like in today's media landscape it's impossible to get certain stories to be heard.
He felt numbhe didnt know how to feel, as if it was surreal.
Razzo could easily be one of the most justifiably angry individuals in the world, and yet, somehow he manages to keep his anger from getting the best of him.
Unfortunately, Isis serves us the constant reminder that history repeats itself in different terms.
As long as there are religious differences, humanity will continuously endure these extreme wars.
Interference such as foreign interests in money and oil deposits definitely fuel the fire, but opposing extreme religious views are the key driver.
The specific video that I am going to talk about is the one where my classmate asks Basim how he isnt angry at America.
It made us realize that the people that we hear about getting killed over seas, are real people.
At that point everyone had empathy for him because we now know him.
But it wasnt like I didnt know this kind of stuff was happening over there.
I just felt it more because I was talking to someone who had been through such tragedy that was caused by something he had nothing to do with.
Basim said that he was angry at first but not so much anymore.
He said that it isnt America that he should be mad at but our government.
The way that people think practically revolves around the government.
If I was Basim, I would not fuck with anything that comes out of America.
We get very wrapped up in the wars that we are fighting and only looking at the extremists and only paying attention when something big enough happens that it gets news attention.
It seems incredibly unfair to me that we are on two different sides of the war, yet, because we are this military superpower that has gone into these countries, we dont suffer the day-to-day civilian casualties that they experience in these other countries.
The story that he told in this video about the kids circling the soldiers with the incense and then getting shot for that is appalling to me.
I understand that countries have lots of traditions so it seems somewhat implausible to ask all the soldiers to learn all the customs of a country.
If we had to fight wars on our land rather than going to other places and essentially invading them, the United States would be a lot more cautious about going to war with other nations.
Realizing the impact we are having on foreign civilians could help the United States have a better reputation in the world and prevent the further damage to civilians.
And in wake of this, American soldiers returned home treated as an enemy.
Well he clearly mentions that Christians do the exact same thing, but one here talks about it.
If we teach the youth early about the lessons in empathy, in seeing the world in a different perspective, then we have a chance at achieving a world of peace.
He soon realized, however, that his anger was eating him alive.
It was not the American people that he hated.
I, for one, am appalled that the American government could be so cruel as to look over the lives of so many innocent civilians for the sake of war.
We are lucky to be able to take a class in which we can connect with people from all over the world.
However, Sam made an interesting point about how people never say this about radical Muslims.
This is because America is mostly Christian and many people fail to recognize the connections between Christianity and Islam that Sam points out in class.
If you suggested such an opinion to an American adult, they would probably attack your viewpoint on all fronts.
I am not much of a guy of faith and that is primarily because of how vague, incomplete and yet rigid some religious texts and guidelines can be.
They can never be used to successfully run a society even though many people who have experienced prosperity because of the separation of the church and the state, might want to unify them once again.
And whatever privilege they may want or achieve because of whatever group they call themselves part of, wont last long, leaving them to deal with harsher consequences, in my opinion.
What Bassim said was extremely heart felt.
Although the United States destroyed his home and family, he is not angry with the United States, rather disappointed in our government.
His forgiveness stood out to me because here in the United States we hold a grudge against Muslims for what happened during 9 11.
So one key thing to take from Bassim is not to hold onto the anger with in us.
We have to forgive and let it go because we do nothing withholding all of the anger within us.
Moreover, Bassim family got torn apart, yet he found a way to forgive.
It takes a lot for one person to forgive such a crime.
Also, makes me feel disgusted about America and how.
Not too long ago there was a Muslim ban for our protection, like why would we need protection from a group of people that follow a particular religion.
Last week, I was in my SOC 119 lab and we were talking about how President Trump put the ban on Muslim people.
Yes, 9 11 was caused by a radical group who claimed to be Muslim, but that does not mean that every Muslim person is evil, untrustworthy, or a terrorist.
Not that people want to purposely discriminate against them but that some people actually are triggered by Islamic people, even though it is not accurate.
Therefore, we tend to judge Islamic people more.
While listening to Sam tell the tragic story of his friend he really pulled me in that day.
Hearing the story of Basims loss of his loved ones seemed like a story that was too sad to be real.
I remember how much my heart dropped when I first saw his face.
This man had lost almost everything and yet he was spending his day talking to us with nothing but smiles.
Basim never thought that morning that he would lose his family members that were so close to him.
To me, forgiveness is one of the biggest lessons to learn in life and it seems that Basim really has this figured out.
But when I look back and think about all of the times I have forgiven somebody none of those times are on such a great scale as Basim forgiving what happened.
He is able to recognize that not all American citizens are to blame for his tragedy yet it is the government.
He says that his religion teaches him to forgive and Christianity also does the same.
I believe forgiveness is something that all people should learn to value and practice more often.
I was thoroughly intrigued by the video A Class on Empathy, and thought that it was a lecture that needed to be vocalized.
It's also true that Americans, white Americans, will state that KKK members are somewhat separated from the Christian faith even though they clearly express their loyalty to their religion.
He's also correct in stating that empathy is the key to intellectual maturity and growth.
I hope that this lecture has opened the mind of at least one person in class, though, because every bit helps.
This reminds me of the pen-pal system that most of us had in middle school or elementary school.
It is really awesome that Sam and Bassim are able to do this frequently.
Hearing this guy speak has been nothing but intriguing to me.
God forbid that there is ever a war on US soil, but US soldiers fighting overseas should pull enough attention towards US citizens.
The world we live in today is extremely selfish.
The pictures he sent were really worth more than 1000 words.
I found his assessment of the status of Mosul to be exceptionally accurate because Basim also spent 8 years living in the United States.
Basim did briefly talk about the fighting which has forced his people into this war-like atmosphere.
I have read this book as well, and even still I feel as though there is so much I do not know about the afghani people.
The book you speak of is excellent, and I enjoyed reading it very much.
I have not read any of Husseini's other works, but after reading this I feel inclined to do so.
On the other hand, there are obviously many parts of life that can not necessarily be understood through books.
So although books are a good way to make yourself cultured, I still believe thatit is important to travel as well to try and fully understand another's culture.
To hear someone say that their country has turned for the worst and will likely not improve anytime in the foreseeable future, is a bit out of the ordinary for a middle class white kid to hear.
But recently I have realized maybe it should.
Personally I am not a Donald Trump supporter but he has done what he said he would do from the beginning.
Those people are evil and unless we kill them I really don't see what is going to stop them from killing us.
We need to continue to bomb them because I feel it is the only way to save innocent lives.
I wish there was another more peaceful way to handle the war that seems inevitable but I think that war might be the only solution.
This lecture was a very powerful one that definitely will not forget it.
The part when Sam flipped the story caught my attention as well.
The little things that Americans complain of these days probably seem like nothing to some Afghans because of what they have to go through on a day to day basis.
I personally take my safety for granted and should keep in mind how lucky I am to live in this country.
Instead of being forced to memorize formulas or vocabulary, we just get to learn about things that are so important in our society, and I love that.
However I think that part of it is because in the past 10 yearswe hear more about terrorism led by Muslims than any other religious violence.
I think that empathy is valuable when it comes to interacting with other people, not just religion.
Without empathy it's difficult to see that one person's religion is no better or worse than another person's religion.
But I guess that is part of the reason whywe have different denominations in the first place.
They are unable to differentiate between the radical Muslims, and the Muslims who simply call Iraq home.
They see no difference between the Muslims who want war and the ones who want peace.
I cannot even fathom waking up one day with everything I have ever known taken away from me, and not holding resentment towards the nation or body of people who were responsible for it.
Sam talks about how in Muslims are now labeled as terrorists by the US citizens just because of a group of ISIS terrorists running around terrorizing the a small part of the world.
Once we realize how we are not different this will all resolve.
I don't think so.
I believe we are different and we will always look at someone differently because I we are not them or I am not you.
This is because if I call ISIS Muslim I am basically implying all muslims act like ISIS and this is completely wrong.
There are many Iraqis that do not understand America as there are many Americans that do not understand Iraq.
If every single person on the planet understood and believed in that, there would be virtually no conflicts.
But that seems to be a far resolution granted there are violent military actions being completed day-to-day.
which lead to a lot of hate and tension towards them, even though not all muslims are like that.
In the past christians had wars, which took many lives, also there are certain groups that proclaim Christianity.
people have to give each other a chance before they assume, if the world is to get better and improve.
I know not to characterize all muslim as bad, because they are all not, people like Muhammed ali, Malcom x , and so on were muslim but good people.we must learn to put our negative stigmas of people asides.
SO what does the United States do?
But the United States is determined to fight terror abroad.
It is scary to think of the sort of destruction that the United States is capable of abroad.
Just like you, I attended Catholic school my entire life so I can see exactly where you are coming from.
My entire life I was taught that the Bible is the only way we should live our lives.
We are allowed to follow what we truly believe in and not what others interpret as the right way.
If he was able to forgive Americans for bombing his family, I feel it is time as a society we start accepting others as individuals and not an entire religion.
Maybe that was the only thing left for him, but it is amazing that he was able to find peace with this.
The Quran is not a very big book, but yet, it is used to make a whole set of laws, which is probably impossible in such a short book due to how many issues there are nowadays.
There are probably different levels of it based on how those Muslims interpreted the Quran.
Yes, there are some Muslims that probably take it to the extreme, but that does not mean that all of them do.
The U.S. government should have compensated Bassim much better for the amount of damage they did to his dwelling and his own family!
When Sam was telling the story, I felt distant.
I vividly remember how I felt when Sam said So now we're going to meet Basam.
How would we feel if that happened?
Well then, if it is too sad or inhumane, why do these cruel war acts continue to be done?
Hearing the story of Bassim was very eye opening to me though.
He lost so many things he loved and for what reason?
i I really understand a lot about empathy and I feel sad because I think our idea of war is all wrong.
These lifestyles are the identities that differentiate ourselves from one another.
But then you bring up how similar we actually are and imply 'if only the hostile ones saw that'.
That's why humans try to differentiate themselves from others (other than the obvious ignorant reasons of course).
I feel like there could have been so many other ways to handle the issue.
Basim had his whole life change due to an American mistake and we need to accept responsibility.
PTSD is another issue that comes from war.
I thought it was also interesting how you included the media portraying war as glorifying.
Overall, I pretty much agreed exactly with what you were saying.
The media makes it look like everyone that believes in this one religion is violent.
When in reality it is just a different way of looking at the world and morals.
Religion isnt something that you were born with, it is a concept.
Someone's religion shouldn't deter them from being a good person.
When Sam initially started talking about Basim as any other normal person, I kind of blanked out because I almost saw it as something unimportant.
When the slide came up about Basim's house, it peaked my interest.
He was just so quick to forgive.
He just seemed like such a wholesome person, I just did not think he deserved something like that.
It is wrong to disturb someone's life that way when they have no fault whatsoever.
Sometimes all we need is a different perspective to shed light on our troubles and put them in their places of importance.
It is stories like his that make us reevaluate what is and is not important in our lives and what we should be concerning ourselves with.
We should follow his example of forgiveness and compassion to others who have wronged us.
I was also touched by how he stated that he believes God saved him for a reason.
I agree that this reason is to show us a different perspective and guide us toward a better path in life.
The news companies in America are trying to make profits and have to report on what people are going to watch.
What it does is show Americans that these terrorists are bad people, but that can lead us to think everyone there is bad, which is not true.
Even to the point where they would vacation together and they helped him move past what happened.
I thought this was kicking a man when he was down.
Hearing this in class all I could think was how dare they.
And that instead, people needed to know what is happening in his country, as well as, he also saw the opportunity of learning from other countries.
I always thought it was dumb though that someone could tell someone else that they wont go to heaven because of their sexuality.
Religion has always been something I had trouble getting behind.
I also like how he compared Sharia Law to Christian Sharia.
When you look at what both religions prohibit are say you should do if you want to get in heaven they are basically identical.
That really made me think about how I go about forming an opinion on someone elses religion.
Before this class I was under the impression that Christianity and Islam were two totally different religions.
I think that could have been because of how I was getting my information.
After all when you look at the bare bones of these two religions me living a life of a Good Christian could also be living a life of a Good Muslim.
I agree with exactly the same point that youre trying to make.
If you were to talk to someone in the military who has spent a substantial amount of time over in these areas, youd get a much better view of how the vast majority of people over there are just the same as us.
Those examples do not represent what the faith is about and speaking to someone who is Muslim will educate people the correct way and help them better understand.
Just how if the KKK organized a killing and named it after Christianity, many Christians would claim that has nothing to do with their religion and discredit the KKKs actions.
In addition, some Jewish men grow out long sideburns and dress in formal clothes every day and wear Yamikas.
Yet no one ever thinks of these people as oppressed.
I feel that the only one a woman could be oppressed by wearing a hijab is if she wants to not where one is being forced against her will to do so, which is not the case a majority of the time.
This example really resonated with me because I feel as though I never really stepped back and tried to see other cultures from a point of view other than my White, Christian, American view.
I was also raised Christian but would not consider myself a religious person.
I agree that there were aspects to this class that could have been improved in some ways, but I did learn some things about the black experience in America that I didn't know before.
The reason being that the gangs in the US do not operate by the blessing of the church, gang members are not lured into the gangster life by using religion.
It is as important to condemn the ideology propagating these attacks as the attacks itself, which is what Islamic leaders have failed to condemn and must be called out on.
I encourage everyone do your own research when it comes to wars in other countries youll definitely learn more than what are news wants us to know.
Everyone believes in their own religion or personal preferences and should have the right to and not feel judged in the country that they live in.
Regardless of the reasons, governments are rarely to ever become transparent.
Likely, the bombing at Basims house was reported but only documented with no action past that.
You can imagine the destruction that happened after the USA dropped the MOAB bomb on a town to kill a handful of ISIS fighters.
This is something that I personally struggle with.
As a Christian, I strive for that kind of quality and again this illustrates how those people who practice Islam and Christianity can find plenty of common ground in the fact that their values are similar.
This is why Sam says that traveling the world is an important experience; it puts a face to all of those faceless people in the world and forces us to confront them as real people and recognize their issues as legitimate.
You can tell this man is extremely wise just because of how intelligent he was, to not hold onto the anger.
Their adversity and courage inspires me, however, because they hold no resentment towards us American citizens because they know how it feels to be in a situation where their country is acting in ways that they might not have approved of.
It is a lot easier to point the finger to somebody else besides yourself.
However, the only way to fix this is to teach the value of empathy just like Dr. Richards is teaching it to us.
I also really enjoyed hearing Basim speak in class because it made me realize a whole other perspective to look at the issues that we face in the middle east.
I believe that interference in other countries by the United States is not only necessary but can be very helpful as a whole.
If we start telling other cultures how to live than essentially we are no better than ISIS.
But as you said before I thought it was really horrific how Basim described and showed his city.
I take life in the United States for granted sometimes.
He has not spoken about Latinos at all since classes started and it was bit concerning to me.
I felt a bit left out of the conversation because I am a Latino man.
He said that he spent time last semester talking about Latinos but his class changes every year.
I felt better knowing that conversation on my people would come around sooner than later.
Another topic he discussed was peoples inclination that middle eastern people are all bad.
I think that is a perfect conversation to have because it is a hot topic right now.
However, I am surprised to see why he didn't do that.
I could not understand how he could be so calm either.
I think the way you expressed his actual feelings is very true.
When you expressed that his religion tells him to act in that manner, it truly showcases how peaceful of a religion Islam is, contrary to popular belief here in the United States.
Ravi was able to clear any misconceptions that the media could have taught us and he showed that we are all very similar.
I chose this one because I believe a lot of people tend to forget war doesnt only affect soldiers it also affects innocent civilians in that country.
In the video Sam was talking about what is happening in the U.S.
People fail to realize this is a real place with real people as Sam also stated.
He introduces his friend Rafi, They met through NATO who came up with the pam to start dialogues between soldiers with military cadets in conflict zones.
It is sad because his job consists of trying to keep the peace in that country.
He also wants to make Afghanistan a better place for his daughters when they grow up.
I am really glad you are enjoying the class and I find myself enjoying it for similar reasons.
The strength Bassim has in continuing to forgive is remarkable.
But I dont think its fair in any way.
The point that you make about asking average Americans whether or not they feel safer knowing that our government has bombed the house of such a kind-hearted, normal man like Bassim is a very good one.
However, after talking with Bassim, its like getting slapped in the face with the knowledge that weve just been turning a blind eye to the tragedies that have befallen innocent men, women, and children as a result of the irresponsible and reckless actions of our government and our military because its too sad for us to think about.
Hello Monique I thought this video was pretty upsetting too.
If something like this happened to my family I don't think I could ever forgive the people that were the ones to blame.
When you hear stories like this it really makes you wonder why this war is even going on over there.
Also after seeing this video it makes me wonder how many more stories like this exist that we don't hear of?
I really think you brought up some good points.
This was one of the videos I considered writing my response to as well.
After watching this video, I wondered too why more Americans weren't mad about all the outcomes that war has.
I think that he was very strong to be able to move on from something like that.
I experienced death in my family as well and first hand I know that it is extremely difficult to overcome something like that.
I also think that we are extremely grateful to be present in a relatively safe and stable country, and try to be empathetic towards others who aren't so lucky.
One of the things that Sam points out is that he is trying to get us to put ourselves in other peoples shoes.
People may think that they are actively putting themselves in other peoples shoes in order to understand the undertakings that they deal with every day, but maybe theyre not fully immersed in that persons culture.
In order to fully comprehend what another person is feeling empathy is needed and that in itself is a difficult thing to achieve.
If we just had a better understanding of other peoples lives maybe there would not be so many conflicts between countries.
I myself am constantly trying to empathize with other people on a daily basis because I rather have empathy for someone than hate them.
I would want someone to have the same courtesy towards me if the roles were switched.
Maybe even world peace would not just be a goal but an actual reality.
Because of everything going with Middle East we don't think about the people's lives there.
They are also human being and not all everyone who lives in Middle East are the terrorist.
However, after hearing Basims story I feel much more connected to the war and its implication.
Things are getting better but it won't get back to normal any time soon.
His response stuck with me since this lecture because I strongly agree.
He explained, that everything happens for a reason.
G-d gave him another chance at life why would he suffer and be sad during his life.
Of course he misses them, but there is nothing he can do about it.
I agree that everything happens for a reason.
Like he said in the end of this video chat was that a good old girl friend came back into his life.
As long as he is happy that's all that matters.
Just remember, everything happens for a reason.
Although that sounds kind of depressing in some ways, I feel this way because I dont think there is any way I can change what is happening in society today.
It challenged my thinking and made me look at things a different way than I would have normally.
Sam, then, talked about how the same reason the United States military went into Iraq was for oil.
The war we are starting is effecting the lives of innocent Iraq citizens.
After Sam gave a talk and it got a lot of interest in the Middle East, on man named Bassim reached out to Sam to tell him that everything he said in the talk was correct.
The talked challenged people to try to put themselves in the shoes of someone living over in Iraq.
One day, Sam got a bunch of notifications on his phone and found out that Bassims house had been bombed.
He said thats what his religion taught him, and thats how he will live.
While this was fine, when I got to college I realized there was always so much going on in the media during day to day life that I really was not aware of situations happening around me.
However, for the most part this was all towards stuff happening in the United States.
In this class alone so far I have been caught up to date with so much going on.
I feel as if people were more knowing about what was happening about the world around how they would be more concerned and willing to help.
Achievement obtained fighting for what our founding fathers believed in.
It' has been to indisputable what is written in this clause and a stop must be put to the Religious Freedom Bills that are being approved.
He commented that he wanted everyone to be aware of everyone around you, and that there is life outside the U.S.
He said that there are regular people out there, people that want the same things that we do.
I am upset to say that I was not aware of this before this class, but that is why I am to college, to learn and this class has given me that opportunity.
To improve the learning of other countries Bassim said to do our own personal research.
Just like Bassim said, if we make it a goal of ours to be involved in other countries, I believe that we would be more accepting of diversity.
To be more accepting of diversity this can break down stereotypes that people have of groups different from their own.
It is pretty hard for the United States to effectively learn about other cultures because of our media effects most of what news they want the viewers to be exposed to.
When reading your response, I agree with you that Bassims advice to the class is really important.
I also believed that being in this sociology class has kept me updated with stuff that other countries are going through.
I also agree that many misunderstandings and tragedies would be lessened if the people are more aware of other cultures, customs, and values.
This all can be done with global awareness, but this is not happening enough.
Just like you, I think it is also important to encourage college students to keep up with world news, they are the new generations that will be making a difference.
The way Sam was talking about bombed house completely opened my eyes and reminded me that Iraq not just a battlefield, but it is a country with innocent people that just trying to live their lives peacefully.
This is one of the reason why revolution in Ukraine happened.
However it is pretty clear that this war is not for the land, but to destabilize already weakened by corruption Ukrainian economy even more so later on this land would be easy to take.
Additionally, I can relate to being guilty of not doing enough of my own personal research.
I do believe that if more people managed to find the time to educate what was going on around us, and looked past what only the media was portraying to us then we could realize we are similar to so many around us.
But I also want to say that it's not just our fault, because this is what we learned from news; news that only reports about terrorism.
And what we can do to reduce prejudice on an individual level is to learn about other cultures actively.
Because if you use your map of reality to look at other people's map of reality, you will distort their map.
I think what Dr. Smith said correlates what Sam motivates us to do, put aside our beliefs first so that we can treat other cultures fairly.
I think it is a very good point that being angry at others does nothing but harm yourself.
It is crucial to understand who caused the problem you are in, similar to how Mr. Razzo did, because he could differentiate that the problem was not from the general Americans but from the government.
There is a high possibility that they see us just as we see them because both the religions have different perspectives.
This is similar to another saying: treat others the way you want to be treated.
Nothing that is happening in the world around us is a constant thing, every day begins a new journey and the world will never stop changing.
I also grew up Christian, but as of recently I have decided that I want to be a Buddhist, and there is nothing stopping me from being able to practice Buddhism, which I think is a really awesome thing.
He touches on views of all different religions, focusing on the phobia of the Islam culture and religion.
I think this is really eye-opening, because growing up in American culture teaches us ethnocentric beliefs.
When I put myself into the shoes of someone who follows a religion other than my own I gain perspective, which not many Americans have these days.
Empathy is such a hard thing for people who are sheltered to learn.
Once we learn perception, empathy becomes so much easier to obtain.
I consider myself to be bias because I am a special needs person who only has the United states point of view since I lived in this country all my life.
I agree with that because of what I am doing.
The best to teach about something like he did is a person who has lived that event.
To me and the war is just be more educated and understanding of what is going on in the world.
The world is scary but wake up because you live here and need to know what is going on.
All I can say about Basim is that he is an amazing man who deserves so much in this world.
If something like this were to happen to me, I would still be angry, how could someone take everything I loved away from me in the blink of an eye when I wasnt even part of the war that is going on around me and be given some ridiculously small amount of money to make up for the fact that my family is dead.
Basim is such inspiration because he shows that no matter what life throws at you, if you stand with your God, you can have another outlook on life.
While Basim is forgiving, he also said he wants justice for what happened to his family.
He said it was basically a nightmare, and that it was very difficult to get back into the city.
I also found it super interesting to hear Basim say that he is Muslim, but he does not want to be ruled by Muslim leaders.
Basim did not blame Americans, but the American government.
Instead of hating anyone from the country of the United States of America, he really dug deep and thought about who caused this nightmare.
Growing up, we learn about the high points in Americas history and everything we have done in order to become the country that we are.
Bassim lived in Mosul, Iraq when it was unrecognizable from the Mosul of today.
His house looked beautiful and was surrounded by entire neighborhoods of equally beautiful homes.
But still, he found a way to get past his anger.
If this had happened to me, I don't think I ever would have been able to forgive.
Bassim said he was angry for a while but realized his anger hurt him more than it benefit him.
This also speaks to how details can get lost in the big picture.
If someone unfamiliar with people living in the United States was shown what our government did to Bassim's home in Mosul, I would not be surprised if they made a quick judgement that the United States and everyone in it is violent.
We would all like to think that we make a little bit of a difference when we cast our vote every four years, and every four years some people are thrilled and some are bitterly disappointed by the result of the presidential election - it often seems like the world is saved or the world is ending.
However, Basim drew attention to how little actually changes with the changes in leadership.
When President Trump was elected, I was bitterly disappointed.
However, very little has actually happened.
This gives me hope for Americas future, but also draws attention to the stagnation that bureaucracy creates - if we are safe from negative change, we are also stuck when it comes to positive change.
Basim truly drew attention to this when he said that each administration promises that they will end the corruption in the Iraqi government, and yet nothing has happened.
This fact - that the foreign policy under an Islamophobic president will remain largely the same as it was under a president like Obama - is terrifying.
We may feel better when someone new comes into power, but we all need to educate ourselves on what the actual policies are, and how these policies affect people worldwide.
I chose this clip because I too was curious about this question and was intrigued by the response.
First off, I thought it was an incredible experience to hear Basim talk.
It was great to get a perspective from someone on the other side.
I was interested to hear how he had dealt with all the hardships that have occurred in his life.
The response he gave to the question, How are you not angry with America, was shocking at first but made complete sense.
I think some people believe that everyone following this same religion is harmful, but generalizations should not be made.
Another thing that stood out to me was that he said that the problem is with the government not the American people.
I think Basim is very strong for overcoming this anger and being able to forgive after everything he has been through.
This is when one would realize that it is not worth it to be angry anymore and the only person that is being hurt by it is yourself.
I thought this was a great clip and agree that Basim is an amazing man.
He and the other people who had their houses destroyed deserve so much more than what the American government offered them.
I would be angry for a longer period of time too, but after a while I think I would realize the same thing that Basim did.
He realized that it was not worth being angry anymore because it was only harming him.
In addition, you mention that people would turn away from their religion, and I did not think about this until now but this could be very true.
Instead of turning away from religion, Basim turns to his religion to lead him to forgiveness, which shows how powerful a religion can be to someone.
I think forgiving helps him cope and not be so angry so he can try to be happy again.
Sam discusses how he starts classes differently depending on what he is excited about and I think that it is a really miraculous aspect of the class considering the way a school normally works.
From my experience, teachers teach based off a pretty straight forward schedule starting with introductory material and moving into more detailed lessons.
One of the things that this class has provided me with thus far, is the ability to take a step back from my biases and see things from a different perspective.
More recently, I was able to step into someone elses shoes when we talked about how Christians are never talked down on as compared to Muslims even though Christians have committed heinous acts against people.
We live in a Christian-based society where people are so quick to call a Muslim violent when the same arguments they use against Muslims can be thrown right back at Christians.
His question was When you think about the United States political leaders since they came into the Iraq war; is there a difference between them for you and the Iraqi people?
I knew our troops were over there trying to keep the civilians safe, so I assumed our leaders were trying hard too.
Basim also stated that politicians are pocketing the benefits that should be going elsewhere.
I know we have problems within our own country that we also need to focus on but I feel empathy for the people in Afghanistan.
Saying that nothing has changed since 2003 is crazy to hear.
My initial reaction was that the reason I was so far off everytime Sam asked us to guess a statistic (for example, of the 963 people killed by police officers in 2016 in the United States, how many of them were black?)
I have a theory as to why the media tends to shy away from showing statistics like these.
I was the reason that I overestimated underestimated these statistics.
It is much easier for people to listen to the news because they have already done all the research for us (so it seems).
If we truly want to get the full picture, we have to do research on our own time, and seek out data that could contradict our beliefs.
Caring enough to take the time out of your day to research statistics that could potentially invalidate what you believe isn't easy.
I find myself feeling ashamed of wanting to go into the media right now for two reasons.
We can do our own research, even if we know there's a possibility the statistics or evidence may prove us wrong.
If we make this the new normal, the media may be more inclined to present more statistics, and therefore more facets of the story.
Sam had brought a good topic about what his main objective is and sort of the main takeaway from his class.
Those people who are Christians and kill people are for somewhat not considered to be Christians, but for the Muslims that idea does not actually work.
I, personally, have no response to this because for one I am very intrigued since I have not thought of that before.
One of the key concept you mentioned on your reply was the idea of media influencing our thoughts and perception going around the world.
But, we see repeatedly news on police brutality and the idea that Black are being killed by polices and that it is unlawful.
So, I want to say you have clearly explained what a misinterpretation we had on police brutality of the Black race and yet we do not see the media showing these statistics because, as you said, it undermines the movement and usually media covers what people are interested in and if people are the reason we have these misinterpretations of police brutality then we have no one else but ourselves to blame.
When Sam brought up Saddam Hussein, I immediately made a connection because my grandfather actually worked for Saddam Hussein at a particular point.
I was not aware that we went into Iraq because of Oil.
The slideshow of Bassam with his wife just showed that they were normal individuals.
These people are not always at war and that's what we need to come to terms with.
A lot of people just envision Iraq as this place of war and destruction but in all actuality, there are places (like the mall) that look just how the malls in New Jersey look.
Never would I thought, we would be able to Skype Bassam but when he popped up, I just wanted to give him a big hug.
Its so abnormal (for Americans in America) to think of how our lives would be affected in a war.
I wondered how his everyday life had been affected by all the conflict.
A man his age has lived through some extremely difficult times in Iraq.
There are already some things that have changed around Mosul.
I knew that there had been changes, however I was not aware of the specific ones made.
If a group of people came into America and prohibited all citizens from doing certain things, I would not know how to react.
It was interesting to hear from someone who actually lives in Iraq and see their point of view on it.
During the class from minutes 38-the end is the part I will be discussing.
I enjoyed discovering that when they are home they do not cover up.
They don't have to wear hijab around men they can't marry.
Another fact I am glad I learned.
I also find it interesting how he would like to go back to his nightmare.
The separation of church and state and it should be separate in his opinion was very interesting since he is Muslim and Muslims live everyday based on their religion.
Those qualities to have when learning about this topic are very important.
I also had the question as to how other countries view our government.
When Basim was sharing I was questioning How is this reality?
The women who wore the Hijab's were completely fine with what they were wearing.
I would never change my clothing because of men but it was interesting to see how some women are still under a man's control.
In their eyes they probably did not see modesty as oppression but to me, a western woman i saw it as men having the ultimate power.
Special needs is a topic that needs to be discussed and better understood.
That's a strength rather than a weakness.People with special needs should not be seen as a human with problems but rather praised for being able to see the world in a different light.
As long as people are educated and aware there really is no way to force a person to care about one thing over another.
Basim talking about his experience also shed some light for me.
It is hard to see that our country has caused so much hurt to innocents, but I think more people should be made aware of it.
I feel like what happened in Mosul should be far more common knowledge than it is.
However, I think Americans' demand may contribute to why we do not always see this sort of coverage.
We do not want to see our country devastating the lives of innocents so it is not shown to us as frequently as it ought to be.
The first thing he pointed out was that this is the same question someone asked last year in Sams class.
I found this very interesting because how can so many of us be thinking the same thing, yet be completely wrong.
Why is it that we think Basim is so angry and full of hatred when he later establishes that he is not?
I question if I would be able to say the same had I been in his shoes.
He instead narrowed it down to the only Americans that really played a role in what happened to him and his family.
I found this intriguing because, as a Christian, the Bible would say to forgive and not be full of hatred as well.
It is frustrating when you feel as though you have no control over the place where you live and call home.
Then tragedy struck when his house was bombed, killing his closest family members.
Since everything has happened, Basim has been back to Mosul to visit.
Since the war on ISIS, Mosul has been destroyed.
It is hard to even wrap my head around the amount of loss that these people are going through, and how even when the city is rebuilt how these people will be able to continue living their lives with what had happened to them.
Most people lost not only their houses but family members, something that can never be replaced.
I think Basim is an extremely strong man for reacting the way he did.
Also, I like what you said about details getting lost in the big picture.
The fact that he did not judge all of us proves how great of a man he truly is.
We all have some idea of what it is like to live in Afghanistan for example, and an idea of what the people are like there.
Our education system lacks in teaching us about history and geography around the world, and it will never teach us everything we should know.
I also just thought that is was because of religious purposes.
I also found it interesting to find out that behind closed doors they actually wear similar things to what people here in the United States wear.
For example, one student said that they actually wear normal bathing suits when they are just hanging around with other women.
The newer part is getting better, and all five bridges were bombed so its hard to get across the river.
He finds it difficult to go back to Mosul but expects to be back in the next four months.
I personally would never be able to go back to that if I was in his situation.
I thought it was very cool when he said that a lot of his friends were of the Christian religion.
If I were Bassim and my entire family was killed in a random bombing, I would be extremely upset and angry and would definitely struggle to forgive and get over this anger.
During lecture, I was wondering the same question that the girl asked, how could Bassim not be angry with us, Americans, who essentially caused him to lose everything he had in his life over a randomized incident?
I feel as though his response was somewhat inspiring.
What really inspired me though, was his ability to get over it.
I still though, cannot understand or fathom how he was able to use something as simple as religion to overcome this obstacle.
I think this hit hard for me because we saw photographs of Bassim in America.
He said he lived here for eight or so years, always being respected by other American citizens.
Thus, I found the entire lecture inspiring and gave me something to really think about.
I did not come from a very religious family so maybe the bible was taught to me a different way from a young age, but I regard the bible as just readings, not my way of life.
The idea of using the Bible to resolve controversial topics like discrimination and abortion is not rational considering these issues are very prominent in our modern day society and the bible was written thousands of years ago.
However, it does not provide every rule for the varying situations that these crimes present and that is where it becomes hard to interpret what the bible is actually trying to say.
When Sam asked us to discuss the numbers for police brutality of black people, my number was way off as well.
But, is it really helping us?
We need to take action today, because if we dont, tomorrow will be an even bigger sight of confusion, violence, and discomfort.
No one ever stops to think, and try to imagine things from other persons perspective.
You can even say it is the same thing with judging a black person from a white persons perspective.
I believe this is one of the biggest problems with the world and why so many conflicts end up arising.
The best example of this mentioned in the video was when Sam was talking about Muslim terrorists.
When he was talking about the things that ISIS made the people of Mosul do, it made me think about the muslim men in my community at home.
Im not sure if the same meaning is taught in ISIS groups.
I think that when something big effects a people as a whole, especially in a negative way it is hard for one to hope that the future will go back to normal or be better.
I thought you made a great analogy when you closed your response by saying treat others, as you want to be treated.
People love to be quick to judge, but they never take the time to truly try to understand it from another persons perspective.
For example, it is easy to judge that Muslims are terrorists after you see a small group of them do something terrible.
What you do not often realize is that the majority of Muslims condemn this the same way we do.
I believe no one has the right to judge unless you jump into another persons shoes and think of the situation from their perspective.
Bassim explained that we need to take advantage of the new forms of communication we have to chat and relate to people across the world.
We as a nation are very self centered when it comes to our global views and beliefs.
We do not attempt to reach out to people who live in different countries enough despite having all of the proper technology to do so.
I feel that we do this because we are uncomfortable trying to connect with people from different cultures.
I find this to be a very sad because there is clearly so much to learn from the world around us.
After all, we were able to Skype Bassim from across the map so we know it is possible.
We have many different outlets to the world at our fingertips, and I feel very motivated to utilize them.
Another point that Bassim made was how much our media influences us as a country.
Everyone is constantly worrying about their social status in the media rather than focusing on genuine human connection.
When this question was asked the first thing that ran through my mind was obviously it posed a negative threat on them.
Although that is correct, I did not even consider the depth that Basims answer would be.
I was ignorant to the fact that ISIS is terrorizing not only the land, but its people too.
